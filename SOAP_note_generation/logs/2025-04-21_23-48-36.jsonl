The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. Don't add anything of your own.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes: Patient L.V.G.**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nPatient L.V.G., an 81-year-old female, reports difficulties with verbal fluency, particularly when asked to generate words with specific constraints, such as words starting with the letter \"S.\" She has previously undergone speech therapy in January of the previous year, which she found unhelpful. Despite these challenges, she reports no cognitive disabilities impacting her reading, writing, or texting. L.V.G. plays bridge online and engages in watercolor painting, which she finds beneficial for cognitive engagement. She indicates she communicates better in the mornings, as she feels her speech deteriorates as the day progresses. L.V.G. uses an Alexa device to assist with daily tasks, noting that while some people struggle to understand her on the phone, Alexa does understand her, albeit sometimes with difficulty. She expresses confidence in her ability to use Alexa for various tasks, including managing appointments, alarms, and reminders, independently, although she occasionally requires repetition for understanding complex instructions.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nEvaluation involved a series of tasks designed to assess cognitive and communication abilities:  \n- **Verbal Repetition and Recall Tasks:** Patient had some difficulty with immediate recall of lists and the word recall test. She frequently needed repetition of instructions or phrases.\n- **Activity of Naming and Categorization:** L.V.G. demonstrated strong categorization skills with a large number of states and animals named correctly, though had some difficulty with categorizing in abstract terms.\n- **Concepts of Time and Orientation:** Correctly identified the current month, day, year, and seasonal information. She displayed a good grasp of general knowledge questions about holidays and numerical facts.\n- **Simple Yes/No Questions:** Demonstrated inconsistency, recognizing the phrasing challenge but correcting responses appropriately upon reflection.\n- **Picture Description Task:** Provided a detailed and accurate description of a familiar picture scenario, suggesting intact descriptive language abilities.\n- **Alexa Task Simulation:** Expressed confidence in executing voice commands independently across various life scenarios including setting alarms, reminders, and searching for information, reflecting her proficiency with the device.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nPatient L.V.G. exhibits mild expressive language deficits primarily characterized by word-finding difficulties, which align with her report of aphasia symptoms. These deficits are compounded by challenges in verbal memory and processing speed, impacting her verbal fluency, especially under structured language tasks. Her engagement in cognitive and creative activities, like bridge and painting, suggests good overall cognitive function and adaptability. L.V.G.'s use of Alexa indicates her capacity for technology-assisted compensation strategies, although her confidence may overestimate her independent capability in high-stakes or unfamiliar situations.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- **Speech Therapy:** Recommend a re-evaluation for speech-language therapy focusing on strategies for word retrieval and fluency. Emphasis should be placed on conversational practice and working within constraints (e.g., verbal fluency tasks).\n- **Alexa Training Enhancement:** Encourage continued use of Alexa with a focus on expanding proficiency in voice commands. Monitor progress with caregiver support as needed.\n- **Cognitive Stimulation:** Continue engaging in activities such as bridge, painting, or similar cognitive activities to maintain neural plasticity.\n- **Follow-up:** Schedule a reassessment in 6 months or sooner if noticeable change occurs in communication, memory, or daily functioning.\n- **Home Exercise Program:** Incorporate structured tasks utilizing Alexa, such as setting alarms/reminders, to reinforce learned skills and build autonomy.\n- **Peer Support and Engagement:** Consider joining a support group aimed at individuals with aphasia for social engagement and shared strategies.\n\n\nResponse: The SOAP note for patient L.V.G. is well-structured and comprehensive, adhering to the standard format effectively. \n\n**Subjective (S):** The subjective section provides a clear and detailed account of the patient's experiences and challenges with verbal fluency, including specific examples and context. It includes relevant personal activities and the patient's perception of her abilities, which adds depth to the understanding of her condition.\n\n**Objective (O):** The objective section is thorough, detailing the results of various cognitive and communication assessments. It clearly distinguishes between the patient's strengths and areas of difficulty, providing a well-rounded view of her current abilities.\n\n**Assessment (A):** The assessment synthesizes the subjective and objective findings well, identifying mild expressive language deficits and their impact on the patient's verbal fluency. It acknowledges the patient's cognitive engagement and adaptability, offering a balanced view of her condition.\n\n**Plan (P):** The plan is comprehensive and patient-specific, outlining a clear course of action that includes speech therapy, technology use, cognitive stimulation, follow-up, and social engagement. Each component is relevant to the patient's needs and supports her continued independence and cognitive health.\n\nOverall, the SOAP note is well-organized, clear, and provides a detailed and actionable plan for patient L.V.G., making it a valuable tool for ongoing care.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting.

And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright.\n \n00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:54.020\nSpeaker 1: This one.\n \n00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:07.109\nSpeaker 2: The order was a little switched, and you missed one as well. So but that's fine. That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that.

And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes: Patient L.V.G.**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nPatient L.V.G., an 81-year-old female, reports difficulties with verbal fluency, particularly when asked to generate words with specific constraints, such as words starting with the letter \"S.\" She has previously undergone speech therapy in January of the previous year, which she found unhelpful. Despite these challenges, she reports no cognitive disabilities impacting her reading, writing, or texting. L.V.G. plays bridge online and engages in watercolor painting, which she finds beneficial for cognitive engagement. She indicates she communicates better in the mornings, as she feels her speech deteriorates as the day progresses. L.V.G. uses an Alexa device to assist with daily tasks, noting that while some people struggle to understand her on the phone, Alexa does understand her, albeit sometimes with difficulty. She expresses confidence in her ability to use Alexa for various tasks, including managing appointments, alarms, and reminders, independently, although she occasionally requires repetition for understanding complex instructions.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nEvaluation involved a series of tasks designed to assess cognitive and communication abilities:  \n- **Verbal Repetition and Recall Tasks:** Patient had some difficulty with immediate recall of lists and the word recall test. She frequently needed repetition of instructions or phrases.\n- **Activity of Naming and Categorization:** L.V.G. demonstrated strong categorization skills with a large number of states and animals named correctly, though had some difficulty with categorizing in abstract terms.\n- **Concepts of Time and Orientation:** Correctly identified the current month, day, year, and seasonal information. She displayed a good grasp of general knowledge questions about holidays and numerical facts.\n- **Simple Yes/No Questions:** Demonstrated inconsistency, recognizing the phrasing challenge but correcting responses appropriately upon reflection.\n- **Picture Description Task:** Provided a detailed and accurate description of a familiar picture scenario, suggesting intact descriptive language abilities.\n- **Alexa Task Simulation:** Expressed confidence in executing voice commands independently across various life scenarios including setting alarms, reminders, and searching for information, reflecting her proficiency with the device.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nPatient L.V.G. exhibits mild expressive language deficits primarily characterized by word-finding difficulties, which align with her report of aphasia symptoms. These deficits are compounded by challenges in verbal memory and processing speed, impacting her verbal fluency, especially under structured language tasks. Her engagement in cognitive and creative activities, like bridge and painting, suggests good overall cognitive function and adaptability. L.V.G.'s use of Alexa indicates her capacity for technology-assisted compensation strategies, although her confidence may overestimate her independent capability in high-stakes or unfamiliar situations.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- **Speech Therapy:** Recommend a re-evaluation for speech-language therapy focusing on strategies for word retrieval and fluency. Emphasis should be placed on conversational practice and working within constraints (e.g., verbal fluency tasks).\n- **Alexa Training Enhancement:** Encourage continued use of Alexa with a focus on expanding proficiency in voice commands. Monitor progress with caregiver support as needed.\n- **Cognitive Stimulation:** Continue engaging in activities such as bridge, painting, or similar cognitive activities to maintain neural plasticity.\n- **Follow-up:** Schedule a reassessment in 6 months or sooner if noticeable change occurs in communication, memory, or daily functioning.\n- **Home Exercise Program:** Incorporate structured tasks utilizing Alexa, such as setting alarms/reminders, to reinforce learned skills and build autonomy.\n- **Peer Support and Engagement:** Consider joining a support group aimed at individuals with aphasia for social engagement and shared strategies.\n\n\nResponse: The SOAP note for Patient L.V.G. is well-structured and comprehensive, covering all necessary components effectively.\n\n**Subjective (S):** The subjective section provides a clear and detailed account of the patient's self-reported symptoms and experiences. It includes relevant information about her previous speech therapy, daily activities, and use of Alexa, which adds depth to the understanding of her condition. The note captures the patient's perspective on her communication challenges and her strategies for managing them.\n\n**Objective (O):** The objective section is thorough, detailing the various tasks used to assess the patient's cognitive and communication abilities. It effectively highlights her strengths and areas of difficulty, providing a balanced view of her current status. The inclusion of specific tasks and the patient's performance on them adds credibility and clarity to the assessment.\n\n**Assessment (A):** The assessment synthesizes the subjective and objective findings well, identifying mild expressive language deficits and their impact on the patient's verbal fluency. It acknowledges her cognitive strengths and adaptability, particularly her use of technology for compensation. The assessment is logical and aligns with the information provided in the previous sections.\n\n**Plan (P):** The plan is comprehensive and tailored to the patient's needs. It includes recommendations for speech therapy, continued use of Alexa, cognitive stimulation, and follow-up assessments. The plan also suggests practical steps for reinforcing skills and promoting autonomy, such as a home exercise program and peer support. This section effectively addresses both immediate and long-term strategies for managing the patient's condition.\n\nOverall, the SOAP note is well-organized, detailed, and provides a clear roadmap for the patient's ongoing care. It successfully integrates the patient's subjective experiences with objective findings to form a coherent assessment and plan.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}
