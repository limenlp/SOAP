Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 (Week 2) R.T.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  Speaker: Assistant\nRole: Healthcare Provider\nSource: Medical Documentation\n\nIntroduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare, providing a structured framework for evaluating patient information. This document will detail the components of a SOAP note and its significance in clinical practice.\n\nFunction\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThis section documents the subjective experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient. It provides context for the Assessment and Plan sections. Key components include:\n- Chief Complaint (CC): The patient's reported symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or statement describing why they are presenting.\n- History of Present Illness (HPI): A detailed account of the patient's CC, organized using the OLDCARTS acronym.\n- Medical history: Current or past medical conditions relevant to the case.\n- Surgical history: Important surgeries and their details.\n- Family history: Pertinent family medical history.\n- Social History: Information about the patient's home environment, education, employment, eating habits, activities, drug use, sexuality, and suicide/depression risk.\n- Review of Systems (ROS): A system-based list of questions to uncover symptoms not mentioned by the patient.\n\nObjective\nThis section documents objective data from the patient encounter. It includes:\n- Vital signs: Temperature, pulse, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels.\n- Physical exam findings: Details about the patient's general appearance, specific body systems examination, and any abnormalities found.\n- Laboratory data: Test results related to the case.\n- Imaging results: Results from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or other imaging tests.\n- Other diagnostic data: Any additional test results relevant to the case.\n\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes:\n- Problem list: A prioritized list of problems or diagnoses.\n- Differential Diagnosis: A list of potential diagnoses, ranked by likelihood.\n- Discussion: Explanation of the thought process behind the differential diagnosis.\n\nPlan\nThis section outlines the steps to address the patient's illnesses, including:\n- Testing needed and rationale for each test.\n- Therapy or medications prescribed.\n- Specialist referrals or consultations required.\n- Patient education and counseling needs.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe SOAP note serves as an essential tool in organizing patient information, aiding clinical reasoning, and improving communication between healthcare providers. The note's structure helps ensure that important information is not overlooked and makes it easier for colleagues to understand the case and follow the treatment plan. However, the SOAP note does have limitations, such as its inability to document changes over time, which could be addressed through extensions like the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation).", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

(Debrief) 7-24-2025.m4a   RT, Speaker 2  Transcript  00:00:06 Speaker 1  So our first topic was information seeking and we discussed whether To Do List adding events to a calendar looking at local and international news sporting events. Seeking. And just seeking any information that we're curious about. And so let's find 2 activities related to this topic and practice in putting it to Gemini. And then stop sharing and then I'll have you take over R and go ahead and share your screen. Are you able to flip your Gemini?  00:00:56 Speaker 2  I'm trying to load it, but I think it's like showing like. UM. It's like not letting my e-mail not use it. So it says service not allowed.  00:01:09 Speaker 3  My bank to Gmail to.  00:01:11 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's in my personal e-mail. Yeah, need to. Tenses. OK. Can you guys see it says Hello, R, on there.  00:01:53 Speaker 1  I cannot. Maybe can you stop sharing and reshare? Maybe it needs to?  00:02:01 Speaker 2  Alright. Hello.  00:02:15 Speaker 1  Now yes. Alright, so for information seeking topic, is there a topic of interest you'd like to ask Gemini?  00:02:28 Speaker 2  Yes, they. The middle of summer. So like. Well, you know, I live in South Orange County, so we're like the US open is surfing is coming up. So like, let's see like when I know, I know that's always Huntington Beach main beach. But I don't know what time when.  00:02:46 Speaker 1  Oh yeah, that\u2019s a great question to ask Gemini.  00:02:51 Speaker 2  Because. So it's it's it's fun to people watch.  00:02:57 Speaker 1  I'm actually thinking about going.  00:02:59 Speaker 2  Yeah, so I was. Just walking up and down main and. Just like these people. Ohh no, she kicked the Huntington, then the 22nd through. August Spaghetti in August.  00:03:42 Speaker 1  Is there anything? Is there any more information you would like to know about the US Open?  00:03:47 Speaker 2  Yeah, because there's like this coming week to like 2 weeks. So what? Maybe I can answer. More facts about this. Here she has. Is what I feel like.  00:04:53 Speaker 1  OK, so it gives you the dates for. The long board components.  00:04:57 Speaker 2  Like I like, you know, some people like those little carvers like longboards, fun to ride is. I'm not. I'm not really a big surfer, but just like finding cruising. Yeah, like to see that, you know, main beach honey, she has his son has a tourist trap. But just watching be fun.  00:05:17 Speaker 1  Is there any important information that you'd like to know before going to see the longboards? Maybe something that Jim and I didn't say?  00:05:26 Speaker 2  They're really nice. Like location, actual location. It's just honey beach. So like Main Beach is a long place, like where you know, it's like they ask like what? What side of the pier or something like location.  00:05:42 Speaker 1  Yeah, or where to park or something?  00:05:44 Speaker 2  And where to park, Well, like it's giving a lot, this is just, you know, just type them into like my apple maps or something and pull into like, the main beach parking promenade is easy to get through and some of them like. One street over. We gotta pay for him. So it's. Like. Whenever you drive down there, see well, people go down and sneak around backside. So it's like good to have these suggestions to go through.  00:07:01 Speaker 1  Yeah, for sure. I feel like this is all really helpful that we could like. Put in our Apple maps.  00:07:11 Speaker 2  Yeah, I'm going to park there sometimes like. So maybe like Ohh park around that corner like 1 you walk, walk over one night, walk over to the beach or. No, there's a good steak fish Taco place down the aisle. You just sneak over.  00:07:29 Speaker 1  And that's another thing you could ask too, right?  00:07:35 Speaker 2 Yes.  00:07:36 Speaker 1  I know they only have a lot of vendors, right?  00:07:38 Speaker 2  They did have better for like the main pier antenna stalls up. You know, the Main Street, they got all those like little restaurants and they got parts out front carts out front. It's like sometimes, like when you sometimes surfing is early in the morning, you get a burrito one hand.  00:08:33 Speaker 1  Yeah, the best thing is in the morning.  00:08:36 Speaker 2  Yeah, like those people down here at the wage Newport, they're up. Daybreak. I'm just like. Going to bed.  00:08:49 Speaker 1  All right. Shock. 00:08:55 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's yeah, serious.  00:08:57 Speaker 1  You want to Scroll down and see what else.  00:09:00 Speaker 2  And sandy?  00:09:02 Speaker 1  Sandies.  00:09:06 Speaker 2  Water table. Water table is more a little high end. But it's it's good if you're with a group of. People that want it.  00:09:24 Speaker 1  Pacific hideaway.  00:09:26 Speaker 2  I think. Actually these are main off Main beach. So right there when you go that way, you see the right your left brake on the wave and you go there Scooter, scooter over the house coffee house so it's like. So.  00:09:46 Speaker 1  602.  00:09:47 Speaker 2  Except here. It's not. That was last time I went to 602. It just got like little raps. How much gonna walk right over?To the boardwalk and just like. It's good, like, you know, some nice and honey. Then when they have like the like, the farmers market out front on the main 602 walk right over memory.  00:10:12 Speaker 1  Yeah, and still check. Grab and go. You can like bring. It to the sand.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  I just remember I just. I've gone over to Huntington, down to the Woodies and it's good. Like. We have like a. BLT and just go watch ways good. It's good like thinking about later this summer.  00:10:38 Speaker 1  Yeah. These are great options. I think you can definitely save this chat for summer day.  00:10:44 Speaker 2  Yeah, this outfit.  00:10:45 Speaker 1  Whenever you want to go. Through the long boarding competitions.  00:10:48 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:10:49 Speaker 1  OK, we can move on to the next topic we discussed over the training. So the next thing we did was entertainment to get information related to media, listening to music, watching movies. Maybe even have Gemini generate stories or tell jokes or create trivia games. Is there a topic in entertainment that you would like to ask tonight?  00:11:21 Speaker 2  You know, like, you know, sarcasm people like like, it's funny or something fall flat, but sometimes like. After my injury, I take it straight. Serious but like even the one of my things before my injury, I knew sarcasm like that. So if you wait, I can ask her about. They sometimes people, maybe Gemini and I would have a good one, but like sarcasm jokes here one day and it worked out.  00:11:50 Speaker 1  Yeah, that'd be that'd be good for entertainment and.  00:11:53 Speaker 2  Like you know, entering the conversation, you're just just throw joke at people you know or just like. What is that?  00:12:02 Speaker 1  Yeah, I think that's a great topic to see what Gemini says.  00:12:06 Speaker 2  Ask her.  00:12:07 Speaker 1  Yeah. That one's good.  00:12:48 Speaker 2  Here's the funny. Why did this have her break up with the ocean cause like people like break up as a relationship? Because he was feeling like he was just going through the motions like he had like a relationship like the other person is. I'm just going through the motions. It's funny.  00:13:12 Speaker 1  Do you wanna? Ask for more jokes. Maybe even ask like, do you want them about surfing? Or you can pick a topic as well.  00:13:20 Speaker 2  Him on the topic because we were just talking about surfing earlier, so.  00:13:24 Speaker 1  Yeah, that's it. Perfect. You can maybe use that on Saturday.  00:14:01 Speaker 2  Because this weekend I'm going bowling with like a group of people. So like our cousin. Stop playing cards.  00:14:08 Speaker 1  That's fine.  00:14:14 Speaker 2  Because they heard the strikes were ragged.  00:14:21 Speaker 1  It's a busy weekend, bowling and surfing.  00:14:24 Speaker 2  I just like, well, I'm just watching surfing. They're like, well, I think that we're gonna probably go to. To see the longboarding next weekend, but this weekend I have the serving date so I just.So it's because the strikes were rigged. Trying to make it think about it.  00:14:47 Speaker 1  You know, me too, I'm. I know that the born straight.  00:14:50 Speaker 2  Stroke, he says. I can hit him all, but strikes rate.  00:14:55 Speaker 1  But I don't know much about cards. I wonder if there's a connection there somewhere.  00:14:59 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, I know basic card games. So this is like kind of in between for me.  00:15:07 Speaker 1  Maybe you could ask Gemini to explain the joke. I wonder what Gemini would say. Oh, I get it.  00:15:45 Speaker 2  There's strike like they do a strike.  00:15:50 Speaker 1  I I told her that went over my head.  00:15:53 Speaker 2  You mean on my head right now? So he asked her.  00:15:57 Speaker 1  OK, I get it. Well, at least Gemini and. I provided a really good explanation.  00:16:02 Speaker 2  You know, ask her why I like using her as like exchange the point like that. Like if I told that girl over there like said, she'd probably be like, get her busy. Hey. Explaining.  00:16:22 Speaker 1  I think that's a good. Saves. I know that you were telling me earlier that like, sometimes sarcasm is challenging for you to understand. Maybe if someone did say something. Like I can't. Talk like sarcastic or not like maybe. You can like. It's like ask Gemini. Can you explain this and then maybe? Why would people to provide like a more in depth explanation? That's funny. I totally that went over my head. I was like, I don't. I don't get it. I'm not laughing.  00:16:51 Speaker 2  You know, like, so these people like some people. Staying is how like it's trained on normal joke. Sometimes those go over your head too, but I can just like it's fun to everything but sarcasm. It's good to get back into.  00:17:07 Speaker 1  Yeah, definitely. Sometimes I don't understand. Sarcasm, I'm like. Are you are you being mean, are you? Like, are you being serious or like that? It's really hard to tell.  00:17:18 Speaker 2  It's like. So this is delivery like you sometimes right there. So you got a chip on your shoulder, that's sarcasm or if you just saying it straight on. Then that's you have been realized realistic with it. But see how you deliver it like you could shrug your shoulders. Of the like weird look at your face out there trying to take you out.  00:17:43 Speaker 1  Yeah. So looking at body.  00:17:47 Speaker 2  Cute, yeah.  00:17:48 Speaker 1  Body movements or Felix questions can kind of help you understand if it's sarcasm, but it's like Gemini. Honestly understand sarcasm. So you're very confused. You can ask them.  00:17:58 Speaker 2  He does.  00:18:01 Speaker 1  All right. And let's go to our next topic. That was self-care and medical needs, so. I know you're really good about taking your medication because you have your pill box, but maybe we can search for. Self keratin.  00:18:24 Speaker 2  OK.  00:18:26 Speaker 1  Or ways to improve our mental or physical health. What sounds most helpful or useful to you?  00:18:34 Speaker 2  Like self-care, like mental and physical health, just like mindset thing. Just.  00:18:41 Speaker 1  Remember, last time we did yoga?  00:18:42 Speaker 2  Yeah, yoga was going on that maybe there's something else you can pick.  00:18:46 Speaker 1  Yeah, maybe there's something else, that Gemma I can provide. Yeah. OK, so some breathing.  00:20:04 Speaker 2  You. Techniques. Yeah, I need to like actually implement the. I've heard about them and. I actually do them.  00:20:11 Speaker 1  Yeah, these are good. I like box breathing.  00:20:15 Speaker 2  Up there, up there, yeah.  00:20:18 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:20:20 Speaker 2  Count to 4.  00:20:24 Speaker 1  That one works really. Well, yeah.Mindfulness and meditation.  00:20:42 Speaker 2  Yeah. And like some of this. Well made neuro. Psych tells me about, like, living in the present and like. Even now not then or where you are, so it's like and also doing the full body scan like how you're carrying yourself and like eye contact. To. Judge yourself. The mirror is supposed to be. Your best friend, not like. You know good.  00:21:14 Speaker 1  Physical activity.  00:21:18 Speaker 2  Kind of like basic exercises and well, just, you know, being outdoors in the environment, just like nature, sounds, sounds and like peaceful. Like, you know, I love watching surfing and going to the beach and stuff, you know, walking on sand. It's always like just your nature. Like, the the breezes and like. I just like being outside, so just walking on the beach.Is always fun.  00:21:41 Speaker 1  Me too. That's one of my favorite self-care activities.  00:21:45 Speaker 2  Eating.  00:21:52 Speaker 1  And what's #4? Engage your senses and creativity.  00:21:57 Speaker 2  And also, just an animal snuck in there, like almost ready. Like I love it. So people bring their dogs to the beach. But like some dogs.  00:22:00 Speaker 1  Yeah, put an animal. Otherwise. Sounds, maybe you can set them. On the beach.  00:22:10 Speaker 2  Are not friendly. Some dogs hang out with their master only, but some really they come and sniff over to your brother nose right in your lap. But it's. Like. They're like humans. Social or not, saying this is like. Aromatherapy what smells is good, like sometimes name sense, like camomile, lavender, stitch just really soothing, but something he smells something else like. They got a cup of coffee like ohh I need to work. It's like sit there but they really fills your mind. Tell what you want to do. Like relax or go to work. Therapies. Good to check into, yeah.  00:23:03 Speaker 1  And then the fifth one, adjusting habits and mindset.  00:23:10 Speaker 2  Oh yeah, somebody's just for overall life screen time. Like I'm talking to you guys, but.After.  Off because like a bunch of their generation on the phone. Streamed TikTok. Ohh, you know, a lot of these therapies. And like talking to people, FaceTime or like talking you guys on zoom and stuff, a lot of interaction is digital. So it's like, oh, I think that we're probably getting used to this. All this is saying blue light to your eye or whatever. Yeah. Like this is kind of bad for your brain, but. Did it come back and it?  00:23:51 Speaker 1  I know that's why I wear my glasses so much more than wearing contacts because they have blue light in them because I'm always on my computer, I feel like.  00:23:56 Speaker 2  Oh. Probably, And also like having mentioned here. Diet, sleep. Those are important for your brain and overall health like. Get my. No, no, I take 9 hours of sleep, but I got a regular basis and my I'm ready to go and also eat my 3 meals and. Different mindset, yeah.  00:24:27 Speaker 1  Yeah, definitely. And.I think that it may be time to go back to the main room. I think we're ending our breakout rooms, is that correct? Doctor, you're heading back.  00:24:36 Speaker 2  OK.  00:24:42 Speaker 3  I was thinking if you're done, would you like to just directly go into individual feedback since we're in the room right now? Has some some questions we can go through. And since R, we don't have your mom with you. We'll just ask you, your individual feedback about. Yeah. Are you OK with that?  00:25:06 Speaker 2  Uh, yes, I can actually tell her to come in. But.  00:25:08 Speaker 3  OK. Maybe we'll do your portion first and then we'll come back. That sounds good.  00:25:14 Speaker 5  OK, I think I'm going to jump in and start on the questions. R with the feedback so first of all, thank you so much for participating. It was just great to be working with you. And I I really like the way you. I don't know made that made the AI experience personal for yourself. So was it easy or difficult for you to use your AI? Why don't you give us a one to five scale? You know where one is super easy and five is super difficult.  00:25:36 Speaker 2  Yeah. Well, maybe it's not a two because like I started with Gemini, she's kind of giving me some vague answers. You know, uh, well, it was Alexa kind of hit or miss. But Gemini is more good amount of detail, but Alexa is kind of. Rod is good for something. It's like shopping list. Wake up and like give her my, like tell me. Oh, I got PT in 45 minutes. She'll give. Remind me of stuff like that. But Shannon is more deeper answers. So I like the difference between those two.  00:26:32 Speaker 5  OK, so it sounds. Like. They are different for they're. Good for different reasons that.OK. And it was fairly easy for you to learn how?  00:26:39 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  00:26:42 Speaker 5  To use it.  00:26:45 Speaker 2  And yes cause. A big portion of our our life right now is getting digital. So it's like need to get with it.  00:26:53 Speaker 5  OK, what specific problems did you have with Jim and I, for instance, specific problems with like vocabulary. Did I understand your questions? Does she understand your? I'll call is she. Does she understand language? Was it? And if you did have problems, was it easy? To fix the problems.  00:27:14 Speaker 2  I think it was easy to fix like when I gave follow up questions about like you're talking about the the surf contest earlier where well about like the long board at the open and just like she probably in her little computer brain. I just asked about that. So she knows how to refer back to it.   , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  The provided text discusses the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them.\n\nThe text describes each heading of a SOAP note:\n\n1. Subjective - This section includes the patient's personal views or feelings about their health status, as well as the context for the Assessment and Plan. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including therapy needed (medications), specialist referral(s) or consults, and patient education and counseling.\n\nThe text also mentions issues of concern, such as the order in which a medical note is written and the ability to document changes over time. It also discusses the clinical significance of SOAP notes in today's electronic documentation environment.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-15-2024 (Week 5) M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Clinician\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient R.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Clinician\nSpeaker 11: Clinician\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 12: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver\nSpeaker 13: Clinician\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:02 Speaker 1\nPerfect. I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  The conversation appears to be about the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Introduction: SOAP notes are a structured way for healthcare workers to document patient information, helping guide clinical reasoning and decision-making. The structure includes four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n2. Subjective: This section includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The CC is the reason for the visit, while the HPI provides context about the patient's symptoms. The HPI can be organized using the acronym OLDCARTS: Onset, Location, Duration, Characterization, Alleviating and Aggravating factors, Radiation, Temporal factor, and Severity.\n\n3. Objective: This section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data. It's important to distinguish between symptoms (subjective) and signs (objective).\n\n4. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\n5. Plan: This section details additional testing, consultant referrals, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed to address the patient's illnesses.\n\n6. Issues of Concern: While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it can be beneficial to rearrange the order for more efficient communication. However, the original order remains important as it provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. A weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time, and extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: MA, Speaker 3 MA\u2019s mom, Speaker 4 Gemini, Speaker 5  RT, Speaker 6    Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  There we go.  00:00:04 Speaker 2  Thank you. Alright. So M, tell me how how is it going? Have you tried using Gemini at?  All like this past week.  00:00:16 Speaker 3  Yeah, me and my mom each on Tuesday. And she asked me to use general find out what we're looking at. And I asked Gemma what we were looking at.  00:00:29 Speaker 2  Sorry, where were you at but. Did you go somewhere you said?  00:00:32 Speaker 3  Alicia Alicia beach.  00:00:35 Speaker 2  Ohh OK oh, that was that was the week before, is that correct?  00:00:39 Speaker 4  Yeah, as well as this.  00:00:41 Speaker 2  Week oh, this week too. OK, OK, so that was new.  00:00:45 Speaker 4  I'm still on summer break for a week, so we've been. Going to the beach at. Least weekly.  00:00:49 Speaker 2  That's nice. OK. OK, I got it. So then how was it different from the first time?  00:00:58 Speaker 3  Well. Ask Gemini might to somewhere we're looking at and we're on live. It looks like you guys are at the beach. And then.  You said, do you guys, are you guys having fun? I said, yeah.  00:01:15 Speaker 4  She asked if we're having fun the first week that we asked her. She did not ask that the second week did say it looks like you're at the beach.  00:01:27 Speaker 2  Got it. OK. Did it say anything about the weather or what's in the environment or nothing, just about just that you you are you are at the beach, that's all?  00:01:40 Speaker 3  Yeah, just.  00:01:40 Speaker 4  And it. Yeah. And it also like it picked up the legs. I think it picked up M's legs because he was holding the phone. And so it said it in the four ground, it shows feet or leg, something along those lines as those. And also it it took him the whole view of what it seemed. We were trying to compare it or I was trying to compare it to an app called be my eyes which is an app that the blind community uses and you can hold up your phone with be my eyes on it or you can use it through your glasses and it will. Be my eyes is where you can call a volunteer and they will describe what's going on around. A person. So I'm just trying to compare it to different things on the yeah.  00:02:38 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's interesting. OK, alright. OK. So would you say that that was a better fit when you wanted to sort of see something or ask about information about any picture or anything that's like live in front of him?  00:02:59 Speaker 4  I'd say the live is really good to be honest with you. The other thing we used it for, remember in the car when we were driving.  M's dad is from Australia. He was telling M a story about a ship that was a boat that was shipwrecked in like the 70s. And so we asked Gemini what boat was shipped wrecked in Brisbane, Australia. In the 70s and within seconds. It came back with the name and blah blah blah and my husband's going. That's exactly right. And he was some obscure thing that happened in the 70s that really didn't make worldwide news.  00:03:47 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah. So it's really digging information from. Like even the so much so many years back. So which is which is great and it's A and and the good part is that it.  Was accurate, yes.  00:04:00 Speaker 4  Yeah, it was. It was. It was for an obscure fact. It was. You know, like when was World War 2?  00:04:08 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah, OK. Well, nice. That's that's very good to know. OK, I'm gonna share my screen so we can. Get on with this. So this is going to be a little different from last year. We're just gonna do a final review where so we're just gonna review each week's learnings and then I'll provide you with an like an open-ended prompt for any like that particular topic. Of the week. And then we'll. Both of us together, M or even Mom, we can come up with two voice commands per topic and practice those using either Alexa, Gemini or even for you. Your glasses, whichever is is the best fit based on the command that you want to or the activity that you want to practice. OK, alright. So. So let's see where we we start here. So this is information seeking that was the first topic that we discussed and the topics that were covered during that week was about asking about the weather making and. Deleting to do lists, adding events to a calendar, local, asking about local and international news. And information related to sporting events or any kind of other information that you're curious about, you could ask. Those are sort of like the broad topics that we covered for information seeking that week. So let's find 2 tasks that you would like to practice. Related to information seeking and practice, those using either Gemini, your glasses, or Alexa. So let's see what you pick and then we'll decide based on that. If if that makes sense.  00:06:09 Speaker 4  What would you like to do, M?  00:06:12 Speaker 3  When is it going to rain next?  00:06:14 Speaker 4  OK, so to ask about the weather, which. Platform do you think would be better germini. OK, just let me open my phone.  00:06:33 Speaker 2  Are you asking about the weather in your area or is there somewhere you're going or you're curious about?  00:06:42 Speaker 4  Local or do you want to find out where your sister's at?  00:06:45 Speaker 3  State weather.  00:06:49 Speaker 4  OK, go with this. I'll turn the volume up high so she can hear. OK, you ready?  00:06:58 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemina.  00:06:59 Speaker 3  What is the local state weather?  00:07:05 Speaker 5  In state it's 83 and sunny today it'll be sunny with a high of 86 and.  A low of 60.  00:07:12 Speaker 3  Is it going? To rain this soon.  00:07:16 Speaker 5  Currently, there's no chance of rain.  00:07:20 Speaker 3  That makes sense.  00:07:23 Speaker 2  OK, very good.  00:07:24 Speaker 5  OK, you'd like to know if it's.  00:07:29 Speaker 2  That's perfect. OK. All right, what did you? Is that very where your sister lives or what did you say?  00:07:37 Speaker 4  Did so I asked if M wanted to ask where his sisters cause his sister is in Africa, right? Now. Ohh. I at. If you want to ask what the.  Weather where she's at.  00:07:48 Speaker 2  OK, OK, got it. Got it. OK, that was really good. M, I think you did a great job and I think it picked up your command really easily and it it seems like it provided the appropriate weather conditions and everything and also chances of rain. So that's that's great.  Good job asking a follow-up question, M, that was very good. Yeah, alright, let's find another task that or another task or activity related to information seeking that you would like to ask.  00:08:23 Speaker 4  You know what you want to ask?  00:08:25 Speaker 3  Gemini, what's your favorite color?  00:08:26 Speaker 4  No, no, no. Let's not do favorite color. Let's think information setting or something in the world, something global, something.  00:08:36 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemini. What's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:39 Speaker 4  No, it's tap the phone.  00:08:45 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemma, what's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:49 Speaker 5  Africa is a big place, so the weather varies a lot. It could be hot and dry in the Sahara or warm and humid in the.  Congo do. Have a specific country or city in mind.  00:08:58 Speaker 3  Tanzania.  00:09:02 Speaker 5  OK, in Tanzania it's currently 71\u00b0 and partly cloudy. It's going to be mostly sunny with a high of 82 and a low of 69\u00b0.  00:09:12 Speaker 3  About Kenya.  00:09:17 Speaker 5  OK, in Nairobi, Kenya, it's currently 55\u00b0 and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 77\u00b0 and the low is 54\u00b0.  00:09:27 Speaker 3  In Uganda.  00:09:32 Speaker 5  OK. In Kampala, Uganda it's currently 64\u00b0 and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 81\u00b0 and the low is 63\u00b0.  00:09:43 Speaker 2  That's great.  00:09:44 Speaker 3  581 in the low 64.  00:09:45 Speaker 4  Yeah, those are the three places his sister is. Going to be.  00:09:50 Speaker 2  OK. That makes sense. OK, way. To go like with asking all those. Follow-ups, M again, great job.  00:09:57 Speaker 3  Thank you.  00:09:58 Speaker 2  OK. So that I think the live is working much better when whenever he's using Gemini. I guess when in the first session when we are trying to do the weather related questions it was. It was not taking the place. Remember the location and then we had to sort of say the location I think doing live makes like I think it it catches the location on its own or something.  00:10:27 Speaker 4  I agree, and I think live for M especially is a lot easier because when you're not on live, you have to touch the button at the bottom, the microphone and then if you want to stop, you have to find the stop button at the top of the phone. And when you use voiceover, you can do that, but you have to go through it will read every single section.  00:10:54 Speaker 2  Yeah, right.  00:10:57 Speaker 4  Live you just touch the screen anywhere and away you go. Touch the screen again. And it stops.  00:11:03 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's that is really good, I think, yeah, I I I'm glad we found that and found it really quick early on in the training.  00:11:11 Speaker 2  So that has helped a lot. I feel alright, so move on.  00:11:16 Speaker 4  And M can also ask S you know who else is to open up that app and then go to live and it it will just do.  00:11:26 Speaker 2  It OK. Alright, so that's even better because if no one's around you, he could always do that, right, M? Like you can ask. Your phone phones assistant starting with us and and just say that open or like start live on on Gemini or something.  00:11:45 Speaker 3  Yeah. OK.  00:11:48 Speaker 2  OK. So M, the next topic we or we talked about was entertainment. This was I think on one of the Tuesdays that you were not not here and you were at your therapy session. So from last year you might remember that we talked about the different topics under entertainment. It was related to searching information related to media, listening to music, watching movie. These with Gemini and AI tools you can also generate stories and generate any content like generate new content and new stories and you can also tell jokes and play trivia games like you were able to on Alexa. So if you. Were to do. Two tasks related to entertainment. What would you pick?  00:12:41 Speaker 3  Or task. Who made V for Vendetta the movie? 00:12:45 Speaker 2  OK. All right, so UM and what would you, which platform would you use? Which tool you would use for that? It could be your glasses or Gemini or even Alexa or your phones assistant.  00:13:06 Speaker 3  Wanna ask Gemini?  00:13:07  Speaker 2 OK. All right, let's try.  00:13:10 Speaker 4  Go ahead.  00:13:11 Speaker 3  Hey Gemini, who made the V for Vendetta movie?  00:13:17 Speaker 5  V for Vendetta was directed by James Mcteigue of the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis, who were famous for the Matrix movies.  00:13:27 Speaker 2  Is that correct, M?  00:13:28 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:13:29 Speaker 2 OK. Alright,  00:13:31 Speaker 4  M, what do you use on a multiple times during the day with your glasses? What do you ask your glasses? No, you don't. What do you do multiple times and I have to ask you to please stop. No play. No. Player. And play his music multiple times, OK, He uses his glasses a lot to play his music because it will play music from.  00:14:05 Speaker 3  Apple music.  00:14:06 Speaker 4  Apple music or from Amazon? It'll he has to.  00:14:10 Speaker 2  Tell it. OK. Alright. Do you want to try using one of those commands and see? So when you when you use that command does it that will directly come via your earphones of the of your glasses, correct?  00:14:24 Speaker 3  Yeah, yeah.  00:14:25 Speaker 2  OK, alright. We can try that, that works. OK. Whenever you're ready and whatever music you want to play.  00:14:37 Speaker 4  What do you want to listen to?  00:14:39 Speaker 3  It's on my phone.  00:14:40 Speaker 4  OK. Can you say the command? Is it playing the music automatically? It's playing the music automatically.  00:14:50 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:14:54 Speaker 2  OK, so without even.  00:14:56 Speaker 4  Playing sometimes M will say he'll think of a song that he would like to hear, so he'll say, play whatever by whoever, and the glasses, we'll just play it. Or sometimes we could be in a store. And you know how they play music in the stores? He can say, hey, may that what song is playing? And it'll Maida will come back and tell him the name and author of whatever song is playing in the store.  00:15:26 Speaker 2  OK, got it. So right now I think it just heard us talking about playing music and even M confirming that he wanted to play music and then it just started playing music. Yes, OK.  00:15:40 Speaker 4  Yes  00:15:40 Speaker 2  Got it. OK.  00:15:40 Speaker 4  Your music off.  00:15:43 Speaker 2  Alright, M can. You try changing a song or giving it another command which which might help us kind of see how it how. It works  00:15:52 Speaker 4  for something specific.  00:15:54 Speaker 3  10 minutes. Played double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:05 Speaker 2  Is that working?  00:16:07 Speaker 3  Yeah 00:16:08 Speaker 4  It just said here's double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:11 Speaker 2  And So what is the default when it comes to playing music? So right now, like M, you did not specify that you're wanting to play on Amazon Music or, you know, something else or Apple music or anything. So how does it just take?  00:16:32 Speaker 2  Any of those uhm, platforms? Or does it ask you?  00:16:37 Speaker 3  Dad, who's double up by Nipsey Hussle from Apple Music.  00:16:42 Speaker 4  So that must be the default. It goes straight to is that Apple music?  00:16:46 Speaker 2  Apple Music, OK make sense 00:16:48 Speaker 4  We do have that in. A play list on your phone and it was already on his phone too.  00:16:53 Speaker 2  Got it, OK, alright, makes sense. M, that's pretty good. Anything else you'd like to? Do you using Gemini especially because I know you were not here during this particular topic training, so I wanted to see. Like if you wanted to generate a story or I. I don't know if you've ever used to generate content like that and if you were interested in doing that with Gemini. So you wanted to like, you know, listen to a story specifically on, you know, your favorite. Animals or like you know, something like like, you know anything it could be or it could be like a day at the beach or, you know, something some of your favorite action movies or something. And you could try using that and see. If you give it a few details, and if it would come up with a story for you.  00:17:57 Speaker 3  OK.  00:17:59 Speaker 2  So you want to tell us what you want to listen to 1st and then maybe once you know that life starts and you can say it.  00:18:07 Speaker 3  Match. Him or her to give me a short story about V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:13 Speaker 2  OK. Yeah.  00:18:18 Speaker 3  Can you create a short story? Short story for me from the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:27 Speaker 5  In a dystopian London, a masked vigilante named V fights against a totalitarian regime. He rescues a young woman named Evie and introduces her to his world of revolution as they work together, Evie learns about these past and his plans to ignite a rebellion against the oppressive government. In the end, these actions inspired the.  00:18:48 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:18:49 Speaker 4  Is that good? Is that?  00:18:50 Speaker 3  Yep.  00:18:51 Speaker 4  What the movie was about.  00:18:52 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:18:53 Speaker 2  Is that is that the only information that came up or was it like very long?  00:18:58 Speaker 4  I have to go back. Just give me a SEC.  00:19:01 Speaker 2  Oh, OK, OK. I was just curious.  00:19:11 Speaker 4  No, it was quite short. If you can see that.  00:19:16 Speaker 2  Yeah. Ohh OK, that's pretty short. Yeah, so. It's like a few sentences, like maybe like 3 to 4 sentences which.  00:19:25 Speaker 4  Yeah, I'd say 3 UM, maybe about 5.  00:19:28 Speaker 2  Five sentences. OK, alright, that's not too bad. It's definitely like much better than like, you know, asking for news that time and it like giving a bunch of information instead of like just, you know, trying to give you the gist of it. And this seems like almost. A gist or the summary of of the of the entire movie or the, you know, just the plot of the movie. Which which makes sense, but that's great. So M, you can always use these AI tools even here. I think your glasses might be a good option when you have a question like that. Or maybe you wanted synopsis. Of a book. Or you know that you'd like to read or a movie or anything. A. A series that you were kind of interested to learn about and it would give you the details about it, you know, so that you could, you could probably decide based on that whether you want to see something or listen to something or and or not, you know.  00:20:27 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:20:27 Speaker 2  Yeah, that would. Be nice. All right, so moving on the the third week or the third session was self-care and medical needs. So we here we discussed topics related to medication management, creating medication lists and finding medications. Searching for self-care tips such as laundry or caring for a loved ones or loved ones or pets, and we asked a bunch of questions about about your pet. The last time. And tips to improve mental and physical health and searching for home remedies if you if you needed something. So now based on these topics, let's find 2 activities again related to self-care and medical needs and then we can practice those. And we'll, we'll base it on which tool or platform to use based on what you want to practice.  00:21:27 Speaker 4  Gemini. OK. And what are you going to ask?  00:21:30 Speaker 3  Right from my head.  00:21:31 Speaker 4  Ohh. Could you say it louder so they can hear you?  00:21:32 Speaker 3  What's that? How do I comb my hair?  00:21:40 Speaker 4  Yeah.  00:21:41 Speaker 3  How do I comb my hair?  00:21:46 Speaker 5  Well, there are a few ways to approach it. You could start by figuring out what kind of style you're going for. Do you want something classic trendy. Or maybe a bit edgy.  00:21:55 Speaker 3  Trendy.  00:21:59 Speaker 5  OK, for something trendy you could try a textured crop with a matte finish. Or if you have longer hair, a messy Cliff might work. Do either of those sound like something? You'd like to try.  00:22:08 Speaker 3  What's a messy quote?  00:22:12 Speaker 5  A messy quiff is a hairstyle that's shorter on the sides and back, but with longer hair on top that's styled upwards and slightly messy, it's a pretty popular. Look right now.  00:22:25 Speaker 5  You're welcome. Do you need help finding a? Good Barber or salon?  00:22:28 Speaker 3  No thanks.  00:22:32 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's great. OK, I wonder that was that was really good back and forth conversation, I think and things that are that are that are that are most amazing I feel and those are the differences between using like like. Versus, you know, Gemini is you know, even if there's hesitations or interruptions, when a command is being presented to to that tool, it still picks up. It doesn't. It's not very quick to say, oh, I did not understand. So the the speech recognition is so much better. You think like that and?It it leads to less frustration.  00:23:17 Speaker 4  And it's more social, yeah.  00:23:19 Speaker 2  Yes, for sure. Definitely more social because it it's asking good follow up questions too, like for example right now with the Barber and you know finding something and just the back and forth it, it feels more human too and less robotic so.  00:23:37 Speaker 4  I. Have. I've noticed that the a device. Is the has slowly getting a little bit more personable as well as, for example, tonight M asked her to set a timer and before she did she said good evening M. I'll set a timer for 10 minutes or whatever. There it was.  00:24:01 Speaker 2  That's good. OK. Yeah. So it's it's definitely it's getting into those greetings and a little bit of personalization based on who's talking to it instead of like just you know generally answering like it would. So yeah, that makes sense. OK, Alright, M, what would be the next? A second task for you related to self-care and medical needs.   00:24:28 Speaker 3  Say, hey, Gemini, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:35 Speaker 4  You want that one, it wants a.  00:24:35 Speaker 3 Yeah. Hey, Gemma, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:45 Speaker 5  OK, here's how to put gel in your hair. Start with a small amount about a pea size drop and rub it between your palms. Apply it evenly, working from the roots to the ends. Style is desired and add more gel if needed.  00:24:57 Speaker 3  Thanks. I'll do that, Gemini. 00:25:03 Speaker 2  That's good. OK.  00:25:04 Speaker 5  OK, work tips on styling it.  00:25:06 Speaker 3  Thank you. I will.  00:25:10 Speaker 2 OK, alright, perfect. OK, so the next one next topic was meal preparation and cooking. Again that one was when on one of the on past Tuesday actually when you were not around. So we can probably practice some of the commands from maybe last year you remember how we talked about making shopping lists. By adding or viewing or listing the items that were on the list on the shopping list and then removing items, we could find recipes or find recipes related to some certain dietary restrictions. Whether it could be gluten free or vegan, or another one of the dietary restrictions that some people might. Have finding nutritional facts about different foods, for example, number of grams of sugar or sodium in a particular food item. Finding calories in some some kind of food. Finding the ingredients for cooking a specific food and then following the recipe. Like instruction by instruction or step by step.So based on all of those ideas, let's find 2 activities related to meal preparation. Before you do, I wanted to ask you, is there particularly anything that has changed from the past year that you've been contributing more towards when it comes to meal preparation, is there, are there things that have changed while you were in the kitchen with your parents or you know, while you were helping them prep?  00:26:53 Speaker 3  Yeah. Well, I came home from the army and they weren't. Me. So that's a big change.  00:27:02 Speaker 4  M, what about when going to Costco? What have you been doing more of? Putting the list on what?  00:27:12 Speaker 3  Hey.  00:27:12 Speaker 4  Yes, he's been making that list for us on and then when we're at, for example, Costco. Because it comes with glasses, he will just say I'll say them. Here's, you know, the strawberries, the bananas, and he'll tell her. Check off strawberries. Check off bananas. That kind of thing.  00:27:33 Speaker 2  OK, so mainly managing making and managing lists for for shopping is something that you do. And I think A is a perfect solution when it comes to something like that or even even the phones assistant S would do a better job, I guess because it would directly put on the notes section and make a list there. So that makes sense. So let do you think you want to try? Making a list or like is there something that you want to add to your shopping list that we could we could practice now? Or is there something else that you would like to do?  00:28:13 Speaker 4  To grab the. M, is it? Do you want to make a? List. Or do you want to get something different?  00:28:17 Speaker 3  Yeah, I would like to make. A list. Should I go to Alexa?  00:28:23 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, you can. I think your mom's just getting Alexa.  00:28:30 Speaker 3  Sure.  00:28:32 Speaker 2  Uh. Your iPad. OK, yeah.  00:28:34 Speaker 4  M's phone is having some major technical difficulties. Ohh on the side has broken off so. We're waiting kind of for his sister to get back so I can change the plan and the phones and everything. One of those things.  00:28:54 Speaker 2  Too many things when there's too so many technologies together at you so.  00:28:59 Speaker 4  You gotta get older. You'll understand my pain.  00:29:03 Speaker 2  No, I don't. I know.  00:29:06 Speaker 4  OK, M, it's ready.  00:29:09 Speaker 3  Yeah, Alexa.Add marshmallows to my Costco list.  00:29:17 Alexa  Marshmallows added to Costco.  00:29:20 Speaker 2  OK. So are you are you, are you managing like multiple lists? Because you said Costco lists. So are there like different lists for different places? That you usually manage.  00:29:34 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:29:36 Speaker 4  What's the other one? Not albertson's.  00:29:39 Speaker 3  Albertsons.  00:29:41 Speaker 2  OK. Makes sense?  00:29:46 Speaker 3  Hey, Alexa. Add cookies to my Albertson's list.  00:29:52 Alexa Cookies added to Albertsons.  00:29:54 Speaker 2  OK. Perfect. That's. That's really good. Anything else that you do with respect to meal preparation when you are in the kitchen with your dad or your mom when while they're cooking or before they're start, they start to cook?  00:30:12 Speaker 3  Hey, Alexa. Add pasta to the Albertson's list.  00:30:19 Alexa  The cost?  00:30:22 Speaker 4  What else do you do though, to help you? M sometimes helps with like cutting or that type of thing.  00:30:28 Speaker 2  Oh, OK. Do you have any questions when you when you have to do anything of that sort related to it?  00:30:37 Speaker 3  No, this guy Cesar, who's my OT specialist, got me some gloves. That are pretty nice.  00:30:44 Speaker 2  OK. All right.  00:30:47 Speaker 4  But M sets a lot of timers as well. For meeting you, set a timer for. The pizza, right?  00:30:57 Speaker 2  Right. Like how much like that would tell you how much, how much time you should boil something for or like just steam something for and just put a timer and then OK. Got it, alright, but but that's pretty good like I think. Managing lists was. Yes. Was definitely great. Do you? Do you have anything else that you would would like to find out? Like finding caloric calories in foods or nutritional facts about any food that you'd like to ask? And maybe we could this time try to use Gemini and see see if that works and how that would work because we've not gotten to practice. This part.  00:31:37 Speaker 3  OK.  00:31:38 Speaker 2  OK. What? What question are you going to ask?  00:31:44 Speaker 3  How much sugar is in the cookies I eat?  00:31:47 Speaker 4  What kind of cookies are you talking about? OK, makes you.  00:31:49 Speaker 3  Symptoms.  00:31:54 Speaker 4  On the tape, OK.  00:31:58 Speaker 3  How much sugar is in the Tim Toms?  00:32:04 Speaker 5  I couldn't find how much sugar is in Tim Tams. You might be able to find that information on the nutrition label on the packaging or on the manufacturer's website.  00:32:12 Speaker 3  OK. Thank you. Hey, Gemini. How much sugar is in the Milo? 00:32:21 Speaker 5  OK, according to the official Milo website, a cup of Milo has about 1 teaspoon of added sugar that's on top of the natural sugars from the milk and malt barley. Does that answer your question?  00:32:31 Speaker 3  Yeah, it does. Thank you.  00:32:33 Speaker 2  OK. So that's good. I mean if it doesn't have an answer to any question, then it will just say that you know it, I don't know about that.  00:32:43 Speaker 4  Yeah. And where to find it?  00:32:45 Speaker 2  Yeah. And where to find it? Yeah, that's that's really good. Alright, so that's the end of our review. Let me stop sharing for a minute and then we'll move on to some of the questions. That we have here.  00:33:05 Speaker 2  OK. Alright, so I'm just going to ask. This was also. The last time that we did the training that we just asked questions about how do you find the training? What kind of problems or challenges you faced and justice sharing about the AI in general and the training satisfaction etc. OK so start M with you and Lauren you can chime in anytime you anytime you think you wanted to contribute so. Because these some of these questions I'm starting with are related to AI satisfaction. So was it difficult or easy for you to use your AI? So Gemini or your glasses for that matter, we're gonna take both into consideration since we've used both through the training and you use those, I think you use your glasses a lot during your day-to-day life so. Tell me about it. How easy or difficult you think?  00:34:07 Speaker 3  We're using at my glass store someone just like Dang. Thank you, Gemini.  00:34:09 Speaker 2  OK. OK. So same with Gemini and and your glasses. It's easy for you to use them, OK?  00:34:20 Speaker 4  The glasses and Gemini pick up where? The a device leaves off base. They all have their place. The truly they truly have their own place, but I can see. There are certain activities 1 is better than the other, but if you can't get the answer on one, you can go to another and that's nice. Having that option, yeah, yeah.  00:34:39 Speaker 2  OK. OK, what specific problems have you faced with Gemini? For example, does it have difficulties understanding your speech or does it have have any difficulties understanding your language or or any sort of navigation issues that you've had? The Gemini.  00:35:08 Speaker 3  There's not really any.  00:35:12 Speaker 4  Actually no. And when we're in the car on Tuesday, we asked a question and it could not understand what we were asking. So we had to rework it. I'm trying to think of what that.Question was.  00:35:28 Speaker 3  Me too.  00:35:31 Speaker 4  It had to do with that boat in Australia we had to. I think it was the way the question was worded the first time. It was unable, it gave information, but it was not accurate. It was about something that happened somewhere else in Australia. But when we added.  00:35:49 Speaker 3  Been on the beach.  00:35:51 Speaker 4  Yes, that's right. When we added Brisbane to it, we're a little bit more specific. It gave a more specific answer.  00:35:59 Speaker 2  OK, makes sense. All right, so that, but when it comes to so you have to sometimes tweak your language and the words to make sure that it gives the information that you're looking for.That makes sense. OK, alright.  How about speech? I think, is there any difficulty? Do you do you feel with with respect to your understanding of speech or? For navigation with Gemini, I think ever since you found the live option, but he could go live on Gemini, I think it's it's really good. I guess the navigation has become much easier.  00:36:42 Speaker 4  Yes, it has. But remember, last week when we were on live, I'll say the question and they couldn't answer that question. Remember, I can't remember what it was for. I can't remember what it was, but we were we asked a question on live and it said you have to go. We don't have the capability yet to.  00:37:01 Speaker 2  Oh oh, I think it was like asking us to link it to Google Workspace or something, and it was about the events.  00:37:10 Speaker 4  Something along the side, yeah.  00:37:12 Speaker 2  Yeah, trying to set up events and and. The same happened. What\u2019s that? 00:37:18 Speaker 4  On the calendar, that's right.  00:37:19 Speaker 2  Calendar. Yes, yes, it it. It kind of told that it would not be able to. Yes that that those kind of questions I guess are tests where it's linked to a certain calendar. If it does not have access to it, it's gonna have a hard time linking it or you know that that's going to be. Only there. So when it comes to reminders or scheduling appointments or any of that I guess. The others are much better. Instead of like using AI and and I think you're already doing that and it's it's that's perfect. You know, whatever is working is working and what we don't want to fix, what's not broken you know so it's that's that's good. All right. So that's good. What do you like most about having Gemini, M?  00:38:10 Speaker 3  He understands me. Well.  00:38:13 Speaker 2  Yeah. So the speech recognition part is very good. It's it's a much, I think it's it's much better when it when compared to last last year's training with Alexa, I guess because you know if there were words or names of movies and people or topics or you know or. Something like a proper noun. And I think it was not correctly pronounced. It would not take that like and it would. You know, we had so much reworking always with the commands that we used to do. So that definitely is is really good. And then what do you dislike the most about having Gemini?  00:38:55 Speaker 4  The good thing too is Gemini allows a bit of a pause, a lot of times. Your follow-up question has to be really quick as Gemini allows a little bit more of a pause, allows a little bit more time for that follow up question actually and it allows a little bit more time than M's glasses. Lows.  00:39:16 Speaker 2  Ohh OK, so that's even a difference between those two AI tools. I mean, and in that case, that's great. OK. Yeah, there's definitely. And sometimes if you if if you talk too quickly after you know the after saying the wake word, it still takes that information. And if sometimes you don't say Gemini and you start just talking when you're alive. It still takes up that information. You don't have to every time say that which which I think is, is this really good when it comes to UM? You know, just normal normalizing like a conversation between two humans, like you don't always say the person's name or something, right? So that that. Makes sense. 00:40:04 Speaker 4   A little bit of a sound because M didn't have to ask. Use, say Gemini tonight at all because it makes a little sound. I don't know if you heard the sound, but it's almost like. Like when you turn on the device. You can hear the sound OK. Like a woosh, so to speak, and so he could hear that and then just go from there.  00:40:25 Speaker 2  Right. So you would know that it's it's on and like you can you can talk now and makes sense. Is there anything that you dislike about Gemini about having Gemini?  Speaker 3 No 00:40:38 Speaker 2  No. OK.  00:40:39 Speaker 4  That's the difference between Gemini and a because a just gives you a blue light and it. Cannot see the blue light. You don't know if it's on. Or not, yes. That's the big difference between them. 00:40:53 Speaker 2  That's a big difference. That's right. What would you change to Gemini to? Make it easier to use. Is there anything?  00:41:03 Speaker 3  Voice recognition.  00:41:07 Speaker 4  Well, but it is recognizing your voice.  00:41:10 Speaker 3  Speech recognition.  00:41:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, I I think that's that's why I think speech and word recognition is pretty good when when you're comparing Gemini to a I guess because it it's definitely doing better. But is there anything that you would change to make it? In any. Other aspect like how? It could be anything else too, and you know it doesn't have to be something.  00:41:39 Speaker 4  And I better.  Speaker 3 Speech resolution 00:41:42 Speaker 4  We're not sure if Gemini goes through M's glasses or not, and so if it doesn't, that would be a definite plus because remember, made us doing their own AI. So I don't know that it would go through the glasses.  00:42:00 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah. Because you know the the glasses allow him to add things to the to a. And like, you know, for the shopping list and things like that. So those two can be synched but. Yeah, I'm not sure that might be something to look into if if those if it would allow Gemini or you know some other like ChatGPT or something. But I believe it would not yeah, because you know how Alexa does not allow S or.  00:42:14 Speaker 4  And. I agree.  00:42:34 Speaker 2  This does not allow a like something because those are the parallels like they are competitors almost. So I guess that would be classes allow Surrey.  00:42:42 Speaker 4  Class. Yes, because the glasses no. You need the phone to work because the glass is paired to the phone. So I think that.  00:42:52 Speaker 2  Yeah. And I think the glasses might be also OK with like a regular Google Assistant, but not like an AI powered. You know what I mean? Because it has its own AI, but that's interesting. Maybe it's it's worth checking. Like, I I don't know whether you know it. It it could just surprise us by having. You know, be having the ability to say.  00:43:15 Speaker 4  The glasses are paired with the be my eyes app that is their accessibility feature for the blind, and so that is one thing that they truly are paired with.  00:43:22 Speaker 2  OK. Right, right. OK, that's that's good to know. OK. All right. So in this training we covered. 4 topics. So we did. News and facts, which is information. Entertainment self-care, medical needs and meal preparation. What topic would you continue to use after this training with, with with Gemini especially and why?  00:43:57 Speaker 3  Meal preparation.  00:44:00 Speaker 2  OK. Is there is there a reason why?  00:44:03 Speaker 3  Because. I think my parents would be. Happy I didn't have no preparation.   Speaker 2 Yeah, that for sure, but.  00:44:15 Speaker 4  Personally, forget about us.  00:44:16 Speaker 3  Entertainment.  00:44:20 Speaker 2  Entertainment.  00:44:21 Speaker 3  Entertainment.  00:44:23 Speaker 2  OK. What, what? What specifically in entertainment would you? Use it for.  00:44:31 Speaker 3  And my favorite songs.  00:44:34 Speaker 2  OK. Anything new? Because you're already doing those things right? Like you are playing songs already. Using your glasses. Is there anything new you would do with with with using Gemini and especially related to entertainment?  00:44:53 Speaker 4  Think about learning. Maybe about more about. The different songs or the different actors or? Different movies. Yeah.  00:45:06 Speaker 2  Well, it just.  00:45:08 Speaker 4  He just said, like, what happened to Hulk Hogan? Because, you know, it's all over the news. Right now, yeah.  00:45:13 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. Yeah. So that that makes sense. So like you would you would want to get more information about those you know those those particular movies or series related to entertainment? And maybe generate like synopsis or you know a little summary of the movie or a book or, you know, yeah, that would, that would be great. Alright. So what are your goal? What were your goals before we started this training and have you met them?  00:45:49 Speaker 4  What's your goal? What was one of your goals? Was it to learn more about Gemini or?  00:45:52 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:45:55 Speaker 4  Have you? Do you feel you've met that goal or?  00:45:56 Speaker 3  Yeah, I think here.  00:46:00 Speaker 4  You think you have.  Speaker 2 OK. Yeah 00:46:02 Speaker 4  We were at the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum. On the weekend, M used his glasses a lot there, you know, what am I looking at? You know, you're looking at an Oscar statue by whatever or, you know, the costume that Ryan seek. Was it was it?  00:46:22 Speaker 3  Brian. OK.  00:46:24 Speaker 4  Ryan, whatever the guy that wore the pink suit with the diamonds for Barbie. Yeah, yeah. Bribed that. So he used the glasses a lot for that. To what am I looking at? And he would just getting information about the different things. At the museum.  00:46:40 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. So that's I I think the glasses are such a good. Tool to have, especially when you are traveling and going places just to get more information and and it's portable enough and you don't have to take your phone out each time to sort of you know get, get, get whatever information you need. So that's perfect so. You've definitely gotten better using AI tools within your class. Glasses and anything else?  00:47:15 Speaker 4  That like in the car on the way back from that museum, we, him and I to ask a question about it, was something related to the museum. I honestly can't remember what it was. A friend of Ms was also in the car. With us and had asked a question about one of the shows or things that we saw there. Is it like when was the movie like Casablanca or something like that? I can't remember. What year? So we asked Gemini, remember distinctly. I don't remember what movie present.  00:47:48 Speaker 2  Yeah. No, no, but that's great. OK. And did you pick? Was that your first choice like that? You wanted to ask Gemini and. OK, alright.  00:47:59 Speaker 4  Gemini rather than Google it, we just asked. Gemini, Gemini.  00:48:02 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. Alright. So M, do you have any suggestions for this training program?  00:48:09 Speaker 3  That's Gemini. What your favorite colors.  00:48:13 Speaker 4  M,  Speaker 3 so great guys.  00:48:17 Speaker 4  Forget the color.  00:48:21 Speaker 2  Anything specific that you have like any suggestions you may have for us, uh or in the for the for the training program or how it should be or anything differently that we should do?  00:48:33 Speaker 3  When is Google gonna let you go? When it's going to let you leave.  00:48:41 Speaker 4  What?  00:48:42 Speaker 3  Good job.  00:48:43 Speaker 4  Ohh I say it, the format that you're doing is very good and that doing the breakout rooms is good. The questions, the slides that you have because. If M could see, he would be able to refer back to the slides. I know I was looking at the slides and you would ask a question. So I think it's a very. Good format. 00:49:06 Speaker 2   OK great. OK.  00:49:08 Speaker 4  Kind of the way that you read it out loud for M, it enables him to participate, so. I think. Yeah, you've made it. You've done the training in a way that maintains. M's interest.  00:49:22 Speaker 2  Ohh for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's really nice to know. Alright so. So do you have any questions or feedback about Geminis responses? UM, anything with the responses that went well and any challenges that you encounter with the responses? But ever since we we started like related to Gemini. Yeah. Any responses that you particularly like and those went wrong versus some things that didn't go well.  00:49:58 Speaker 3  Not that I could think of.  00:50:01 Speaker 4  I think the responses that were more personable kept M's interest and then he would. Ask a follow up question. 00:50:09 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah, 00:50:10 Speaker 4  You could just almost see a conversation going back and. Forth, 00:50:13 Speaker 2  back and forth.  00:50:16 Speaker 4  And if it wasn't as personable or gemini, and I wasn't quite understanding what the question was.  00:50:23 Speaker 3  She basically say what?  00:50:24 Speaker 4  It kind of cut, cut the conversation quickly.  00:50:29 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, that was the good part. Definitely. Like how? Especially with the sugar content that you just asked, like, you know, I did not know the answer and it still gave you a good follow up like you know response that ohh you could check here like you know and instead of like just giving a wig and incorrect answer. So that makes sense. What are some of the challenges that you encountered when asking for responses?  00:51:00 Speaker 3  Speech recognition.  00:51:03 Speaker 4  I would guess not responding quick enough. Like not asked.If you weren't quite sure what you were asking. And you start talking and you're not, and you're trying to come up with the correct answer. Yeah, she loses you.  00:51:21 Speaker 2  OK, OK.  00:51:22 Speaker 4  A little bit quicker.  00:51:24 Speaker 2  Be a little bit quicker in terms of responses, OK. Anything else that you can think of when it comes to challenges?  00:51:37 Speaker 3  He understands very much time, but not all the time.  00:51:40 Speaker 2  OK. All right. Can you give me an example of when? She doesn't understand.  00:51:48 Speaker 3  When she doesn\u2019t? 00:51:49 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:51:52 Speaker 4  Did you when you mumble a little bit?  00:51:53 Speaker 3  Now remember, a little bit should be like what did you say?  00:51:56 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:51:58 Speaker 3  I'll clear my my throat and say I said this, that or the third.  00:52:04 Speaker 2  OK. All right. That makes sense. OK. Another this is my personal thing, but I think when we first started. And we did the. Participatory design, especially when we were talking about all the responses, M and you know how you asked about the conflict between Israel and Iran. And it just sort of gave you like so much information at once and that was the thing with all the different AI tools that we tried that day. It was so much more descriptive. So.  00:52:46 Speaker 1  Hi. Claire, are we done with M?  00:52:53 Speaker 6  No, we're still on 3.1.  00:52:55 Speaker 1  Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.  00:52:56 Speaker 6  Yeah. No, you're good. Are you? Yeah.  00:52:59 Speaker 1  Hey, we just want to say bye to M and then we'll probably let her go. Yeah, because we finished early. Sorry about that. OK. Let's see. R, I may just ask you to share with Claire and Peter like one quick comment and then maybe we don't get enough time to show M. If you want to show, show them stuff you work on today as a final. Ohh there. There's. Hi. Sorry for interrupting. I know you 2 are still going. R. Want to say hi before our summer program ends, so I just figured R will show something, and then we'll let you go back to the room again. Yes, interrupting.  00:53:49 Speaker 6  Oh yeah, I was just gonna. I was using Geminni for. They to health they personal health.Like. Like things to do to, like, calm yourself down. So it's like. Like calming yourself, doing music and going outside. And just like she would give me a list of things to do and just doing creative and doing self-care. And I is music soothing does like using Geminis give you these little prompts so you can find. Find they calm or just being. You could see their mind through things like journaling and aromatherapy and just. It's even just petting them or just listening to music and writing it down, so it's like. Do you ever name is the platform I can get all these. It's just like a short list of things you just care for yourself, like doing exercise or like if she wants you. Ohh you can do some aromatherapy and just she just gives you a list of things you can back yourself up with a self-care.  00:55:00 Speaker 4  R is sharing the list of things that Gemini I told her, and she shared her screen showing the different suggestions that Gemini gave her.  00:55:10 Speaker 3  OK. That's nice. Yeah. Share your screen, R.  00:55:15 Speaker 1  And do you want to read maybe one or think one or two things that you may do this summer so M can know your summer rest of your summer plan?  00:55:26 Speaker 6  Ohh like you know. Like like end of next weekend, like coming next couple weeks. You U.S. Open of surfing is in Huntington and we're using temerity to like find parking and they're looking for survey competitions cause we asked asked her about like when will. Like the longboard surf surfing contests happen cause I like surfing longboard cause. I was like, want to watch that cause I'm not that really that great. But I just like watching. So just using Gemini to like give me information about things I like to watch. Just just to for my own summer plans. Yeah.  00:56:11 Speaker 3  Thank you for the information, R.  00:56:14 Speaker 1  M, do you have anything you want to tell R before we let her Go.  00:56:18 Speaker 4  Tell her, UM, what? We asked. Gemini will move in the car. Coming back from the beach.  00:56:24 Speaker 3  Yes, we ask Gemini, we ask Gemini, where we were.  00:56:29 Speaker 4  About the boat in Australia.  00:56:30 Speaker 3  About the boat in Australia. Is it boat that crashed? It crashed on Rainbow Beach and my boss told us about Rainbow Beach because he was from Australia. And the ship crashed in the 80s and the 70s.  00:56:47 Speaker 6  Oh.  00:56:47 Speaker 4  And so Gemini gave an obscure fact that we fall from the 70s when his father lived in Australia.  00:56:56 Speaker 6  It's like, yeah, like a family connection, but it's like. Pam is sometimes history is. Feel you feel like. Some kind of connection, yeah.  00:57:09 Speaker 4  His dad had told him a story and M verified the story with Gemini.  00:57:14 Speaker 6  Using it, it's kinda it's like this really happened. Like OK is it? Gemini knows. Yeah, it was there. So it's like backing information to what your dad told you. She it was a real thing. So you should have my. It's like another. Like another perspective for us, like using our life, yeah.  00:57:36 Speaker 4  Yeah, that's right.  00:57:38 Speaker 1  Thank you so much for sharing M and prayer let you folks go back into. Your room, OK. Yeah. And Kelly and Larry and Arisha and R, you are free to go. Having summer will stay in. Touch.  00:57:50 Speaker 2  Alright, OK.  00:57:52 Speaker 6  OK. Bye bye.  00:57:54 Speaker 1  Everybody had a good summer.  00:57:59 Speaker 3  Thank you you guys too.  00:58:18 Speaker 2  Oh. Oh, Claire's here. That's fine. OK. Alright. So. Oh, yeah. Sorry. M\u2019s momo, I think we were talking about. Wait one SEC. There we go. OK. Yeah. From your perspective, how can we make the AI responses more relevant to? You. That's that's the question you were Discussing 00:58:42 Speaker 4   right and. I remember we were just talking about it and then it. Went off.  00:58:49 Speaker 2  I know, I know. UM.  00:58:57 Speaker 4  To make the AI more relevant. Well, I think Jim and I picks up where maybe the glasses lets off or Alexa lets where the different devices stop. Gemini picks up and it gives. And another opportunity like if you can't get the answer from your phone on just because from my era and I I was new to Google, we would just start Googling everything and now it's almost as if you don't need to Google anymore, you can just. Ask Jim and I and you'll get an instant response. And for M, who grew up with all of the technology. It's so easy for him just to ask his glasses or because he's wearing them most times and he will say. Well, I need my glasses to see and so cause it tells him the information that he needs more so than just asking the phone anymore. If the glasses isn't giving the answer quick enough, he can ask Gemini.  01:00:07 Speaker 2  Yes. OK. So like different tools will give different kind of responses and there were one thought if one thought short something there's another platform to pick up and and try that for asking that particular question. OK. That makes sense. Alright, so any any command examples that you can specifically share when it comes to you know how 11 platform will let let off and then you know some some other platform would pick up. Is there a specific example?  01:00:46 Speaker 4  Think of is the calendar if you ask. On. S on the phone? Yeah. What am I doing today or what's on my calendar? Yeah, might say. Ohh. You have 3 events today.  01:01:01 Speaker 2  MHM.  01:01:02 Speaker 4  And you can say what are the events you have 3 events today, whereas if you ask Alexa, she was. If you have 3 events today at 8:00 you are going to the brain and at 10:00 you have a dental appointment. It will give, it will literally read your calendar to you.  01:01:09 Speaker 2  Correct. 01:01:21 Speaker 4   And then the downfall is Gemini won't go into your calendar unless they have access.  01:01:27 Speaker 2  Yeah. Can you think of something other way around where where AI or Gemini where and the glasses would pick up and and wear Alexa or S would not respond to or not respond appropriately? Are there any topics or or examples like that?  01:01:58 Speaker 4  Well. With the glasses, M can. He's really good. Like with playing a lot of his music and then asking questions about the author who wrote the song, or when did it come out or. Yeah, play something similar to it and it's all linked to his.To the Apple music, right, and which is on this phone whereas. The A Alexa is more linked to. Amazon Music.  01:02:30 Speaker 2  Right.  01:02:35 Speaker 4  And I would guess he we haven't done it, but actually we kind of did it in a roundabout way, asking Jim and I about certain things related to that song. You could get it, and especially like if the if the song is from a movie, for example, when we were at the museum. In Los Angeles last weekend, he could have said what is the theme song from Casablanca? That type of thing, and he would have gotten that from Jim and I and probably got more information from Gemini than from his bosses.  01:03:06 Speaker 2  Got it. OK. OK. Alright. Makes sense. So we're interested in designing the AI response to be more interactive. So imagine like a virtual clinician for you to help you with your needs. So when this training is not on, say you need it. You know, any any anything that you need, like a virtual clinician for what kinds of help would you like to receive from this kind of agent?  01:03:39 Speaker 4  Well, I think what M did tonight when we were doing those examples with his hair, yes. And he asked, like, how do I comb my hair? Because that's one thing. And he asked, I give. I've done my hair properly. Yeah. And he asked that follow up question how do I apply the type of guy and then the hair gel. That was all very relevant. To a 25 year old.  01:04:01 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  01:04:02 Speaker 4  And so I think that was very appropriate. I could see the virtual. I mean they worked with Gemini in doing that, right,  Speaker 2 right, right .  01:04:16 Speaker 4  And More so, like, stuff like that.  01:04:20 Speaker 4 How do I and I would guess you could even say something like how do I brush my teeth to make sure I clean? Them all or .   01:04:28 Speaker 2  yeahYeah. So would you say that when it comes to like a virtual agent or a virtual clinician, it would be more of providing ideas of what kind of questions and what kind of content he could ask for so that the? He could use the platforms or the tools to the fullest. Of its ability.  01:04:51 Speaker 4  I think so, yeah. Because I think the biggest difference is M has a TBI and so. And me being older and so I'm having to try to figure it out. Compared to someone like Peter, for example, who is closer in age to M, who doesn't have a TBI, I'm sure he just can come up with stuff like. This whereas M starting to get back to that type of way, whereas me it's a whole new learning experience.  01:05:24 Speaker 2  Right. Correct, correct. OK, alright. That makes so much sense. Thank you for sharing that. OK so. UM, what information do you want to share with this kind of virtual agent, or what information do you want the agent to learn so that it could help you with the homework or with the training of the of this training?  01:05:54 Speaker 4  I think the more you use the AI, the more the AI learns about you. So, for instance, with M's glasses, he can ask a question like.  01:06:07 Speaker 3  I'm blind.  01:06:08 Speaker 4  Hey Maida, what am I looking at? And Maida will give a description. And M can say remember Mata, I'm blind and my Maida will then give a more comprehensive description as yeah, he's looking at. And so the AI responds to that. When you say, remember, I'm blind or I am blind. What am I looking at? Yeah, I am blind. Is it safe to cross the street?That's not a good example because they won't. No AI will tell you it's safe to cross the street. That's a safety issue, but it might say, are there any cars in the vicinity? Yes. She's fine.  01:06:50 Speaker 3  See.  01:06:50 Speaker 4  Yeah, she's right there. She's OK. She was asking about the dog, but I think. Yeah. So no way I will tell you. Yes, you can cross the street, but they can tell you if you stay on. Remember, I'm blind. What is on the sign above me? It will read the sign more detail. 01:07:08 Speaker 2  Yeah. And it's almost like it. You want to learn your own history and your own like to remember the facts about about yourself and and then respond appropriately, you know.  01:07:26 Speaker 4  Yes, definitely. M saying the dog.  01:07:28 Speaker 2  Up. Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, I'm almost. I I should be done. I guess so.  01:07:34 Speaker 4  It's just.  01:07:38 Speaker 2  What what would be ideal interaction between between M and the agent? So a a virtual agent like that who would be helping with, you know, maintaining their learnings from this kind of training?  01:07:55 Speaker 4  Ohh, I noticed that when M uses Gemini. He would say things like thank you and Gemini responds back. You're welcome, that type of thing and it's more conversational and and even with follow up questions on both ways, whether it's from M or from the agent when they were asking about. The weather in Africa. And M said, well, how's about in, you know, Tanzania? He went to the different places assistant, and then she, he said thank you. She said you're welcome that makes a. Difference I think because it's just part of a typical conversation, because even with Alexa, he'll say, oh, thank you, Alexa. And there's no response. Siri responds back. But. Does Maida respond back to you, Maida?  01:08:47 Speaker 3  Nope.  01:08:48 Speaker 2  Doesn't does not OK.  01:08:51 Speaker 4  Sorry does but Alexa and the glasses don't say, oh, you're. Welcome. 01:08:55 Speaker 2  Yeah. And I think the other difference when he was asking about the weather, he he asked, what's the weather in, you know, Tanzania and then? For for the other two locations, he did not see. The whole question. It was like, how about in, you know, Uganda? Or how about in Kenya? So it doesn't even like it remembers like it contextually remembers what the context was and what he was asking. In the question. Previously and then kind of repeats and makes up the context on its own which which which is different from how a? Or S would be in this. Given situation.  01:09:36 Speaker 4  And with the person with the TBI. That's a lot easier because having to remember a big long prompt, yeah, a lot different than being able to have it, more like a conversation.  01:09:49 Speaker 2  Exactly. Yes. All right. Well, that that really that this it actually. Yeah. Is there anything else you would like to share with us?  Speaker 3 Nope Speaker 2 He's he's like I'm done. Can you can you just, like, be done now? I'm. I'm just so done right, M.  01:10:08 Speaker 1  M, I just want to say thank you so much for another great summer. You taught us so much about AI.  01:10:14 Speaker 2  I feel yes the same way I think and you've done so well since the past year. I think I see huge, huge. I mean I think gains in your skills and your language and your speech especially I think it's. It's really wonderful.  01:10:31 Speaker 4  What do you say, M?  01:10:32 Speaker 3  Thank you.  01:10:35 Speaker 1  And thank you so much for everything you're doing to support her mom. And we cannot do this without you every summer. And we love seeing you all making really great explorations and trying out new things with us and learning from these new available free tools. And yeah, it's been great. Summer. Is there anything like I'll. I'll follow up on the gift card. Got your e-mail and they'll probably do it in waves. And is there anything else you'd like us to follow up with or if you're interested in maybe doing more of the lessons in the fall and spring semester we're planning and thinking about that because we have a few people on the.  01:11:16 Speaker 4  Just in mind, because we're learning a lot from it as well. I mean, truthfully, Alexa has been a godsend for M because it's making him more independent. All of these different technologies and the AI, it is helping M become more independent and it's helping us. It's kind of. Think outside the box as well, and that's been wonderful. So we've truly appreciate. Every time you've offered to us, we really do.  01:11:44 Speaker 1  Thank you. M, we're all done. We'll let you go eat your dinner. Thank you so much for being very patient. With us, bye.  01:11:52 Speaker 4  Thank you so much. We appreciate all your help. Thank you. Bye bye.        \nWEBVTT   00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:13.963 Thank you. All right. Um, so Michael, tell me how\u2026 how is it going? Have you tried using Gemini at all? Like, this.  00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:19.784 Past week\u2026 Yeah.  00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.442 Yeah. Me and my mom are on the beach on Tuesday.  00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:25.522 And she asked me to use Gemini to find out what we were looking at.  00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.359 Sorry, where were you at? Did you go somewhere, you said?  00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:31.973 And I asked Gemini what we were looking at.  00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.945 Oh, okay. Oh, that was\u2026 that was the week before, is that correct?  00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970 Alessio Beach.  00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.465 Yeah. As well as this week.  00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360 I'm still on summer break for a week, so we've been going to the beach at least weekly.  00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.951 Oh, this week too, okay, okay. So that was new, um\u2026  00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:57.477 That's nice. Okay, okay, I got it. Um, so then\u2026 Um, how was it different from the first time?  00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:08.154 Ask Gemini to tell me what we're looking at. And we're on live. She said it looks like you guys are at the beach.  00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:13.396 And then\u2026 You said\u2026 do you guys\u2026 are you guys having fun?  00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:20.021 I said, yeah. She asked if we're having fun the first week that we asked her.  00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.770 Okay. Okay, okay.  00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:26.844 She did not ask that the second week. Did say it looks like you're at the beach.  00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.840 Got it, okay. Did it say anything about the weather, or what's in the environment, or\u2026 nothing, just about\u2026 just that.  00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.750 We were\u2026  00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710 You are at the beach, that's all.  00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:57.963 Yeah, and it also, like, it picked up, um\u2026 the legs, uh, I think it picked up Michael's legs, because he was holding the phone, and so it said it in the four\u2026 ground, it shows the, um, feet or legs, something along those lines, as well.  00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150 Uh-huh.  00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:02.216 And also, it\u2026 it took in the whole view of what it seemed.  00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.014 Got it.  00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.829 We were trying to compare it, or I was trying to compare it to an app called Be My Eyes.  00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.141 Mmm\u2026  00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.740 Which is, um\u2026 amount that the blind community uses.  00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:15.674 Okay.  00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:21.389 Okay? Uh-huh.  00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790 And you can hold up your phone with be my eyes on it.  00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:33.660 Or you can use it through your glasses. And it will be my eyes is where you can call a\u2026 volunteer, and they will describe what's going on around you. So it's a good person.  00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:37.811 So, I was just trying to compare it to different things on the phone.  00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:37.664 What's going on? Okay.  00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:57.583 Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting, okay. All right, okay. So, would you say that that was a better fit when you wanted to\u2026 sort of see something, um, or ask\u2026 about information about any picture or anything that's, like, live in front of him?  00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:02.644 I'd say live is really good, to be honest with you.  00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:07.503 Um, the other thing we used it for, remember in the car when we were driving?  00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.085 Okay.  00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:16.089 Michael's dad is from Australia. He was telling Michael a story about a ship.  00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:16.942 Oh?  00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:20.672 That was a boat that was shipwrecked in, like, the 70s.  00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:30.241 And so, we asked Gemini. What boat was shipwrecked in Brisbane, Australia in the 70s?  00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.802 Okay.  00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:38.627 And within seconds. It came back with the name and blah blah blah, and my husband's going, that's exactly right.  00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:44.204 And it was some obscure thing that happened in the 70s.  00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.729 Oh, okay.  00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.069 Great. Yeah, yeah, so it's really digging information from.  00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.280 That really didn't make worldwide news.  00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:59.934 Like, even the\u2026 so much, so many years back, so which is\u2026 which is great. And it's a\u2026 and the good part is that it was accurate.  00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:08.849 Yes. And it was\u2026 it was\u2026 it was for an obscure fact. It wasn't\u2026 you know, like, when was World War II?  00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.776 Yeah.  00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:14.285 Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, nice, that's\u2026 that's very good to know. Okay, I'm gonna share my screen.  00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:26.526 So, we can, um\u2026 get on with this. Um, so this is going to be a little different from last year. We're just gonna do a final review.  00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:39.654 Where, um, so we're just gonna review each week's learnings, and then\u2026 Um, I'll provide you with, like, an open-ended prompt for any, like, that particular topic of the week.  00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:54.649 And then we'll, um\u2026 both of us together, Michael, or even Mom, uh, we can come up with, um, two voice commands per topic and practice those using either Alexa, Gemini, or even for you, your glasses.  00:04:54.925 --> 00:05:02.925 Whichever is the best fit. Um\u2026 based on the command that you want to, or the activity that you want to practice.  00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:17.924 Okay? Alright, so\u2026 Um\u2026 So, let's see where we\u2026 we start here. Um, so this is information seeking. That was the first topic that we discussed.  00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:09.137 Okay.  00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:25.391 And, um, the topics that were covered during that week was about asking about the weather.  00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:35.542 Making and, uh, deleting to-do lists. Um, adding events to a calendar, local, uh, asking about local and international news.  00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:43.551 Um, and information related to sporting events, or any kind of other information that you're curious about, you could ask.  00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:47.508 Those are sort of, like, the broad topics that we covered.  00:05:47.575 --> 00:06:00.575 For information seeking that week. So, let's find two tasks that you would like to, um\u2026 practice related to information seeking, and practice those using either Gemini.  00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:07.528 Um, your glasses or Alexa. So, let's see, what you pick, and then we'll decide based on that.  00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:14.677 What would you like to do, Michael? When's it gonna rain next?  00:06:11.664 --> 00:06:13.664 If that makes sense.  00:06:14.344 --> 00:06:21.344 Okay, so to ask about the weather, which, um\u2026 What platform do you think would be better? Gemini.  00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.611 Gemini? Okay, just let me open my phone.  00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:40.977 Are you asking about the weather, um, in your area, or is there somewhere you're going, or you're curious about?  00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.630 Local, or do you want to find out where your sister's at?  00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:54.714 State weather. Okay. Okay, um\u2026 go like this, I'll turn the volume up high so she can hear.  00:06:55.135 --> 00:07:02.135 Okay, you ready? Yeah. Hey, Gemini. What is the local state weather?  00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:10.995 In state, it's 83 and sunny. Today, it'll be sunny, with a high of 86 and a low of 60.  00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:18.658 Is it gonna rain soon? Currently, there's no chance of rain.  00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:26.851 Does that make sense?  00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:29.842 Okay, very good.  00:07:29.356 --> 00:07:38.356 That's perfect, okay. All right. What did you, um\u2026 Is that very\u2026 where your sister lives, or what did you say?  00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.319 You'd like to know if it's going\u2026  00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:44.075 Now, I asked, um, if Micah wanted to ask where his sister is, because his sister is in Africa right now.  00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:55.414 Oh, okay. Oh, okay, okay, got it, got it. Okay, that was really good, Michael. I think you did a great job, and I think it picked up.  00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.882 So, if you want to ask about the weather, where she's at.  00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:07.700 Your, um, command really easily, and it provides\u2026 it seems like it provided the, uh, appropriate, uh, weather conditions and everything, and\u2026 Also, chances of rain, so that's\u2026 that's great.  00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:11.404 Good job asking a follow-up question, Michael, that was very good.  00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:22.272 Yeah. All right, let's find another task that\u2026 or another task or activity related to information seeking that you'd like to ask.  00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:30.996 You know what you want to ask? Yeah, Gemini, what's your favorite color? No, no, no, let's not do favorite color, let's think information setting.  00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:38.595 There's something in the world, something global, something\u2026 else. Hey, Gemini, what's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:45.512 Nope, it's capped the phone.  00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:52.553 In Gemini, what's the weather like in Africa? Africa's a big place, so the weather varies a lot.  00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:56.397 It could be hot and dry in the Sahara, or warm and humid in the Congo.  00:08:55.961 --> 00:09:00.961 Do you have a specific country or city in mind? Tanzania.  00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:08.254 Okay, in Tanzania, it's currently 71 degrees and partly cloudy. It's going to be mostly sunny.  00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:11.556 With a high of 82 and a low of 69 degrees.  00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.789 About Kenya.  00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.800 Okay, in Nairobi, Kenya, it's currently 55 degrees and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 77 degrees.  00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:29.612 And the low is 54 degrees. In Uganda?  00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:39.867 Okay, in Kampala, Uganda, it's currently 64 degrees and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 81 degrees.  00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:46.762 And the low is 63 degrees. Hi, is anyone who's above 64?  00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:51.214 Those are the three places his sister is going to be.  00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:49.397 That's great.  00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:56.810 Okay, that makes sense, okay, way to go, like, with asking all those follow-ups, Michael, again.  00:09:56.276 --> 00:10:20.276 Great job. Okay, so that\u2026 I think the live is working much better, um, when\u2026 whenever he's using Gemini. I guess when\u2026 in the first session, when we were trying to do the weather-related questions, it was\u2026 It was not taking the place, remember the location, and then we had to sort of say the location.  00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:03.795 Thank you.  00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:26.029 I think doing live makes. Like, I think it\u2026 it catches the location.  00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:34.205 I agree, and I think live for Michael especially, is a lot easier.  00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.689 On its own, or some\u2026 yeah.  00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:41.090 Because when you're not on live. You have to touch the button at the bottom.  00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.042 Mm-hmm.  00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:48.651 For the microphone, and then\u2026 If you want to stop, you have to find the stop button at the top of the phone.  00:10:45.503 --> 00:10:47.503 Yeah.  00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:56.225 And when you use VoiceOver, you can do that, but you have to go through a\u2026 it will read every single section.  00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:03.565 Live, you just touch the screen anywhere, and away you go. Touch the screen again, and it stops.  00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:01.361 Yeah. Right.  00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:12.886 Yeah, that's\u2026 that is really good. I think, um, yeah, I'm glad we found that, and found it really quick early on in the training, so that has helped a lot, I feel.  00:11:16.874 --> 00:11:23.874 And Michael can also ask S\u2026 You know, who asks this? To open up that app.  00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.390 Alright, um, so we'll move on. All right.  00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:26.299 Yeah. Okay.  00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.216 And then go to live, and it will just do it.  00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:32.454 Okay, alright, so that's even better, because if no one's around.  00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:36.088 You\u2026 he could always do that, right, Michael? Like, you can ask.  00:11:36.514 --> 00:11:45.514 Your phone\u2026 phone's assistant. Starting with us, and just say that open\u2026 or, like, start live on\u2026 on Gemini or something.  00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:45.301 Yeah.  00:11:46.189 --> 00:12:00.189 Okay. Alright. Okay, so Michael, the next topic we, um, we talked about was entertainment. Um, this was, I think, on one of the Tuesdays that you were not, um, not here, and you were at your therapy session.  00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.123 Yeah.  00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:14.426 So, from last year, you might remember that we talked about the different topics under entertainment. Um, it was related to searching information, related to media, listening to music, watching movies.  00:12:14.343 --> 00:12:24.343 Um, with Gemini and AI tools, you can also generate stories and generate any content, like, generate new content and new stories.  00:12:24.362 --> 00:12:32.362 Um, and you can also, um, tell jokes, um, and play trivia games like you were able to on Alexa.  00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:39.510 So, um, if you were to do two tasks related to entertainment, what would you pick.  00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:49.473 Vendetta, the movie?  00:12:45.762 --> 00:12:54.762 Okay. Alright, so, um, and what would you\u2026 which platform would you use? Which tool you would use for that?  00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:05.997 It could be your glasses, or Gemini, or even Alexa, or your phone's assistant.  00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:14.116 On us, Gemini. A Gemini, who made the VFA Vendetta movie?  00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:13.441 Okay, alright, let's try.  00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:24.271 B for Vendetta was directed by James McTeague, but the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis, who are famous for the Matrix movies.  00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:32.291 Is that correct, Michael? Okay. All right.  00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:37.776 Yeah. Michael, what do you use on a\u2026 multiple times during the day.  00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:46.716 With your glasses, what do you ask your glasses? No, you don't. What do you do multiple times? And I have to ask you to please stop.  00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:51.879 Timer? No. Play. Play games. No.  00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.500 Play your\u2026 Music. Play his music. Multiple times.  00:13:59.164 --> 00:14:05.164 He uses his glasses a lot to play his music, because it will play music from.  00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:04.972 Okay.  00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:10.738 Apple Music. Apple Music, or from Amazon. It'll\u2026 he has to tell it.  00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:24.661 Okay, alright. Do you want to try using one of those commands and see, um\u2026 so when you, when you use that command, does it\u2026 That will directly come via your earphones of the\u2026 of your glasses, correct?  00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.555 And\u2026  00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:33.879 Okay. Alright, we can try that. That works. Okay? Whenever you're ready.  00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:30.662 Yeah. Yeah.  00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:41.563 What do you want to listen to? It's on my phone. Okay.  00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.290 And whatever music you want to play.  00:14:45.962 --> 00:14:50.962 Can you say the command? Is it playing the music automatically? Yeah.  00:14:55.403 --> 00:14:57.403 It's playing the music automatically.  00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:06.889 Playing, sometimes Michael will say, um. He'll think of a song that he would like to hear, so he'll say, play whatever by whoever.  00:14:58.055 --> 00:15:00.055 Okay, so without even\u2026  00:15:06.803 --> 00:15:12.803 And the glasses will just play it. Or sometimes we could be in a store.  00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:12.805 Yeah.  00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:19.325 And you know how they play music in the stores? He can say, hey, Maida, what song is playing?  00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:25.930 And it made it will come back and tell him the name and author of whatever song is playing in the store.  00:15:23.468 --> 00:15:25.468 Mm-hmm.  00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:38.825 Okay, got it. So right now, I think it just heard us talking about playing music, and\u2026 Even Michael confirming that he wanted to play music, and then it just started playing music.  00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:52.976 Okay, got it. Alright, Michael, can you try changing a song or, um, giving it another command, which might help us kind of see how it works?  00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.735 Yes. Turn your music off on.  00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:58.223 Ask for something specific. Played double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:09.445 Is it working? Okay.  00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.519 Yeah. Here's\u2026 it just said, here's double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:11.528 --> 00:16:19.528 And so, what is the default when it comes to playing music? So, right now, like.  00:16:19.494 --> 00:16:36.494 Michael, you did not specify. That you're wanting to play on Amazon Music or, um, you know, something else, or Apple Music or anything. So how\u2026 Does it just take\u2026 any of those, um, platforms, or does it ask you?  00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:42.044 That there's double up on Nipsey Hussle. From Apple Music.  00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:47.264 So that must be the default, it goes straight to his Apple Music.  00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:47.882 Okay.  00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:50.669 Apple Music, okay. Makes sense.  00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:53.846 Did you put that in a playlist on your phone? Oh, and it was already on his phone, too.  00:16:54.572 --> 00:17:10.572 Got it, okay, great, makes sense. Alright, Michael, that's pretty good. Um, anything else you'd like to, um\u2026 do using Gemini especially, because I know you were not here during this particular, um.  00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:26.825 Topic training, so I wanted to see, um\u2026 like, you know, if you wanted to generate a story, or\u2026 I don't know if you've ever used to generate content like that, um\u2026 And if you were interested in doing that with Gemini.  00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:21.251 You know.  00:17:26.022 --> 00:17:31.022 Say you wanted to, like, you know, listen to a story.  00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:48.518 Specifically on, you know, um, your favorite animals, or, like, you know, something like\u2026 like, you know, anything it could be, or it could be, like, a day at the beach, or, you know, something\u2026 some of your favorite action movies or something.  00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:56.539 You could try using that and see if\u2026 Um, you give it a few details, and if it would come up with a story.  00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:06.675 For you. So, you want to tell us what you want to listen to first, and then maybe once, you know, that life starts and you can say it?  00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.548 Okay.  00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:12.679 I'm not\u2026 I can\u2026 or her to\u2026 Give me a short story about the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:19.604 Okay, yeah.  00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:25.549 Can you create a short story? Uh\u2026 short story for\u2026 For me, from the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:27.682 --> 00:18:33.682 In a dystopian London, a masked vigilante named V fights against a totalitarian regime.  00:18:33.797 --> 00:18:37.797 He rescues a young woman named Evie, and introduces her to his world of revolution.  00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:43.069 As they work together, Evie learns about V's past, and his plans to ignite a rebellion against the oppressive government.  00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:48.709 In the end, V's actions inspired the people. Thanks, Bill.  00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:52.868 Is that good? Yep. Is that what the movie was about? Yep.  00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:54.175 Yeah?  00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:58.054 Is that\u2026 is that the only information that came up, or was it, like, very long?  00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:05.397 I have to go back, just give me a sec.  00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:08.026 Oh. Oh, okay, okay. I was just curious.  00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:17.712 No, it was quite short. If you can\u2026 See that?  00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:27.939 Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay, that's pretty short, yeah. So it's like a few sentences, like, maybe, like, 3 to 4 sentences, which\u2026  00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:37.178 5 sentences, okay, alright. That's not too bad, it's definitely, like\u2026 much better than, like, you know, asking for news that time.  00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:32.659 Yep, I'd say 3, um, maybe about 5.  00:19:37.373 --> 00:19:52.373 And it, like, giving a bunch of information instead of, like, just\u2026 you know, trying to give you the gist of it, and this seems like almost\u2026 or just\u2026 or the summary of the entire movie, or the, you know, just the plot of the movie.  00:20:26.383 --> 00:20:38.383 You know? Yeah, that would be nice. Alright, so\u2026 Moving on, um, the third week, or the third session, was, um, self-care and medical needs.  00:20:31.252 --> 00:20:33.252 Yeah.  00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:44.486 So, uh, we\u2026 here we discussed, uh, topics related to medication management.  00:20:44.449 --> 00:20:54.449 Creating medication lists and finding medications. Um, searching for self-care tips, such as laundry or caring for a loved one or.  00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:58.178 And we asked a bunch of questions about your pet the last time.  00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:04.410 Um, and tips to improve mental and physical health, and searching for home remedies if you.  00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:12.798 Um, if you needed something. So, now, based on these topics, let's, um, find two activities again.  00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:23.810 Uh, related to self-care and medical needs, and then, um, we can practice those, and we'll base it on which, um, tool or platform to use, based on what you want to.  00:21:27.226 --> 00:21:32.226 Gemini? Okay, and what are you going to ask? And right from my head. Oh!  00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:29.766 Practice.  00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:38.175 What's that? Okay, alright.  00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.940 Could you say it louder so that I can hear it? Oh, I don't want to hear.  00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.400 How do I comb my hair?  00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:51.599 Well, there are a few ways to approach it. You could start by figuring out what kind of style you're going for.  00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:55.101 Do you want something classic, trendy, or maybe a bit edgy?  00:21:55.231 --> 00:22:05.231 Trendy. Okay, for something trendy, you could try a textured crop with a matte finish. Or, if you have longer hair.  00:22:05.238 --> 00:22:10.238 A messy quiff might work. Do either of those sound like something you'd like to try? What's a messy quiff?  00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:19.147 A messy quiff is a hairstyle that's shorter on the sides and back, but with longer hair on top that's styled upwards and slightly messy.  00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:25.238 It's a pretty popular look right now.  00:22:25.732 --> 00:22:29.732 You're welcome. Do you need help finding a good barber or salon? No, thanks.  00:22:32.524 --> 00:22:50.524 That is great! I wonder, um, that was\u2026 that was really good back-and-forth conversation, I think, and, um, things that I\u2026 that are\u2026 that are most amazing, I feel, and those are the differences between using, like, a.  00:22:50.728 --> 00:23:02.728 Alexa or Siri, versus, um, you know, Gemini, is, you know, even if there is hesitations or interruptions, uh, when a command is being presented.  00:23:02.535 --> 00:23:16.535 To that tool, it still picks up. Um, it doesn't\u2026 it's not very quick to say, oh, I did not understand. So the, um, the speech recognition is so much better, I think, like, that\u2026 and it leads to less frustration.  00:23:16.623 --> 00:23:21.623 Um. Yes, for sure.  00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:23.671 Great, and it's more social.  00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:34.959 Definitely more social, because it's asking good follow-up questions, too. Um, like, for example, right now, with the barber and, you know, finding something, and, um, just the back and forth, it feels more human, too.  00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:44.209 Um, and less robotic. So\u2026 Yeah.  00:23:37.094 --> 00:23:42.094 I have\u2026 I've noticed that\u2026 Um, the A device.  00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:47.991 Is the\u2026 is slowly getting a little bit more personable as well.  00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:56.568 Because, for example, tonight, um, Michael asked her to set a timer, and before she did, she said, good evening, Mike.  00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:54.034 Hmm\u2026  00:23:57.938 --> 00:24:00.938 Um, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes, or whatever it was.  00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:02.149 Oh.  00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:10.010 That's good, okay. Yeah, so it's definitely\u2026 it's getting into those greetings and a little bit of personalization.  00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:17.552 Based on who's talking to it, instead of, like, just. You know, generally answering like it would. So, yeah.  00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:25.740 That makes sense. Okay. Alright, Michael, what would be the next, uh, second task for you, uh, related to self-care and medical needs?  00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:32.102 Say, hey, Gemini, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:39.993 --> 00:24:41.993 Not that one? Yeah. Okay, one sec.  00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:51.767 Hey Jim, I thought I'd put gel in my hair. Okay, here's how to put gel in your hair. Start with a small amount, about a pea-sized drop, and rub it between your palms.  00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:57.500 Apply it evenly, working from the roots to the ends. Style as desired, and add more gel if needed.  00:24:58.782 --> 00:25:02.782 Yeah, thanks. I'll do that. Gemini?  00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:08.971 Okay. Four tips on styling it. Great, thank you, I will.  00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:09.974 That's good, okay.  00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:21.368 Okay. All right, perfect. Um\u2026 Okay, so the next one, um, next topic was meal preparation and cooking. Again, that one.  00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:30.229 Uh, was when, uh, on one of the\u2026 on past Tuesday, actually, when you were not around, so we can probably practice some of the commands from.  00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:34.949 Maybe last year you remember how we talked about making shopping lists.  00:25:34.225 --> 00:25:44.225 Um, by adding or viewing or, um, listing the items that were on the shopping list, and then removing items.  00:25:44.728 --> 00:25:51.728 Um, we could find recipes, um. Or find recipes related to some certain dietary restrictions.  00:25:52.986 --> 00:26:00.986 Whether it could be, um, gluten-free or vegan, um, or another one of the dietary restrictions that, um, some people might have.  00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:08.125 Finding nutritional facts about different foods, for example, number of grams of sugar or sodium.  00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:14.337 In a particular food item, um, finding calories in certain\u2026 some kind of food.  00:26:14.563 --> 00:26:23.563 Um, finding the ingredients for cooking a specific food. And then following the recipe and, like, instruction by instruction or step by step.  00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:31.177 So, based on all of those ideas, let's find two activities related to meal preparation.  00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:40.224 Um, before you do, I wanted to ask you, is there\u2026 Particularly anything that has changed from the past year that.  00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:47.858 You've been contributing more towards, uh, when it comes to meal preparation. Is there\u2026 Are there things that have changed?  00:26:47.258 --> 00:26:51.258 Um, while you are in the kitchen with your parents, or.  00:26:54.425 --> 00:26:58.425 Yeah, well, I came home from the Army. And\u2026 they weren't with me.  00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.330 You know, while you're helping them prep.  00:26:58.248 --> 00:27:09.248 So, that's a big change. Michael, what about, um, when going to Costco, what have you been doing more of?  00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:21.379 Putting the list on what? Okay? Yes. He's been making the list for us on\u2026 And then when we're at\u2026 for example, Costco.  00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:19.963 Okay.  00:27:21.942 --> 00:27:27.942 Because it comes with glasses, he will just say\u2026 I'll say to him, here's, you know, the strawberries, the bananas.  00:27:28.365 --> 00:27:34.365 And he'll tell her. Check off strawberries, check off bananas, that kind of thing. Interesting.  00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:40.673 Okay, so mainly manage\u2026 making and managing lists. Uh, for shopping is something that you do.  00:27:40.914 --> 00:27:53.914 Um, and I think, um, A is a perfect solution when it comes to something like that, or even\u2026 even the phone's assistant, um, S would do a better job, I guess, because it would directly put.  00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:59.265 On the notes, um, section, um, and make a list there, so that makes sense.  00:27:59.647 --> 00:28:06.647 Um, so let\u2026 do you think you want to try making a list? Or, like, is there something that you want to add to?  00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:13.252 Um, your shopping list, um, that we could, we could practice now, or is there something else that you would like to do?  00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:19.483 Michael, do you want to make a list, or do you want to\u2026 Yeah, I would like to make a list.  00:28:25.682 --> 00:28:27.682 Should I go to Alexa?  00:28:27.403 --> 00:28:31.403 Yeah, yeah, you can, uh, I think your mom's just getting Alexa\u2026  00:28:33.821 --> 00:28:35.821 Sure.  00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:49.434 Michael's phone is having some major technical difficulties. That on the side has broken off, so\u2026 We're waiting, kind of, for his sister to get back, so I can change the plan and the phones and everything.  00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:38.275 Oh, your iPad, okay, yeah.  00:28:42.845 --> 00:28:44.845 Oh!  00:28:56.498 --> 00:28:58.498 It's one of those things.  00:28:56.698 --> 00:29:03.698 Too many things when there's too\u2026 so many technologies together at use, so\u2026  00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.400 As your daughter gets older, you'll understand my pain.  00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:15.030 Okay, Michael, it's ready. Yeah, let's see\u2026 Add marshmallows to my Costco list.  00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:09.933 I know, I know.  00:29:20.352 --> 00:29:26.352 Okay, um, so are you\u2026 are you\u2026 are you managing, like, multiple lists?  00:29:21.321 --> 00:29:23.321 Marshmallows added to Costco.  00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:34.223 Because you said Costco list, so, um, are there, like. Different lists for different places that you usually manage?  00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:40.941 Yeah. What's the other one? Oops, Halbertson? Halbertson's.  00:29:44.014 --> 00:29:48.014 Go ahead. Hey, Alexa.  00:29:45.364 --> 00:29:48.364 Okay. Makes sense.  00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:54.663 Add cookies to my Albertson's most. Cookies added to Albertsons?  00:29:54.448 --> 00:30:05.448 Okay, perfect. That's really good. Um, anything else that you do with respect to meal preparation when you're in the kitchen?  00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:11.706 Um, with your dad or your mom while they're cooking, or before they start to cook?  00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:21.180 Hey, Alexa, I'd pass to the Albertsons list. That's the pasta on the olives.  00:30:22.374 --> 00:30:28.374 What else do you do, though, to help? Michael sometimes helps with, like, cutting or that type of thing.  00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:35.974 Oh, okay. Um, do you have any questions when you\u2026 when you have to do anything of that sort related to it?  00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:44.315 No, this guy, Cesar, he's my OT specialist. Got me some gloves that are pretty nice.  00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:55.245 Um, Michael sets a lot of timers, as well. For a meal. Tonight, you set a timer for the pizza, right?  00:30:48.645 --> 00:30:50.645 Okay. All right.  00:30:57.114 --> 00:30:58.114 Okay.  00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:14.808 Right. Like, how much, like, that would tell you, um, how much time you should boil something for, or, like, just steam something for, and just put a timer, and then\u2026 Okay. Got it. Alright, but that's pretty good. Like, I think managing lists was\u2026  00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:01.869 Um.  00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:20.588 It was definitely great. Um, do you\u2026 do you have anything else that you would like to find out, like.  00:31:20.917 --> 00:31:30.917 Um, finding caloric, um, calories in foods, or nutritional facts about any food that you'd like to ask, and maybe we could, this time try to use Gemini.  00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:36.243 And see if that works, and how that would work, because we've not gotten to practice this part.  00:31:38.064 --> 00:31:43.064 Okay? What question are you going to ask?  00:31:44.679 --> 00:31:49.679 How much sugar is in the cookies I eat? What can cookies are you talking about?  00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:56.206 Symptoms. Okay. To make sure\u2026 specific on the type, okay?  00:32:02.792 --> 00:32:04.792 How much sugar is in the Tim Tams?  00:32:04.606 --> 00:32:09.606 I couldn't find how much sugar is in Tim Tams. You might be able to find that information on the nutrition label.  00:32:09.863 --> 00:32:14.863 On the packaging, or on the manufacturer's website. Okay, thank you.  00:32:15.163 --> 00:32:19.163 Hey, Gemini. Much sugar is in the mono?  00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:27.259 Okay, according to the official Milo website, a cup of Milo has about 1 teaspoon of added sugar.  00:32:27.127 --> 00:32:33.127 That's on top of the natural sugars from the milk and malt barley. Does that answer your question? Yeah, it does. Thank you.  00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:40.363 Okay, so that's good. I mean, if it doesn't have\u2026 an answer to any question, then it will just say that.  00:32:40.548 --> 00:32:49.548 You know, it\u2026 I don't know about that. Yeah, and where to find it. Yeah, that's\u2026 that's really good.  00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:49.509 Yeah, and where to find it?  00:32:49.557 --> 00:33:02.557 Alright, so that's the end of our review. Um, let me stop sharing for a minute, and then\u2026 We'll move on to, um, some of the questions.  00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:11.716 That we have here, uh\u2026 okay. All right, um, so I'm just gonna ask.  00:33:11.962 --> 00:33:18.962 This was also the last time that we did the training that, um, we just asked questions about how you find the training.  00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:28.933 Um, what kind of problems or challenges you faced, and, um, just sharing about the AI in general, and the training satisfaction, etc, okay?  00:33:29.184 --> 00:33:35.184 So I'll start, Michael, with you, um, and Maureen, you can chime in anytime you, um.  00:33:35.064 --> 00:33:44.064 Anytime you think you wanted to contribute. So, some of these questions I'm starting with are related to AI satisfaction.  00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:55.920 So, was it difficult or easy for you to use your, um, AI? So, Gemini or your glasses, for that matter? We're going to take both into consideration, since.  00:33:56.342 --> 00:34:07.342 We've used both through the training, and you use those. I think you use your glasses a lot during your day-to-day life, so\u2026 tell me about it, how easy or difficult you think.  00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:12.691 I'm using in my glass store. Thank you, Gemini.  00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:19.450 Okay. Okay, so same with Gemini and ER glasses, it's easy for you to use them. Okay.  00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:26.969 I think both the glasses in Gemini pick up where. The A device.  00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:26.099 All right.  00:34:27.314 --> 00:34:34.314 Leaves off, basically. They all have their place, truly. They truly have their own place.  00:34:32.765 --> 00:34:34.765 Yeah.  00:34:34.195 --> 00:34:44.195 But I can see, um\u2026 For certain activities, one is better than the other, but if you can't get the answer on one, you can go to another. And that's nice, having that option.  00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:52.985 Yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, what specific problems. Um, have you faced with Gemini?  00:34:52.613 --> 00:35:07.613 Um, for example, does it have\u2026 difficulties understanding your speech, um, or does it have any difficulties understanding your language, or\u2026 or any sort of navigation issues that you've had with Gemini?  00:35:08.992 --> 00:35:13.992 There's not really any. Um, actually, no.  00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:20.792 When we were in the car on Tuesday, we asked a question, and it.  00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:29.900 Could not understand what we were asking. Um, so we had to rework it. I'm trying to think of what that question was. Me too.  00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:43.125 It had to do with that boat in Australia. We had to, um\u2026 I think it was the way the question was worded the first time, it was unable\u2026 it gave information, but it was not.  00:35:43.507 --> 00:35:50.507 Accurate. It was about something that happened somewhere else in Australia. But when we added, um\u2026 The Banana Beach?  00:35:51.473 --> 00:35:59.473 Yes, that's right. When we added Brisbane to it. Where we're a little bit more specific, it gave a more specific answer.  00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:04.696 Okay, makes sense. All right, so that.  00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:10.747 But when it comes to\u2026 so, you have to sometimes tweak your language and the words.  00:36:10.504 --> 00:36:15.504 Um, to make sure that it gives the information that you're looking for.  00:36:15.196 --> 00:36:27.196 That makes sense. Okay. All right, um\u2026 how about speech? I think\u2026 Is there any difficulty? Do you feel with respect to understanding of speech, or.  00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:41.874 Um, navigation with Gemini, I think ever since you found the live option, that\u2026 He could go live on Gemini. I think it's\u2026 it's really good. I guess the navigation has become much easier.  00:36:42.328 --> 00:36:46.328 Yes, it has. But remember last week when we were on live?  00:36:46.862 --> 00:36:53.862 Asked it a question, and they couldn't answer that question. Remember? I can't remember what it was for.  00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:52.611 Yeah.  00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:59.950 I can't remember what it was, but we were\u2026 we asked a question on live, and it said you have to go.  00:37:01.403 --> 00:37:09.403 Oh, oh, I think it was, like, um, asking us to link it to Google Workspace or something, and it was about the events.  00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:06.333 We don't have the capability yet to\u2026  00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:19.644 Um, trying to\u2026 Yeah, trying to set up events, um, and the same happened\u2026 What's that?  00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:16.866 Something along those lines, yeah.  00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:30.031 Calendar, yes, yes. It kind of told that, um, it would not be able to\u2026 yes, that\u2026 those kind of questions, I guess, are tasks where.  00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:24.785 On the calendar, that's right.  00:37:30.243 --> 00:37:35.243 It's linked to a certain calendar. If it does not have access to it, it's gonna have a hard time.  00:37:35.577 --> 00:37:57.577 Um, linking it, or, you know, that's going to be definitely there. So, when it comes to reminders, or scheduling appointments, or any of that, I guess, um\u2026 the others are much better, instead of, like, using AI, and I think you're already doing that, and it's\u2026 that's perfect, you know? Whatever's working is working, and\u2026  00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:06.250 We don't want to fix what's not broken, you know? So it's\u2026 That's\u2026 that's good. Um, alright. So\u2026 that's good.  00:38:06.698 --> 00:38:17.698 Um, what do you like most about having Gemini, Michael? Yeah. So the speech recognition part is very good.  00:38:14.901 --> 00:38:16.901 He understands me pretty well.  00:38:17.718 --> 00:38:26.718 Um, it's\u2026 it's a much\u2026 I think it's, um, it's much better when\u2026 when compared to last\u2026 last year's training with Alexa, I guess, because.  00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:47.030 You know, if there were words or names of movies. Um, people or topics, you know, or something like a proper noun. And I think it was not correctly pronounced, it would not take that, like, and it would\u2026 You know, we had so much reworking always with the commands that we used to do.  00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:54.733 Um, so that definitely is\u2026 it's really good. Um, and then what do you dislike the most about having Gemini?  00:38:55.526 --> 00:38:59.526 A good thing, too, is Gemini allows a bit of a pause.  00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:03.959 Um, a lot of times, your follow-up question has to be really quick.  00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:10.449 There's Gemini allows a little bit more of a pause, allows a little bit more time for that follow-up question.  00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:09.959 Yeah.  00:39:10.499 --> 00:39:16.499 Um, actually, and it allows a little bit more time than Michael's glasses allows.  00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:23.665 Oh, okay. So that's even a difference between those two, um, AI tools, I mean, in that case.  00:39:23.774 --> 00:39:34.774 That's great, okay. Um\u2026 Yeah, there's definitely, um\u2026 and sometimes if you, if, if you\u2026 talk too quickly after, you know, the.  00:39:34.753 --> 00:39:42.753 Um, after seeing the wake word, it still takes that information. Um, and if sometimes you don't say Gemini.  00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:50.310 And you start just talking when you're alive, it still takes up that information. You don't have to every time say that, which.  00:39:50.983 --> 00:40:04.983 Which I think is really good when it comes to, um\u2026 You know, just normal\u2026 normalizing, like, a conversation between two humans. Like, you don't always\u2026 say the person's name or something, right? So that\u2026 that makes sense.  00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:08.062 A little bit of a sound, because Michael didn't have to ask.  00:40:08.086 --> 00:40:20.086 Use, say, Gemini. Tonight at all, because it makes a little sound. I don't know if you heard the sound, but it's almost like a\u2026 Like, when you turn on a device, you can hear a little sound.  00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:17.979 Yeah.  00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:25.501 Like a whoosh, so to speak, and so he would hear that, and then just go from there.  00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:24.369 Um, okay.  00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:31.330 Right, so you would know that it's on, and, like, you can\u2026 you can talk now, and makes sense.  00:40:31.722 --> 00:40:35.722 Is there anything that you dislike about Gemini, about having Gemini?  00:40:40.092 --> 00:40:46.092 That's the difference between Gemini and A, because A just gives you a blue light.  00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.406 No? Okay. All right.  00:40:46.564 --> 00:40:52.564 Yeah. Yes. Yeah.  00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:50.667 And if you cannot see the blue light, you don't know if it's on or not.  00:40:53.990 --> 00:41:02.990 That's a big difference, that's right. Um, what would you change to Gemini, um, to make it easier to use? Is there anything?  00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:58.058 So that's a big difference between the two.  00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:09.967 Divorce recognition? Well, but it is recognizing your voice.  00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:30.175 Yeah, I think that's\u2026 that's what I think speech and word recognition is pretty good when you're comparing, um, Gemini to A, I guess, because it\u2026 It's definitely doing better, but is there anything that you would change to make it\u2026  00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.073 Speed recognition?  00:41:30.636 --> 00:41:39.636 In any other aspect, like how, um\u2026 It could be anything else, too, and, you know, it doesn't have to be something.  00:41:42.516 --> 00:41:48.516 Speech recognition? Um, we're not sure if Gemini goes through Michael's glasses or not.  00:41:48.762 --> 00:41:53.762 And so, if it doesn't, that would be a definite plus.  00:41:53.750 --> 00:42:00.750 Because remember, made us doing their own AI, so I don't know that it would go through the glasses.  00:42:00.797 --> 00:42:19.797 Yeah, yeah. Because, you know, like, the glasses allow him to\u2026 add things to the\u2026 to A, and, like, you know, for the shopping list and things like that, so those two can be synced, but\u2026 Yeah, I'm not sure. That might be something to look into, um, if those\u2026 if it would\u2026  00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:41.199 Allow Gemini or, you know, some other, like, chat GPT or something, but\u2026 I believe it would not\u2026 Yeah, because you know how Alexa does not allow S, or S does not allow A, like, something\u2026 because those are\u2026 the parallels, like, they are competitors, almost.  00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:20.739 And\u2026  00:42:32.972 --> 00:42:34.972 I agree.  00:42:41.638 --> 00:42:47.638 So I guess that would be\u2026 Yes.  00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:50.210 Classes allow Surrey. But probably because that glass is, no, you need the phone to work.  00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:58.712 Yeah, and I think the glasses might be also okay with, like, a regular Google Assistant.  00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:57.125 Because the glass is paired to the film, so I think that's\u2026  00:42:59.038 --> 00:43:12.038 But not, like, an AI-powered. You know what I mean? Because it has its own AI, but that's interesting. Maybe it's worth checking. Like, I don't know whether, you know, it could just surprise us by having.  00:43:15.502 --> 00:43:22.502 The glasses are paired with the Be My Eyes app. That is their accessibility feature for the blind.  00:43:16.178 --> 00:43:19.178 You know, having the ability to sync.  00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:24.548 Okay. Okay.  00:43:21.978 --> 00:43:26.978 And so that is one thing that they truly are paired with.  00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:42.498 Right, right. Okay, that's\u2026 that's good to know, okay. Alright, so in this training, um, we covered\u2026 four topics. So, we did, um\u2026 news and facts, which is information seeking.  00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:51.938 Um, entertainment, self-care, medical needs. And meal preparation. Um, what topic would you continue to use after this training?  00:43:55.872 --> 00:43:59.872 With, um, with Gemini, especially, and why.  00:44:01.184 --> 00:44:03.184 Meal preparation.  00:44:03.892 --> 00:44:11.892 Because\u2026 I think my parents would be\u2026 Happy if I didn't create a meal preparation.  00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:06.895 Okay. Is there a reason why?  00:44:12.053 --> 00:44:19.053 Yeah, uh, that, for sure, but\u2026 I\u2026 Yes.  00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:22.156 For you personally, forget about us. Entertainment. Go ahead, say it again.  00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:25.269 Entertainment. Okay.  00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:35.296 Um, what specifically in entertainment would you use it for?  00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:43.295 Okay. Um\u2026 Anything new, because you're already doing those things, right? Like, you are playing songs already using your glasses.  00:44:35.698 --> 00:44:37.698 And my favorite songs.  00:44:43.379 --> 00:44:51.379 Is there anything new you would do with, um, with using Gemini, and especially related to entertainment?  00:44:53.887 --> 00:45:04.887 Think about learning, maybe, about\u2026 more about, um\u2026 the different songs, or the different actors, or\u2026 Different movies.  00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:10.848 Yeah. He just said, like, what happened to Hulk Hogan?  00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:12.795 What did you say?  00:45:13.384 --> 00:45:20.384 Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, so that, that makes sense. So, like, you would, you would want to get more information about those.  00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.090 Because, you know, it's all over the news right now.  00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:37.674 You know, those particular\u2026 movies or series related to entertainment, and\u2026 maybe generate, like, synopsis, or\u2026 you know, a little summary of the movie, or a book, or, you know\u2026 Yeah, that would\u2026 that would be great.  00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:43.892 All right, um, so what are your goals\u2026 what were your goals?  00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:51.415 Before we started this training, and have you met them?  00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.260 What was your goal? What was one of your goals? Was it to learn more about Gemini, or\u2026?  00:45:55.302 --> 00:46:02.302 Have you\u2026 do you feel you've met that goal, or\u2026? You think you have?  00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:18.938 We were at the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum. On the weekend. Michael used his glasses a lot there. You know, what am I looking at? You know, you're looking at an Oscar statue by whatever.  00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:08.445 Okay. Yeah.  00:46:15.895 --> 00:46:16.895 Uh-huh.  00:46:16.978 --> 00:46:20.978 Yeah. Mm-hmm.  00:46:19.036 --> 00:46:24.036 Or, you know, the costume that Ryan Seek. Was it\u2026 who was it? Brian Gilligan.  00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:30.179 Ryan, whatever, the guy that wore the pink suit with the diamonds for Barbie?  00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:40.410 I gotta describe that, so he used the glasses a lot for that, to\u2026 what am I looking at? And he was getting information about the different things at the museum.  00:46:34.389 --> 00:46:36.389 Yeah, yeah.  00:46:40.961 --> 00:46:45.961 Yeah, okay. So, that's\u2026 I think the glasses are such a good.  00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:55.550 Tool to have, especially when you're traveling and going places, just to\u2026 get more information, and it's portable enough.  00:46:55.538 --> 00:46:58.538 And you don't have to take your phone out each time.  00:46:58.256 --> 00:47:04.256 To, um, sort of, you know, get, get whatever information you need. So that's perfect.  00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:11.588 Um, so, you've definitely gotten better using AI tools within your class.  00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:21.498 Glasses, and anything else. Um\u2026 that you\u2026  00:47:15.576 --> 00:47:29.576 In the car, on the way back from that museum. We use Gemini to ask a question about, um\u2026 it was something related to the museum. I honestly can't remember what it was.  00:47:25.158 --> 00:47:27.158 Yeah.  00:47:29.332 --> 00:47:34.332 A friend of Michael's was also in the car with us and had asked a question about.  00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:35.158 Yeah.  00:47:34.869 --> 00:47:42.869 One of the shows or things that we saw there. Is it, like, when was the movie, like, Casablanca, or something like that? I can't remember.  00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:47.109 Yeah. Oh.  00:47:42.282 --> 00:47:47.282 What year, so we asked Gemini. That I do remember distinctly.  00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:58.708 Yeah, no, no, but that's great, okay, and, um, did you pick\u2026 Was that your first choice? Like, that you wanted to ask Gemini? And\u2026 okay, alright.  00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.881 I don't remember what movie, for example.  00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:04.560 That's\u2026 Gemini, yeah, okay.  00:48:02.942 --> 00:48:06.942 Gemini, rather than Google it, we just ask Gemini.  00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:09.511 Alright, so, Michael, do you have any suggestions for this training program?  00:48:09.285 --> 00:48:16.285 Ask Gemini what her favorite color is. Michael! So pretty good, guys.  00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:33.046 Anything specific that you have? Like, any suggestions you may have for us, or for the training program, or how it should be, or\u2026 Um, anything differently that we should do.  00:48:21.708 --> 00:48:23.708 Forget the color!  00:48:37.303 --> 00:48:39.303 When is Google gonna let you go?  00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:44.863 When is Google gonna let you leave? Leave what? Good job. Okay.  00:48:46.325 --> 00:48:57.325 I'd say the format that you're doing is very good, and doing the breakout rooms is good, the questions\u2026 the slides that you have, because, um.  00:48:49.294 --> 00:48:50.294 Oh!  00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:05.100 If Michael could see, he would be able to refer back to the slides. I know I was looking at the slides when you would ask your question.  00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.860 Yeah. Okay. Great, okay.  00:49:05.622 --> 00:49:22.622 So I think it's a very good format. And the way that you, um, read it out loud for Michael enables him to participate, so I think\u2026 Yeah, you've made\u2026 You've done the training in a way that, um, maintains Michael's interest.  00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:21.361 For sure.  00:49:22.348 --> 00:49:44.348 Oh, for sure. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's really nice to know. Um, alright, so\u2026 So, do you have any\u2026 questions or feedback about Gemini's responses? Anything\u2026 with the responses that went well, and any challenges that you encounter with the responses that.  00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:54.261 Ever since we started, like, related to Gemini. Um, yeah, any responses that you particularly like, and those went well.  00:49:58.761 --> 00:50:00.761 Versus some things that didn't go well.  00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:04.764 Not that I could think of. I think the responses that were more personable.  00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:06.746 Okay.  00:50:05.438 --> 00:50:09.438 Um, kept Michael's interest, and then he would ask a follow-up question.  00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.920 Yeah, yeah. Back and forth. Mm-hmm.  00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:14.062 Yeah, you could just almost see a conversation going back and forth.  00:50:17.968 --> 00:50:24.968 And if it wasn't as personable, or Gemini wasn't quite understanding what the question was\u2026 Just basically say what?  00:50:29.156 --> 00:50:39.156 Yeah, yeah, that was the good part. Um\u2026 Definitely, like, how\u2026 especially with the sugar content that you just asked, like, you know, I did not know the answer.  00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:33.125 It kind of cut the conversation quickly.  00:50:39.566 --> 00:50:48.566 And it still gave you a good\u2026 follow-up, like, you know, response that, oh, you could check here, like, you know, instead of, like, just giving a vague and incorrect answer.  00:50:48.285 --> 00:50:56.285 Um, so that makes sense. Um, what are some of the challenges that you encountered, um, when asking for responses?  00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:13.010 Speech recognition? I would guess not responding\u2026 quick enough. Like, not ask\u2026 If you weren't quite sure what you were asking.  00:51:13.924 --> 00:51:18.924 And you start talking, and you're not\u2026 and you're trying to come up with the correct answer.  00:51:17.478 --> 00:51:19.478 Mm-hmm.  00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:23.646 Yeah. Okay, okay.  00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:24.776 She loses you. A little bit quicker.  00:51:24.506 --> 00:51:33.506 Be a little bit quicker in terms of responses, okay. Um, anything else that you can think of when it comes to challenges?  00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:40.244 She understands me most of the time, but not all the time.  00:51:40.747 --> 00:51:45.747 Okay. All right, um, can you give me an example?  00:51:45.707 --> 00:51:51.707 Of when she doesn't understand? Yeah.  00:51:48.726 --> 00:51:56.726 When she doesn't? Angie, when you mumble a little bit? You wanna mumble a little bit? She'll be like, what did you say?  00:51:57.611 --> 00:52:03.611 I'll clear my throat and say\u2026 I've said this, that, or the third.  00:52:00.569 --> 00:52:02.569 Yeah. Yeah.  00:52:04.804 --> 00:52:11.804 Okay, all right. That makes sense, okay. Um\u2026 Another\u2026 this is my personal thing, but.  00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:26.059 I think when we first started and we did the\u2026 Participatory design, especially when we were talking about all the responses, Michael. Um, and you know how you asked about the conflict between Israel and Iran.  00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:30.210 And it just sort of gave you, like, so much information at once.  00:52:45.419 --> 00:52:53.419 Oh, hi! Claire, um, are we done with Michael?  00:52:53.220 --> 00:53:01.220 No, we're still on 3.1. Yeah. No, you're good. Are you\u2026 yeah, I don't know.  00:52:55.207 --> 00:53:07.207 Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I mostly just want to say bye to Michael, and then we'll probably let her go, yeah, because we finished early, sorry about that.  00:53:09.155 --> 00:53:27.155 Okay. Um\u2026 Let's see, Rosie, I may just, um, ask you to share with Claire and Peter, um, like, one quick command, and then maybe we don't get enough time to show Michael.  00:53:27.531 --> 00:53:47.531 If you want to show them stuff you work on today as a final, um\u2026 Oh, there, there's Prayal. Hi! Sorry for interrupting, I know you two are still going. Um, Rosie, you wanna say hi before our summer program ends, so I just figured Rosie will show something, and then we'll let you go back to the room again.  00:53:30.662 --> 00:53:32.662 Great, okay.  00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:57.827 Oh, yeah, I was just gonna\u2026 I was using Gemini for, um\u2026 Like, through the health, um, like, personal health, um.  00:53:51.446 --> 00:53:53.446 Yeah, sorry about interrupting.  00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:03.590 Like. Like, things to do to, like.  00:54:03.606 --> 00:54:14.606 Calm yourself down. So it's like, um\u2026 like, calming yourself doing music and going outside, and just like\u2026 she would give me a list of things to do.  00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:25.280 And is doing creative and doing, um\u2026 self-care, and I\u2026 is music soothing? Does I\u2026 Using, um, Gemini to give you these.  00:54:25.057 --> 00:54:42.057 That are problems, so you can find. Find, like, calm, or just being\u2026 in a good state of mind through things like journaling and the aromatherapy, and just\u2026 He's even just petting them, or just listening to music and writing it down so they\u2026  00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:59.779 Do you ever know is a platform I can get all these\u2026 it's just, like, a short list of things, you just care for yourself, like doing exercise, or\u2026 Lucky, she wants you, oh, you can do some aromatherapy and\u2026 Jess, she just gives you a list of things you can back yourself up with, like, self-care.  00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:06.510 Rosie is sharing the list of things that Gemini told her, and she shared her screen.  00:55:06.276 --> 00:55:12.276 Showing the different, um. Suggestions that Jim and I gave her. Okay, that's nice.  00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:18.043 You can do this. Yeah\u2026  00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:21.510 And do you want to read, um, maybe one more thing, one or two things that you may, um.  00:55:16.662 --> 00:55:18.662 Share your screen, Rosie.  00:55:21.098 --> 00:55:26.098 Do this summer, so Michael can know your summer\u2026 rest of your summer plan?  00:55:26.439 --> 00:55:33.439 Oh, like, you know\u2026 Like, like, end of next week, and coming next couple weeks.  00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.680 The U.S. Open of Surfing is in Huntington, and we're using Gemini to, um.  00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:44.447 They find parking and\u2026 They're looking for, um, survey competitions, because.  00:55:44.294 --> 00:55:50.294 We asked her about, like. One will be the longboard surfing, um.  00:55:50.275 --> 00:56:02.275 Contest happened, because I like surfing longboard, because. I was just, like, want to watch that, because I'm not that\u2026 really that great, but I just like watching, so just using Gemini to, like.  00:56:01.967 --> 00:56:09.967 Giving information about things I like to watch, just\u2026 Just to, um, for my own summer plans, yeah.  00:56:14.598 --> 00:56:18.598 Michael, do you have anything you want to tell Rosie before we let her go?  00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.538 Thank you for the information, Rosie.  00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:24.387 Tell her, um, what we asked, um, Gemini when we were in the car, coming back from the beach.  00:56:24.858 --> 00:56:28.858 We asked Gemini to, uh\u2026 We're gonna streamline where we were.  00:56:29.592 --> 00:56:34.592 About the boat in Australia. About the boat in Australia. There's a boat that crashed.  00:56:35.407 --> 00:56:41.407 That crashed on Rainbow Beach. And my boss told us about Rainbow Beach, because he was from Australia.  00:56:44.035 --> 00:56:53.035 And this ship crashed in the 80s, or the 70s. And so Gemini gave an obscure fact that was truthful.  00:56:56.965 --> 00:57:06.965 Oh, no, thanks. Here you go, like, a family connection, but it's like\u2026 kind of is\u2026 I don't know if history's\u2026 feel, you feel it.  00:56:57.079 --> 00:57:01.079 From the 70s, when his father lived in Australia, and\u2026  00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:07.289 Yeah.  00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:14.630 His dad had told him a story, and Michael verified the story with Gemini.  00:57:11.057 --> 00:57:13.057 Some kind of connection, yeah.  00:57:14.004 --> 00:57:31.004 Oh, yeah, using that, it's kind of\u2026 it's like\u2026 This really happened, like\u2026 Okay, is it\u2026 Gemini knows it was there, so\u2026 backing information to what your dad told you, so you\u2026 It was a real thing, so\u2026 used to jeopardize, like, another\u2026  00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:36.125 I think another perspective. For us to, like, use in our life, yeah.  00:57:32.964 --> 00:57:34.964 Yeah.  00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:44.413 Thank you so much for sharing, Michael, and pray I'll let you folks go back into your room.  00:57:40.588 --> 00:57:42.588 Yeah, that's right.  00:57:45.126 --> 00:57:53.126 Yeah, and um, Kaylee and Lori and Orisha and Rosie, you are afraid to go. Have a\u2026 Nice up the summer, we'll stay in touch.  00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:49.756 Okay.  00:57:50.828 --> 00:57:54.828 All right, okay. Okay, bye.  00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:05.597 Thank you, you guys, too.  00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:23.211 Okay, so you want me to take the notes? Okay.  00:58:22.352 --> 00:58:32.352 Um, alright, so, um\u2026 Yeah, sorry, Maureen. I think we were talking about\u2026 Where do we go?  00:58:33.046 --> 00:58:40.046 Yeah, um\u2026 from your perspective, how can we make the AI responses more relevant to you?  00:58:43.045 --> 00:58:50.045 Right, and\u2026 I remember we were just talking about it, and then it went off.  00:58:45.305 --> 00:58:47.305 That's\u2026 that's the question we were discussing.  00:58:54.818 --> 00:58:59.818 I know, I know. Um\u2026  00:58:58.951 --> 00:59:02.951 To make the AI more relevant. Um.  00:59:04.106 --> 00:59:14.106 Well, I think Gemini picks up. Where maybe the glasses lets off, or Alexa likes\u2026 Um, where the different devices.  00:59:04.996 --> 00:59:05.996 Yeah.  00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:25.930 Stop Gemini picks up. And it gives\u2026 And another opportunity, like, if you can't get the answer from your phone on Chess.  00:59:18.419 --> 00:59:20.419 Yeah. Mhm.  00:59:26.831 --> 00:59:40.831 Because from my era, I was new to Google, we would just start Googling everything, and now it's almost as if you don't need to Google anymore, you can just ask Gemini, and you'll get an instant response.  00:59:40.227 --> 00:59:45.227 And for Michael, who grew up with all of the technology.  00:59:45.265 --> 00:59:52.265 It's so easy for him just to ask his glasses, or\u2026 because he's wearing them most times, and he will say.  00:59:52.275 --> 00:59:59.275 Well, I need my glasses to see. And so, because it tells him the information that he needs.  00:59:59.055 --> 01:00:08.055 More so than just asking the phone anymore. If the glasses isn't giving the answer quick enough, he can ask Gemini.  01:00:07.967 --> 01:00:16.967 Yes. Okay, so, like, different tools will give different kind of responses, and there were one\u2026 if one falls short, something.  01:00:17.173 --> 01:00:23.173 There's another platform to pick up and try that for asking that particular question.  01:00:23.352 --> 01:00:35.352 Okay, that makes sense. Um\u2026 All right. Um\u2026 So, any command examples that you can specifically share when it comes to.  01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:44.140 Um, you know, how one\u2026 uh, one platform will let\u2026 let off, and then, you know, some other platform would pick up.  01:00:45.955 --> 01:00:50.955 All I can think of is the calendar. If you ask.  01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.430 Is there a specific example?  01:00:51.138 --> 01:01:02.138 Um, S on the phone. What am I doing today? Or what's\u2026 on my calendar. She might say, oh, you have 3 events today.  01:00:58.177 --> 01:01:04.177 Yeah. Mm-hmm.  01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.200 Yeah.  01:01:02.003 --> 01:01:09.003 And you can say, what are the events? You have 3 events today. Whereas if you ask Alexa.  01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:16.501 She was like, you have 3 events today. At 8 o'clock, you are going to the brain, and at 10 o'clock, you have.  01:01:13.284 --> 01:01:15.284 Uh-huh.  01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:21.365 A dental appointment. It will give\u2026 it will literally read your calendar to you.  01:01:22.009 --> 01:01:28.009 And then the downfall is Gemini won't go into your calendar unless they have access.  01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:27.465 Correct.  01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:46.530 Yeah. Um, can you think of something other way around where\u2026 where AI or Gemini, where\u2026 Um, and the glasses would pick up and, and where Alexa or\u2026 S would not respond to, or not respond appropriately.  01:01:51.523 --> 01:01:54.523 Are there any topics or examples like that?  01:01:56.409 --> 01:02:09.409 Um\u2026 Well, with the glasses, Michael can\u2026 is really good, like, with playing a lot of his music, and then asking questions about the author.  01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:16.224 Who wrote the song, or when did it come out, or\u2026 play something similar to it.  01:02:16.893 --> 01:02:21.893 And it's all linked to his\u2026 to the Apple Music, right? And which is on this phone.  01:02:17.563 --> 01:02:19.563 Yeah.  01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:28.808 Whereas\u2026 the A Alexa is more linked to.  01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:40.892 Amazon Music. Um\u2026 And I would guess, um, we haven't done it, but actually, we kind of did it in a roundabout way.  01:02:34.676 --> 01:02:36.676 Right.  01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:54.283 Asking Gemini about certain things related to that song. You could get it, and especially\u2026 Like, if the song is from a movie, for example, when we were at the museum in Los Angeles last weekend.  01:02:54.328 --> 01:03:06.328 He could have said, what is the theme song from Casablanca? And that type of thing, and he would have gotten that from Gemini, and probably gotten more information from Gemini than from his classes.  01:03:02.876 --> 01:03:04.876 Yeah.  01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:20.381 Got it, okay, okay. All right, makes sense. Um, so we're interested in designing the AI response to be more interactive, um, so\u2026 imagine, like, a virtual clinician.  01:03:20.275 --> 01:03:28.275 Um, for you to, um, help you with your needs. Um, so when this training is not on, um, say you needed.  01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:34.172 You know, any, any, um\u2026 anything that you need, like a virtual clinician for.  01:03:34.297 --> 01:03:39.297 What kinds of help would you like to receive from this kind of agent?  01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:44.830 Well, I think what Michael did tonight, when we were doing those examples with his hair.  01:03:45.206 --> 01:03:51.206 And yeah, it's like, how do I comb my hair? Because that's one thing in EOS, I, have I done my hair properly?  01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:50.662 Yes.  01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:58.128 And he asked that follow-up question, how do I apply the type of hairsty, and then the hair gel.  01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.240 Yeah. No. Mm-hmm.  01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:06.327 That was all very relevant to a 25-year-old. And so, I think that was very appropriate.  01:04:05.238 --> 01:04:07.238 Yeah, yeah.  01:04:06.129 --> 01:04:12.129 Um, I could see the virtual\u2026 I mean, it worked with Gemini doing that, right?  01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.412 Mm-hmm.  01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:18.052 Right, right.  01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:32.434 And, um\u2026 more so, like, stuff like that. Um\u2026 how do I\u2026 I would guess you could even say something like, how do I\u2026 brush my teeth to make sure I clean them all, or, um\u2026  01:04:27.507 --> 01:04:35.507 Yeah, yeah. So, would you say that when it comes to, like, a virtual agent or a virtual clinician, it would be more of.  01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:51.704 Um, providing ideas of what. Kind of questions and what kind of content he could ask for. Um, so that the\u2026 he could use the, um, platforms or the tools to the fullest of its ability.  01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:59.472 I think so, yeah. Um\u2026 Because I think the biggest difference is Michael has a TBI.  01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:12.661 And so\u2026 And me being older, and so I'm having to try to figure it out compared to someone like Peter, for example, who is.  01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:05.573 Yeah.  01:05:12.444 --> 01:05:20.444 Closer in age to Michael, who doesn't have a TBI, I'm sure he just can come up with stuff like this, where, um.  01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:25.048 Right. Yeah. Right.  01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:28.184 Michael's starting to get back to that type of way, whereas for me, it's a whole new learning experience.  01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:41.749 Correct. Correct. Okay, alright, that makes so much sense. Um, thank you for sharing that. Um, okay, so\u2026 Um, what information do you want to share with this kind of virtual agent?  01:05:42.993 --> 01:05:51.993 Or what information do you want the agent to learn, so that it could help you with the homework, or\u2026 like, the training of this training.  01:05:53.136 --> 01:06:00.136 Um, I think the more you use the AI, the more the AI learns about you.  01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:10.060 So, for instance, with Michael's glasses. He can ask a question, like, um\u2026 I'm blonde. Hey, Maida!  01:06:10.544 --> 01:06:13.544 What am I looking at? And Maida will give a description.  01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:21.802 And then Michael can say, remember, Maida, I'm blind, and my Maida will then give a more comprehensive description.  01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:19.588 Mm-hmm.  01:06:21.587 --> 01:06:31.587 As somebody's looking at. And so, the AI responds to that when you say, remember, I'm blind, or I am blind, what am I looking at?  01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:27.888 Yeah.  01:06:31.702 --> 01:06:34.702 Or, I am blind, is it safe to cross the street?  01:06:34.443 --> 01:06:46.443 That's not a good example, because they won't\u2026 no AI will tell you it's safe to cross the street because that's a safety issue. But, um, it might say, are there any cars in my vicinity?  01:06:35.613 --> 01:06:37.613 Yes.  01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:48.625 Yeah. Yes.  01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:54.293 She's fine. Yeah, she's right there, she's okay. She was asking about the dog.  01:06:54.673 --> 01:07:04.673 But I think, um\u2026 Yeah, so no AI will tell you, yes, you can cross the street, but they can tell you, um, if you say, remember, I'm blind.  01:07:04.924 --> 01:07:07.924 What is on the sign above me. It will read the sign.  01:07:07.696 --> 01:07:16.696 Right. Yeah, and it's almost like\u2026 you want to learn your own history and your own, like.  01:07:12.025 --> 01:07:14.025 More detail.  01:07:16.218 --> 01:07:23.218 To remember the facts about. About yourself, and then respond.  01:07:23.016 --> 01:07:34.016 Um, appropriately, you know. Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, I'm almost\u2026 I should be done, um, I guess.  01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:34.139 Yes, definitely. Michael's just throwing the dog up.  01:07:34.526 --> 01:07:42.526 Alright, so\u2026 Alright, what would be, um, ideal interaction between.  01:07:38.276 --> 01:07:40.276 This is a screen I'll open.  01:07:42.457 --> 01:07:48.457 Between Michael and the agent, so a virtual agent like that, who would be helping with.  01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:58.301 You know, maintaining the learnings from this kind of training.  01:07:55.167 --> 01:08:03.167 Well, I noticed that when Michael uses Gemini. He would say things like, um.  01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:09.959 Thank you, and Gemini responds back, you're welcome, that type of thing. And it's more conversational.  01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:17.042 Listen. And, um\u2026 And even with follow-up questions on both ways, whether it's from Michael or from the agent.  01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:15.916 Yes.  01:08:17.195 --> 01:08:22.195 When they were asking about, um. The weather in Africa.  01:08:22.023 --> 01:08:28.023 And Michael said, well, how's about in, you know, Tanzania? He went to the different places, his sister's got.  01:08:22.378 --> 01:08:28.378 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:31.956 And then she\u2026 he said, thank you. She said, you're welcome.  01:08:32.387 --> 01:08:37.387 That makes a difference, I think, because it's just part of a typical conversation.  01:08:35.798 --> 01:08:37.798 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:42.712 Whereas, even with Alexa, he'll say, oh, thank you, Alexa, and there's no response.  01:08:41.403 --> 01:08:43.403 Correct.  01:08:43.254 --> 01:08:50.254 Um, Suri responds back. But\u2026 does Maver respond back to you? Maida doesn't.  01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.256 Yeah.  01:08:49.415 --> 01:08:55.415 Does not. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah.  01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:56.979 Gemini does, and Suri does, but Alexa and the glasses don't say, oh, you're welcome.  01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:07.507 Yeah, and I think, um, the other difference when he was asking about the weather, he\u2026 he asked what's the weather in, um, you know, Tanzania? And then, for the.  01:09:07.574 --> 01:09:24.574 Other two locations, he did not say the whole\u2026 question. It was like, how about in\u2026 you know, Uganda, or how about in Kenya? So, it doesn't even, like, it remembers, like, it contextually remembers what the context was and what he was asking in the.  01:09:24.496 --> 01:09:36.496 Question previously, and then kind of repeats and makes up the context on its own, which, which\u2026 Which is different from how A or S would be, um, in this given situation.  01:09:35.265 --> 01:09:45.265 That's right. And with the person with the TBI. Or\u2026 that's a lot easier, because having to remember a big, long prompt.  01:09:42.827 --> 01:09:44.827 Yeah.  01:09:44.983 --> 01:09:48.983 It's a lot different than being able to have it more like a conversation.  01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:58.320 Yeah. Exactly, yes. All right, well\u2026 That\u2026 that really\u2026 that this is it, actually, yeah. Is there anything else you would like to share with us?  01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:07.045 He's like, I'm done. Can you\u2026 can you just, like, be done now? I'm just so done, right?  01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:15.120 Well, Michael, I just want to say thank you so much for another great summer. You taught us so much about AI.  01:10:11.384 --> 01:10:23.384 Thank you. I feel, yes, the same way. I think, and you've done so well, um, since the past year. I think I see huge, huge, um.  01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:30.393 I mean, I think gains in your skills and your language and your speech, especially, I think it's really wonderful.  01:10:34.968 --> 01:10:54.968 And thanks so much for everything you're doing to support her mom, and we\u2026 cannot do this without you every summer, and we love seeing you all making really great, um, explorations and trying out new things with us, and learning from, um, these new available free tools, and, um, yeah, it's been a great summer.  01:10:35.836 --> 01:10:37.836 What do you say, Michael? Thank you.  01:10:38.962 --> 01:10:39.962 Yeah.  01:10:55.096 --> 01:11:02.096 Um, is there anything, um, like, I'll follow up on the gift card, it got to your email. Um, they'll probably do it in waves.  01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:15.735 Nice. Um, and is there anything else you'd like us to follow up with, or, um, if you're interested in maybe doing more of the lessons in the fall and spring semester, we're planning and thinking about that, because we have a few people on the way.  01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:26.596 Yeah, please keep us in mind, because, um, we're learning a lot from it as well. I mean, truthfully, Alexa has been a godsend for Michael, because it's making him more independent.  01:11:19.824 --> 01:11:21.824 So let's the people that are\u2026  01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:35.325 All of these different technologies and the AI. It is helping Michael become more independent, and it's helping us, kind of.  01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:40.404 Think outside the box as well, and that's been wonderful. So we've truly appreciate.  01:11:44.218 --> 01:11:51.218 Thank you. Michael, we're all done. We'll let you go eat your dinner. Thank you so much for being very patient with us.  01:11:44.807 --> 01:11:47.807 Every time you are offered to us, we really do.  01:11:51.857 --> 01:11:57.857 Thank you so much, we appreciate all your help. Thank you. Bye-bye.  01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:08.890 I go, he's so funny. He's like, I'm funny! Okay, Claire K stopped the recording?  01:12:02.307 --> 01:12:03.307 Aye.   , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today.

Here's a summary:\n\nFunction: The SOAP note serves as a structured method for healthcare providers to document patient encounters in an organized way, providing a framework for evaluating information, diagnosing, and treating patients effectively.\n\nStructure:\n1. Subjective: This section includes the patient's symptoms, history of present illness (HPI), medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, review of systems (ROS), current medications, and allergies.\n2. Objective: This section documents vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n3. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n4. Plan: This section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, therapy needed (medications), specialist referrals, and any other follow-up steps.\n\nIssues of Concern:\n1. Order of information: While the traditional SOAP note follows Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan order, rearranging it to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) may provide quick access to ongoing care information and improve efficiency.\n2. Time integration: The original SOAP model does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap.\n3. Data volume: The shift to electronic documentation has led to the inclusion of large volumes of data, which can burden clinicians if the data are not useful or accurate.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint.

How are you doing, Speaker 3?\n00:00:11 Speaker 3\nI'm doing well because today around half day I went over to my community pool with my dad and we did some treading water and like no water. I'm trying to get back into the pool but like just, you know, it's good for me to be in the water. So. I'm happy because of that. \n00:00:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's really great.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nSo Speaker 6 will be coming in a little bit, so we're going to get started without her. Let me just. Pull up. What I need OK. If you're still trying to fix your computer, I can still give you a minute or I can start. Just let me know when you'r ready.\n00:01:08 Speaker 3\nMaybe you can just start or I can like. Stop video and see what happens, and this is the same so they can move. It's that laptop cameras not working OK. But I can just still listen to you.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 5 is that is that going to be fine? OK. Perfect. OK. Umm, so we were gonna try to look at what we did last week. So last week we were going through and doing playing music or looking at the videos. So I was going to see if you could show me how to play a music or video from your Speaker 7.\n00:02:00 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, I'm Speaker 7. I I just asked her to like go on YouTube and like, play a song and she just. I just do it that way. Just ask for the YouTube video and she plays it when I just say play this.\n00:02:08 Speaker 1\nYeah. So let's see. So last week you were trying to pull up the Olympic ceremonies. I know it was having a difficult time. Did you want to try to pull that up again? Or try something different.\n00:02:40 Speaker 3\nMaybe I'll try to play some music or something.\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:02:45 Speaker 3\nOK, just ask her, OK? Speaker 7. Can you play Banning CA on YouTube.\n00:02:57 Speaker 7\nWhat you need to?\n00:03:13 Speaker 1\nIt's just still searching?\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's playing right now. Like the YouTube is trying to show you on my phone, but. Just playing the song.\n00:03:23 Speaker 1\nSo I can't. I can't hear it, but I last week we worked on turning the volume up and the volume down. Could you try doing that this time?\n00:03:31 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. OK. Speaker 7, can you turn the volume down? Speaker 7, can you turn the sound up?\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n00:03:56 Speaker 3\nCan you stop the video? So it's in there somewhere. I stopped it. Yeah.\n00:04:05 Speaker 1\nOK, great. I think that was easier than last week too.\n00:04:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, because like you know, I've done it most of the times last week. You know, it's indoor rain somewhere, so I can just do it again.\n00:04:22 Speaker 1\nHave you been working on it throughout the week?\n00:04:26 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, like this. I think it was Tuesday we were playing. Like it it like UM. We're listening. I was asking them Speaker 7 to play another song and this it's like I wanted to listen to it and she pulled it up and it's like. Something to getting used to doing.\n00:04:50 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. That's super and that's super useful.\n00:04:54 Speaker 3\nYeah, I know it's new thing is getting part of my routine and saying make her play song and do.\n00:05:05 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Have you have you set it up to the playlist that you made?\n00:05:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, I just ask Speaker 7 like to go on YouTube and like for an artist and just like it just kind of plays some one night for each other. So I'm just, I just go by artist. Yeah.\n00:05:28 Speaker 1\nOK. Great. Today we're going to be talking about self-care needs. So I wanted to find out what type of self-care or health related activity. Do you have difficulties managing?\n00:05:54 Speaker 3\nWell. Trying to think, well, like selfcare is like when they, like tried to. Like she like, want, like, want to look good in the mirror and look at my do my hair and stuff sometimes. Like ohh. My left arm is kind of weaker at this point in our recovery, so my hair up in a ponytail or headband or something. It's like sometimes it's kind of a struggle to get into place.\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:06:27\nYeah.\n00:06:30 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that can? Be a little bit difficult.\n00:06:37 Speaker 3\nWell, I put a lot of lotion on my skin cause I like being in the pool and chlorine eats her skin, so I put it on a lot and so sometimes like I want to put a lot of lotion on and sometimes it gets like your clothes kind of get too lotiony. It's too much on your it's kind of like on your shirt and stuff like. Too much so. So you have to find it in the middle, like too much or too little.\n00:07:11 Speaker 1\nIs it because you squeeze out too much?\n00:07:14 Speaker 3\nI squeeze out too much and then I go there, put this on my face.\n00:07:19 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. And then you have a lot.\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nOf extra. Yeah. So like, I'll put it back in a plastic bag.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nOK. Anything else that self-care related?\n00:07:39 Speaker 3\nI'm well, I'm trying to. Cut down my process. Food in my diet, to where like my eat more like natural food than fruits and grains, and my diet. Not eating like processed food or fast food or like like frozen meals I'm kind of. And make my diet more healthy, so it's good for my overall health. I'm trying to cut those out of my diet.\n00:08:09 Speaker 1\nOK. And and maybe maybe with the food, do you have any technologies or tools? That can help you manage these needs.\n00:08:24 Speaker 3\nWell, I can. Like. Tell my smartphone to. Like. Read me my my shopping list or then say say it to me out loud and so say if I want to go to the grocery store, I want to get that. Not that. So are you gonna get this this this. So it's like in my mind it backs up and ohh I need to shop for this. Then that one too. So I sometimes use that like I need to make a little list in my phone.\n00:09:03 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Like, I mean, yeah, really useful.\n00:09:07 Speaker 3\nI know. Yeah, I like listening everything cause like my background is in science and protocols are all this usually step by step by step.\n00:09:19 Speaker 1\nDo you typically when you're making the list? UM. Do you? Like is it on your computer or? What do you what do you make? Your list on.\n00:09:35 Speaker 3\nOh, on my like my iPhone, there's a little UM notes app, so like if I'm in my in the store I have my phone with me all the time. I don't have a little. I usually get a piece of paper and write it by hand. But if I have it on my phone, out in public, I can just look at it. But. Trying and I can just hold in my hand and look at that. I need to go down the aisle and. Get some milk or something.\n00:10:00 Speaker 1\nAll right, that's great. And then I was wondering, Speaker 3, when you were talking about squeezing out the lotion. Sometimes it squeezes too much. Is that due to weakness? In your arm.\n00:10:14 Speaker 3\nI think it's a combination of. Like weak arm and also how much pressure I can. I'm supposed to use or. I think it's either too much or too little. It's like just. To like round it out, see like. I think it only did like a little squeeze or that I squeeze it too hard. It's like all of it out.\n00:10:37 Speaker 1\nDo you use one hand or two hands?\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nI always use my left hand, it's dominant, but I probably need to use both to too. So in my head I think it's just one hand and I actually need to use 2.\n00:10:52 Speaker 1\nOK. I mean that makes sense. Sometimes I like to use one hand because it seems convenient, but.\n00:10:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, and that's not what I'm supposed to do.\n00:11:03 Speaker 1\nOK. But that's that's good. And that's the way that you can help manage in the future? UM. OK, let's see. So I have something, but I don't know if you take, do you take medications? You don't have to tell me what or any.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nOhh I take medication regularly. I have a little pill case in my bathroom I take I have daily doses to take, yeah.\n00:11:33 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to think of. 10 scenarios to complete this the sentence, so I want to learn to manage my medications. Or slash take care of myself more about. Let's see. So I read the question kind of funny. OK, so I want to learn how to manage my medications or take care of myself more about.\n00:12:28 Speaker 6\nHi. Sorry I'm. I'm so sorry I'm late. I've been commuting to Rancho every single day so. But. Where's Speaker 3?\n00:12:40 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm actually having some camera issues, but I'm here.\n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nOK. Hi, Speaker 3. \n00:12:44 Speaker 3\nHi, Speaker 6. \n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nHello.\n00:12:51 Speaker 1\nWe were just going to try and work on coming up with some sentences about managing our medication or self-care. So is there anything that you want to maybe have to learn to manage medications or anything that you think would help?\n00:13:21 Speaker 3\nWell. I I say I take daily medication for my. I have like dose. I got regular dosage ofpills for like anti seizure meds and  I just need to take them twice daily so maybe I need to put like alarms on my phone for the times it's supposed to go and like oh, I know that that's for that.\n00:13:50 Speaker 1\nOK, so alarms you said two times a day.\n00:13:52 Speaker 3\nYeah, I take one early morning, one late night. Yeah. So I have twice a day pills for anti seizure.\n00:14:00 Speaker 1\nOK. So doing an alarm.\n00:14:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, alarm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nAll right. And then. Are there other things for managing that? There's other aspects besides medication that you think for self-care that maybe you can have something, maybe Speaker 7 help manage?\n00:14:36 Speaker 3\nMaybe like I have like well alarms would be like you know I have physical therapy appointments or speech sessions like maybe I'll ask her to. Like makes me have like. A. A reminder like 30 minutes before or something cause like my PD clinic is like like a couple streets away from my house. So I need to like the little time to get ready.\n00:15:04\nYes.\n00:15:07 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. And then maybe if we're trying to come up with something for uh. Like maybe another thing to help with like if you have your medications for taking besides like just an alarm for time, we could have it set up something about the dosage instructions or potential side effects.\n00:15:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, I could just maybe ask her to do a reminder of like, UM. Check the like when we check the side of the bottle or something like that. So like they have a little medicine like like little fact sheet about what this is for. Yeah. Maybe like right, maybe about like 20 minutes before. I'm just taking this look, look at the side of the bottle or something like that.\n00:16:12 Speaker 1\nDo you is do you always take the same amount of the same medication?\n00:16:18 Speaker 3\nCurrently, but my neurologist, he said in like a week or two he's gonna, like, face out one and switch it with another. So I need to. I'm in like transition right now. So I'm it's like in the next couple weeks I'm going to like switch one out and get a new one.\n00:16:41 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.  So for that one, will the dosage change?\n00:16:48 Speaker 3\nWell, the dosages would change like one postman faced out and then one is building up this new one is. So this is will be going up.\n00:16:57 Speaker 1\nOK. Are you going to take it the same amount of times a day?\n00:17:02 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's both twice a day, but they're on the new pill is higher now and the I'm phasing out the old one that was on SO1 going up, one going down.\n00:17:16 Speaker 1\nAll right, so we could set up something that will because it's going to be a new dosage, maybe to remind you about what dosage to take possibly.\n00:17:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good reminder.\n00:17:33 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that you that could help you manage the medication or manage you know, other aspects of self-care? That we talked about.\n00:17:49 Speaker 3\nWell, I think that those are my 2. Issues in self-care right now, like with this weakness, weakness and like on my left side. But I wanna try to do my hair or put it in a ponytail or back behind my face like I'm trying to do it evenly. But this left side. Not always there. And then taking my daily medication, then sticking to this like the doses aren't supposed to be on right now. And also I'm I'm supposed to be doing daily stretches for my PT clinic to make my body open up. So I think they need to get reminders for that too.\n00:18:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, yeah, that would be great.\n00:18:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because I have a little packet. They gave me a little like, oh, do this one do this one they like. I'm supposed to actually do them. Speaker 7 reminds me of it. OK, you. Need to do it.\n00:18:51 Speaker 1\nSorry, I froze for a second, so I wasn't sure what happened. Go ahead, sorry.\n00:19:12 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's like it was. It was breathing for me. Breaking up for me a little bit. These are great. I just want to make sure we also ask. Sorry, I sorry, I missed the beginning. Have we asked Speaker 3 the goals yet or what her goal is or? Oh, we have, OK.\n00:19:36 Speaker 1\nWhat her goal is?\n00:19:38 Speaker 6\nSo. Yes, so we can. So, Speaker 3, what is your goal with Speaker 7? What do you hope to use Speaker 7 for?\n00:19:51 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm well. Currently I'm trying to do. I have my cell phone having alarms and daily planned activities like, you know, go to the USC election meeting it makes like a little noise and I need to have my Speaker 7 like back her up too or something. Ohh, go to your like tomorrow over at Chapman has Irvine campus. I live in Irvine so I go to PT over there, so about like. 45 minutes before. I just need to go get dressed, so maybe I can have Speaker 7 give me reminders and I'll I'll do this then.\n00:20:32 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:20:34 Speaker 3\nSo I just like how, UM, the Alex. I'm trying to use here right now. It's like I have my alarms and my reminders on my phone but need to have when you have two things telling you what to do is easier.\n00:20:49 Speaker 6\nYes, I think Speaker 7 is a great tool for you, especially when you're at home and it gives you that extra reminder to, you know, tie your hair or check. Yeah. Check. You know, 30 minutes before you have your PT session remind you to get ready. Like, oh, it's time to get ready. Yeah. OK.\n00:21:11 Speaker 3\nI need to get ready and leave. Yeah, because like you know, PT or a different album, there's like a speech that we can wear jeans and a top PD and wear your leggings and your hair in the back and the bun. And like, like fitness shoes. It's like it's different.\n00:21:29 Speaker 6\nTrue, right? OK reminders or?\n00:21:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because my different appointments are different. You need to look different ways.\n00:21:46 Speaker 6\nThat's right. All right. Everything looks great, so I wonder if the other. Groups are done. But yeah, how are how are both your weeks so far?\n00:22:08 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm happy because. Feels like, you know, actual summer like. Kind of hot, but I like it.\n00:22:16 Speaker 6\nYeah, me too. I love the hot, the warm weather. What about you, Speaker 1?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's been great. It does feel like summer's coming to me because. Yeah. Yeah.

That's awesome so. Yeah. Is. Yeah. Speaker 16 is in this in this uh and uh. OK. Yeah. So you're graduating and same same class as me, I guess so, yeah, that's also. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And then Speaker 3, how have you been? Kind of how have your therapy sessions been going?\n00:23:41 Speaker 3\nWell. I do a lot of therapy sessions because I live in Irvine and Chapman University has a Irvine campus for like biotech and like also like nursing school and like speech, SRP's like speech, language and so like I go there for a lot of things and. Well, they're on summer break right with summer session. So it's and like working on my socializing with them like, you know, they're my peers. So I'm just trying to make make my summer like progress towards like socializing with, like, people my own age, like in the future when I return to lab work, like, I'll be around people my own age, so that's my goal right now.\n00:24:23 Speaker 6\nWell, that's awesome. I love that, good goals to work towards. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go back to the main room so we can learn some more skills about medication, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:25:23 Speaker 4\nAlright, if thank everyone's back, I'm going to share my screen again and we're going to practice a couple and then we'll go back into our breakout rooms. OK so. It's going to be a two-part command, but first we're going to use our Lexa to create a medication list for the sake of practicing as a group. We can do like a over the counter medication like by Advil or Tylenol as practice. So does anyone want to go first?\n00:26:09 Speaker 8\nWell, I can do it. Speaker 13. Give me a. Tell. Naproxen. Pill.\n00:26:25 Speaker 13\nAre you trying to shop for Naproxen pill?\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nYes.\n00:26:32 Speaker 13\nOne moment. Showing results from Naproxen Pill. The first one is Amazon Basic care back and muscle pain. Naproxen Sodium tablets, 220 milligrams, 90 count.\n00:26:50 Speaker 8\nOK, they. She wants me to pick up that naproxen pill, so that's good. I I can. Maybe I didn't. Tell our ask. Properly. I'll do it again.\n00:27:17 Speaker 4\nAnd Speaker 8, the there is an example on the right here. So say the wake up word and then create my medication list and then you could use that medication name you just mentioned.\n00:27:30 Speaker 8\nOK. Speaker 7. Create my. Medication list. And I want it. On. Not.\n00:27:46 Speaker 7\nCreate a list called medication right?\n00:27:51 Speaker 4\nIt picked up. Yep, he dropped it, picked up the first command. So we created the list. So now as a follow up you could add that name.\n00:27:51 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 7.\n00:28:01 Speaker 13\nRight.\n00:28:02 Speaker 8\nRight. Give me an aspirin. How's that?\n00:28:09 Speaker 13\nI've created medication list. What would you like to add to it?\n00:28:14 Speaker 8\nAspirin.\n00:28:17 Speaker 13\nI've added aspirin to your medication list. What else?\n00:28:26 Speaker 8\nCough drops.\n00:28:30 Speaker 13\nI've added cough drops to your medication list.

So it will ask those follow up questions just like that. And then how you responded when you added those specific examples? It's a great job, OK. Does anyone want to go next in creating their medication list?\n00:28:59 Speaker 2\nI will go. Speaker 14, create my medication list. Compounded hormones. Heart medication. Supplements. Sleep. I have all these medication profiles. Compounded hormones. R DHEA. Thyroid. Progesterone, estrogen cream, testosterone cream.\n00:29:43 Speaker 4\nDid did it pick up? The command did anything come up on the screen when you said that? OK, so how about first let's try that again. Let's first create that medication list.\n00:29:53 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, create my medication list.\n00:30:06 Speaker 14\nCreate a list called medication, right? Yes.

It has the same screen.\n00:31:18 Speaker 4\nYou could try that again. Say the wake up wake word and then say I'm all done. Maybe see if that.\n00:31:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, all done now.\n00:31:29 Speaker 14\nI'm not sure.\n00:31:32 Speaker 4\nOr how about?\n00:31:33 Speaker 2\nAll done now. Creating medication. Lists. Speaker 14's all done now.\n00:31:47 Speaker 14\nSorry, I'm not sure.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:31:51 Speaker 4\nOK, say the wake wake word again. Say go home.\n00:31:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, go home. It the screen turned off.\n00:32:06 Speaker 4\nDid it turn off? Yes. OK, so it's back. Do you see the main display again now? Yes, OK. Perfect.

Speaker 1, I can share my I can share the screen and then do you want to go ahead and? Should we go through the commands? So let me share my screen real quick. Oh.\n00:40:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, because I have the slides cause I.\n00:40:30 Speaker 6\nYou have the slides. Do you mind sharing? Can you share them? Because I don't have permission at the moment. Or I can ask Speaker 5.\n00:40:42 Speaker 1\nIt's saying that I can.\n00:40:45 Speaker 6\nOhh share screen OK. Yes you can. OK perfect.\n00:40:50 Speaker 6\nOK. \nAnd then I will note, oh, are you just OK?\n00:40:53 Speaker 1\nIt won't let me. Yeah, because I'm disabled too.\n00:40:58 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, if you're sending reminders, that's one of the things that you mentioned earlier, Speaker 3.\n00:41:09 Speaker 3\nThat to make it ohh I need this need to be ready for this in like 45 minutes or something to like flash on my screen. I'll need to get ready for PT or something.\n00:41:25 Speaker 6\nYes. Should we try that? Speaker 3, do you want to try that right now and set a a, maybe a reminder. So let's do. Do you want to do 30 minutes before your PT session?\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right, so. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder for 12:00 PM tomorrow for PT in an half hour?\n00:41:53 Speaker 7\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:41:56 Speaker 3\n12:00 PM.\n00:41:59 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at noon.\n00:42:04 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nAlright, I did it. Yeah, it says.\n00:42:09 Speaker 4\nNice.\n00:42:12 Speaker 3\nFriday, August 2nd at noon. So I have to get ready for. PC at that time.\n00:42:19 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:42:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:42:23 Speaker 6\nYeah. So the PT session starts at 12:30.\n00:42:26 Speaker 3\nWell, it's they want me there around like. So it actually starts at 12:45, but it's nice like they give myself 1/2 an hour to get ready and the only out of the door by 12:30. So like.\n00:42:39 Speaker 6\nOh. Ohh good.\n00:42:41 Speaker 3\nWhenever the you know the clinicians have to be there on time at to meet them at the door. So say I need a little time.\n00:42:48 Speaker 6\nYeah, good. I love how you already strategized and kind of gave yourself enough time to get ready and yeah, you.\n00:42:57 Speaker 3\nIt's good for me to plan. I need time for that. Customers like. Well PT like. You have to. Well, I try to look presentable because it's PT you wear, like your sweats and like, not really that attractive but like. I want to look like. You know, athleisure, it's like kind of like trendy workout plans, but but that is because they, they know that a team of clinicians are my peers. So I want to look fashionable in my own head.\n00:43:30 Speaker 6\nOhh yeah. Well, that's always. Yeah. I mean it's always, I mean you feel better too if you kind of like, yeah, absolutely.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's confidence. Yeah, I'm going to do this and like, I need half an hour to get ready.\n00:43:45 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know. Women, we need our time to get ready.\n00:43:51 Speaker 3\nIf you need your time and like you know, I have to put my hair up in a ponytail. That. Looks. No straight line behind my head because like you know, sometimes those PT clinicians comes and just put you on your back on the pad. It's like you wanna hang your hair out of the way?\n00:44:07 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. Speaker 3, I can see you already thinking about. Everything and you, you have all your outfits for different therapy sessions. I like that you're very organized. You're very.\n00:44:18 Speaker 3\nI'm really organized. I'm I'm a scientist, so I can think everything has to be. It's categorizing. Everything has a box to stick it.\n00:44:27 Speaker 6\nI love that. OK. All right. Let's go back to our slide. All right. I think we are on this one. OK. All right. Go ahead, Speaker 1, we can kind.\n00:44:44 Speaker 1\nOK, sure. So kind of like the the alarm you just set, this one's going to be specific for the medication like the medication you mentioned for that you take for seizures, yeah. So you can try that command. They wrote it up here and you can try it with that medication.\n00:45:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Speaker 7. Remind me to take Keppra at 7:00 AM.\n00:45:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that was good. That was like my morning dose. Yeah, it's on there, it says.\n00:45:35 Speaker 1\nOK, good. And you can do the same thing?\n00:45:38 Speaker 3\nFor the night dose, yeah. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder? For taking my my nightly medicine Keppra at 7:00 PM. 7:00 PM.\n00:46:03 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 7:00 PM.\n00:46:09 Speaker 3\nWell, it seems like she has both. Of them now.\n00:46:12 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great.\n00:46:15 Speaker 3\nYeah. If I say if I string it like word by word, she had to follow it like that.\n00:46:22 Speaker 1\nThat's OK. Yeah. Sometimes the way we say it, she'll she'll want us to say it in a specific way, but that's good. So now you two alarm set for every day.\n00:46:34 Speaker 3\nYeah, every day. Yeah.\n00:46:37 Speaker 1\nOK, great.\n00:46:38 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:43 Speaker 6\nShould we move on to the next one? Let's try this one.\n00:46:53 Speaker 1\nOK, so this one when we you need to find an over the counter medication so you can if you're trying to look for a specific medication, you can ask Speaker 7 where to find that medication so. What medication would you want to find?\n00:47:16 Speaker 3\nProbably would like to find like Tylenol like pain reliever like. Maybe I\u2019ll just command her.\n00:47:25 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:47:25 Speaker 3\nOh, OK, Speaker 7. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:47:34 Speaker 7\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy, who is 6 miles away on campus Drive and 1:50 right in. .7 miles away on Culver Drive, Urban Medical Center pharmacy 6.3 miles away on 7th Ave. St. 101 you can ask me for things like what's the address for the first one?\n00:48:04 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options where I can buy it.\n00:48:09 Speaker 6\nNice, I know. And she even read you the addresses.\n00:48:12 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's like, well, I've gone to that one before. It's like right down the street from my house.\n00:48:17 Speaker 6\nOh, good. She's pretty accurate, right? Yeah.\n00:48:21 Speaker 3\nI like how she's like spot on because like, my brain is analytical like that. So I can I like how she sticks to it.\n00:48:30 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK, great. Well, yeah that I think that's really helpful that way. You know if you know that you can't have to go to a close one, then she tells you how far it. Is so then you can the one that. It's close.\n00:48:50 Speaker 3\nOr like sometimes I go to like. I mean, I'm going to like a session now, I guess like my PT clinic is on the right and that one right there is on the route just to get it on the way or something like that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that would be super, super helpful.\n00:49:07 Speaker 3\nYou know, because like, well sometimes like. They make me work at PT, so maybe on the way back I need to get. Some Tylenol.\n00:49:18 Speaker 6\nNice.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nSo, Speaker 3, do you do your laundry?\n00:49:24 Speaker 3\nI do, but I I just took time. I've been right now I don't have a lot right now, but sometimes like, well, I have a little bin. If it's full, I can do one little. But it's only about like half full right now, so. I usually when my bin is full, I can stick it in. It's like 1 load per bin so.\n00:49:46 Speaker 1\nOK. Do you just wait till it gets full or do you do it? You know, once a week or once a month or.\n00:49:55 Speaker 3\nI usually rely on my bin like cause it's a size about like one load and usually I have. It's just like I usually label everything is like color like colors and cotton cause like it washes everything even though something so like. Different kinds of fabric. When you wash it all together, I have like a dyed a towel with a cut, cut, cut color in it. I have white underwear. They get dyed.\n00:50:30 Speaker 1\nSo do you read it?\n00:50:32 Speaker 3\nYes, and I use separate and then also I do my sheets once a month like the sheets in my bed. So I have to do that load by itself like with like a hot wash like hot temperature because like. It's cotton and it it kills like stuff on my bed and needs to get it. Clean.\n00:50:54 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, that's great. OK. So this one, the first step is how to do laundry. So I know you do your own laundry, but we can ask Speaker 7 and see how Speaker 7 says to do laundry.\n00:51:09 Speaker 3\nOK, I\u2019ll try. OK Speaker 7. How do I do my laundry? She gave me a couple. Then you click on or maybe select number one.\n00:51:32 Speaker 4\nThanks.\n00:51:37 Speaker 3\nOK, so Speaker 7 select number 1.\n00:51:44 Speaker 7\nFrom nearly dark 18. To give stretch things out of white clothing, use a one to one ratio of dish soap, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, and enough water to soak. A shallow bucket works well. Once the item is soaked for 30 minutes, washer is usually when you're ready to do laundry, zip it and tossing the load.\n00:52:11 Speaker 3\nWell, she just read to me about how to. Wash UM sweat stains out of UM like white clothing and using like a a combo of baking soda and and soap and hydrogen peroxide. Different like ratios and you say? Ohh stick it in.\n00:52:32 Speaker 1\nThat's really helpful.\n00:52:33 Speaker 3\nYou know, it's like, well, it's really I liked how it's really different like you know, when you have a scientific procedure different like it's like different parts of it like you have got the whole like procedures, then you have the the beginning, this and this and this it is scientific.\n00:52:59 Speaker 6\nI love that. It's all, it's all like analogy, right? They're all analogy, yeah.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nOK, so I was thinking that we could try to set a reminder for to do it at a specific time because you do your sheets once a month. Maybe you can have Speaker 7. You can pick a date and then just have Speaker 7 tell you on that date.\n00:53:30 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:53:33 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7. Can you set a reminder for me to do my laundry on August 15th?\n00:53:43 Speaker 7\nWhat time should I remind you?\n00:53:49 Speaker 3\n8:00 AM.\n00:53:51 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for August 15th at 8:00 AM.\n00:53:57 Speaker 3\nWell, she just made a reminder for me, she said. 8:00 AM on August. August 15th, halfway through the month, and. I have no appointments during that early morning time.\n00:54:13 Speaker 1\nOh, perfect.\n00:54:14 Speaker 3\nIt worked for my schedule.\n00:54:18 Speaker 1\nThat's great.\n00:54:22 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 3, on the Speaker 7 screen, does it say laundry as the name of the reminder or? Maybe you can ask Speaker 7 to. Show you your reminders. Alright? Yeah.\n00:54:43 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7, can you show me my reminders?\n00:54:55 Speaker 6\nDo you? Do you see one that says laundry on August 15th, or it's just a blank?\n00:55:00 Speaker 3\nIt's no, it's there's a bunch of them, so it says on August 15th. Do my laundry 8:00 AM and then. And. So every Thursday at like 520 prepare for Trojan space and then. Friday. Tomorrow it says. Half an hour PT, so it's 12:00 PM. Half an hour. That's like a reminder and then. I have my dosage. For taking my meds in the morning and night time, so I think there's about. Looks like there's about six things in the reminder list for me now. So I'm happy.\n00:56:00 Speaker 6\nThat's awesome. And you did them all. Yeah, I think you.\n00:56:05 Speaker 3\nWe may have a step by step. It's easier for me to think that way.\n00:56:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, you set them all up very nicely. Very good. OK, next one.\n00:56:18 Speaker 1\nOK, so we can do the stains out. You kind of did that one when you asked how they did the laundry, she kind of told you how to get. The stains out. Maybe we can try the one about fabric softener.\n00:56:40 Speaker 3\nUhm, OK, I'll try the command, OK. Hey. Speaker 7. When do I use fabric softener?\n00:56:59 Speaker 7\nEvery cycle, but it is usually recommended to use it every few washes.\n00:57:06 Speaker 3\nWow, she just told me that. It's used in every cycle or. Can we rotate it like recommended every two or? Every, every other wash and. Every like and as needed. So to add your fabric softener thing. It's like kind of your own choice you do you need it or you can just let it go.\n00:57:31 Speaker 1\nOh, OK. Do you use fabric softener?\n00:57:41 Speaker 3\nYes, if like the item we're trying to wash. Can be kind of like like stretched out. So I need to make it. So some things need to be a little crisp anywhere.\n00:57:57 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Let's try the next one. OK, so this one. So if your head's really hurting and you have a headache or a migraine. We can try to ask Speaker 7 how to how do we would treat that.\n00:58:20 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK, cool. Speaker 7, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:58:29 Speaker 7\nThere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for migraine food applying ice packs to the back of the head with temple taking and not taking a warm shower or bath inside, drinking water resting, and with physical therapy.\n00:58:52 Speaker 3\nOhh, she just read off things to do. You have migraine symptoms and different techniques you can do like put ice on the back of your neck or go to PT clinic and. Like soothe yourself.\n00:59:09 Speaker 1\nDo you ever get migraines?\n00:59:12 Speaker 3\nI actually do not get migraines.\n00:59:15 Speaker 1\nOK, good.\n00:59:17 Speaker 3\nBut some people do. It's like a lot of people.\n00:59:21 Speaker 1\nYeah, those are good ways to help if you if you do get migraines. But even if you get a headache they might help.\n00:59:26 Speaker 3\nYeah, like it's good to like. Like sometimes you just want to like, listen to some chill music and just. Check out.\n00:59:39 Speaker 5\nYeah, that could help too.\n00:59:41 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like when they're doing a lot of other things with my day, sometimes you have to take a break.\n00:59:50 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's really helpful. OK. Should we try another one? OK, this one's for stomach pains, OK.\n00:59:58 Speaker 3\nI'll try, OK. Speaker 7. What do I take for stomach pains?\n01:00:08 Speaker 7\nI don't know that one.\n01:00:12 Speaker 3\nHe just said. I don't know that one.\n01:00:20 Speaker 1\nWell, let's see. So what? What is something we could take for stomach pain? There's medicine like.\n01:00:31 Speaker 3\nLike anti acid or something like that like so everyone has different pains.\n01:00:38 Speaker 1\nI think wasn't there when you put on your medication list.\n01:00:41 Speaker 3\nOhh, like Tylenol? Like a pain med.\n01:00:45 Speaker 7\nInteractive adventures with character.\n01:00:47 Speaker 1\nOr Pepto bismol.\n01:00:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, Pepto bismol.\n01:00:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, that I think might have been on that list too. So we could read the list off of like medications that you would take. Help remember.\n01:01:06 Speaker 3\nYeah. Speaker 7, can you read me my medication list?\n01:01:19 Speaker 7\nI don't know.\n01:01:21 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just read it to me. Pepto Bismol and Tylenol.\n01:01:29 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.\n01:01:31 Speaker 3\nShe she read it.\n01:01:34 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Should we try one more?\n01:01:41 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n01:01:43 Speaker 1\nOK, so for this one it says finding a specific healthcare provider, so we could probably tell Speaker 7 what kind of doctor give a like, what kind of doctor would you want to find?\n01:01:56 Speaker 3\nI'm probably a good dentist, so you specific Doctor. OK, I command her OK. Speaker 7. Find me a dentist.\n01:02:13 Speaker 7\nFound a few options for them. It was Spring Hills Dentistry 5.6 miles away on Newport, Dr. Irving Children's Dentistry 2.7 miles away on Culver, Dr. E University Park Dental 4.1 miles away on university.\n01:02:35 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options for different choices for dental care in my area. Even though I think my dentist is farther farther away but it's just good to read those options to.\n01:02:49 Speaker 1\nYeah. And I think if you asked her again, she could like to find more. She could umm, search, search for more. Yeah. Or if you, I think search for your dentist. She could probably tell you where that is too.\n01:03:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. We will try to ask. Speaker 7. Can you? Look for Irvine dental.\n01:03:20 Speaker 7\nFound in Irvine Dental. Irvine Dental was 4.8 miles away.\n01:03:25 Speaker 3\nI just found it.\n01:03:29 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just wrote me the address and. It just said it's currently closed because it actually stops at six and it says, well, it gave me the address and the suite where it's at so. I go there sometimes, like every couple months, so if I need to like check up or. I have a cavity. I don't like that, but it sends you to get it pulled. \n01:03:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense. Well, that's great. And next time you go, maybe you can use Speaker 7 to help with the address and have the address\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like, well, when my mom drives somewhere, I can just plug it into her like. She puts her little. Map thing and Google Maps and just type in the address and go.\n01:04:22 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's great.\n01:04:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n01:04:37 Speaker 6\nThose are all the commands. And Speaker 3, you did them with 100% accuracy, so that was great.\n01:04:43 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n01:04:51 Speaker 6\nOK, I think we are good to go back to the main room. OK, OK.\n01:05:02 Speaker 5\nOK, I'm going to stop the breaker room. Good job. Nice work, Speaker 3. I really feel like you can utilize this on top of everything that you've been using.\n01:05:13 Speaker 3\nI have my phone alarms and now have my Speaker 7 back it up, yeah.\n01:05:19 Speaker 5\nFeel free to pick your preferred ones because we don't want you to fully cover and drop what you've been doing. OK? Yeah, just pick what's easy for you.\n01:05:21 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:05:34 Speaker 5\nHi everyone.\n01:05:42 Speaker 5\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will. Be oh, I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slides a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So I expect another homework for this week on self-care information. Just just to double check, did you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two? You got all the slides. I know, Speaker 8. You got it, Speaker 10. You got it. OK, Speaker 2, you got it too.\n01:06:21 Speaker 8\nYep.\n01:06:25 Speaker 2\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n01:06:34 Speaker 5\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Laura, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our PowerPoint train. OK, so after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be any time, but if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd the. So think week six if you go by numbers in your head. Week six, we would like to hear from you just. We will ask you some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well. You can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share together because. Chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel feel free to bring them as well. And I will send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n01:08:17 Speaker 8\nOK.\n01:08:18 Speaker 7\nAny questions?\n01:08:20 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8, we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 8, if you still wanted to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and then we'll let you go. I promise.\n01:08:32 Speaker 5\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can be brief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday. Bye.\n01:08:52 Speaker 9\nAll right, Speaker 8, I'm going to open the breakout.\n01:08:54 Speaker 5\nRoom. OK. Oh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 8 and Speaker 11 and Speaker 12 can go. And don't forget to record.\n01:09:04 Speaker 6\nOK.\n01:09:06 Speaker 8\nYou want me to join or not?\n01:09:08 Speaker 5\nYes, Speaker 8, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going to change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Speaker 16.\n01:09:30 Speaker 6\nYay, great job. OK, stop.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  The provided text discusses the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, a widely used method of documentation in healthcare that helps structure and organize information for healthcare providers.\n\nThe SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record. The four headings of a SOAP note are:\n\n1. Subjective - This section documents the patient's personal views or feelings about their condition, known as the chief complaint (CC) and history of present illness (HPI). It also includes medical, surgical, family, social history, and review of systems (ROS).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes the subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including any necessary medications, specialist referrals or consults, and patient education.\n\nThe text also discusses issues of concern regarding the SOAP note, such as its inability to document changes over time and the potential for data-filled notes to burden healthcare providers if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy-to-find places, making it easier for clinicians to follow.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file  Session 2 R.T. (News & Facts) 7-10-2025.m4a    Speaker 1: RT  Speaker 2: Clinician  Speaker 3: Clinician  Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  So I'm just. For my like my like state of mind, summertime is like keep on going.  00:00:13 Speaker 3  Can you all hear me? OK, I want to make sure my Wi-Fi is also stable. I don't know what happened. Has a little glitch. Perfect. I'm going to share the slides here and then R, just double checking. Did you start creating a free Google Gemini account yet?  00:00:37 Speaker 1  I think I did, but I don't think it's. I probably. I don't think I actually finished it, but I'll do it later or something.  00:00:43 Speaker 3  OK. Why don't you go open your browser and then go through Google Gemini so we can get this ready and what we can do is I'm going to go through some content. And you can try to explore some of this information on Google using the Gemini AI and for the rest of you all you are more than welcome to try it together, because one thing we'll learn about assisted technology or AI assisted. Tools for therapy is we all need to learn some basic competency about how to use this so. R, even though we're kind of like teaching you and working with you to help you, we're also learning this ourselves.  00:01:30 Speaker 1  OK.  00:01:31 Speaker 3  If you remember, we learned about news and facts and communication using Alexa last summer. Do you remember? What are some of your popular comments? Like you are doing and using with Alexa on this topic.  00:01:46 Speaker 1  Uh. I was like, you know, I'd say alarm wake up or I put a reminder in like I got PT top of the hour. So it's like I usually it's like another alarm clock.  00:02:00 Speaker 3  Yeah, from what I'm hearing, it seems like you're doing a lot of these for a reminder and scheduling so news and are very different. Let me show you some examples. OK, so these are the things you are curious about, for example. Two weeks ago we did a design session or like R, if you were to go to AI tools and a website that tells you about everything you want to know, what would you like to do? And I believe you worked on something like like research and chemistry like you looked up. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about that?  00:02:40 Speaker 1  And I was trying to. Ask like I think it was Jim and I are like one of them. I was like, can you can you like tell me tell me about like specific instrument in the laboratory like different parts of. I think I think it was like a thermocycler, like a machine that like, makes different temperatures for like PCR machine. It's like temperature for like every action to happen. And if I if I hear the steps one more time before I start like a procedure at my volunteer lab position and through my Alexi, I wake up and hear it before. So when I go over to laugh and say ohh I can remember it so I can do it right there. So it just gives a little review before start of my day.  00:03:33 Speaker 3  Yeah. So it sounds like before you start your day, you wanted to kind of have like a assistant to her. With key things to remember, steps to follow. So this is something AI is really good at. And then like I know those of you who are in the call, if you log on Gemini, you want to take a look at some of these commands. We're going to all explore this together. OK. So some of the things. It could be like what you're saying, like the weather, because you need to get ready to head to work the calendar events, the dates and destinations and new reports, news reports like about what's going on. Out there, these are mostly done previously on your Alexa, so the reason why this summer both you and Michael picked to use Gemini is that's another AI tools that you 2 feel the quality of the content is pretty good. Thing is you can't take this. On Gemini a. On your phone and you can use this outside your home. What I think it's also helpful is you are a pretty heavy Google user. So what you've been doing like your Google Calendar, like looking up information syncing. So I'd like you to play with some of that. OK and. Know that some of these AI tools may not have the most up-to-date information. So when you think about asking the AI you wanted to come up with some. Time sensitive prompts or information, so to speak, so you can ask Lexa. Ask Gemini just the right amount of information so just some ideas so let's maybe try something that oopsie. Let's try to think about one thing you're curious about, OK? What is something you wanted to know? More information. Like you can think about just along the line of, like going to work or other things.  00:05:43 Speaker 1  Maybe like there could be like a current like news event that like wanted to like learn some back information like I just looked the other day. There's like a big like flooding event in Texas. And I was like, I'll check that out but like maybe it's for like. In my like to talk to me about in the morning to update me about like current events.  00:06:06 Speaker 3  Yeah. So there are some current events that may happen like you wish to stay on top of the news and facts and information, right? One is related to weather, but it's also natural disaster and then? In we I know in it didn't really like happen here in California, but few months ago early in the January, we had mountain fires down here in Los Angeles. So we sometimes just love to stay on top of this information and it's critical for not only just staying top of news. Also critical for safety purposes. Let's get clarified.  00:06:47 Speaker 1  You know, safety if there's fire. Like we're going off the freeway up to like, like the the valley up in LA. Like if there's a fire, some of those freeways, like the 210 or something like shut off. There's like, how do I do that?  00:07:04 Speaker 3  Yeah. So we don't know how much information Gemini has. That's up to date. We're going to explore that together, OK. And if you want, we can even compare the answers about the same question on prompt from Alexa and also look at the Gemini AI's response and see how well they perform. So let's stay with that topic about. There is a natural disaster. Flooding happening in Texas. Yes. So knowing that, sorry, I think I went backward. Whoopsie. If we want to know about these pieces of information, how we do this previously was we go online or if you subscribe to like a new source, it could be an app on your phone like there's a news feed. You get notifications sometimes or you watch the TV, or you listen to the radio station on the car. So there's some possible channels you can find those information. So with this type of design and information, you need to think about what you're going to ask so you can think about specific query or like a long question prompt to ask the AI or Alexa. So let's practice. How would you ask Alexa about this specific information? I don't know if you have Alexa on if you want to bring it and then like put it next to your face so we can see. Do you want to try to ask Alexa about this particular event and see what you can get?  00:08:40 Speaker 1  Alright so. Trying to think of. Where are you? What are we? Ask her so. Trying to say like. How I format my question? Alexa. What about the what is happening in Texas and the floods?  00:09:48 Alexa  This morning. 6 fittings after the damage still tough to fathom. They can. It feels hard. I just talked everything in my mind and I say I want. To help while the death toll continues to rise, Braxton Garments High School, confirming the rising sophomore, died in the catastrophic flooding. His sister Felicity still missing while the family of eight-year old Mary Kate Jacoby says she's entered the gates of Heaven, calling her tiny but mighty. And full of love. The recent numbers reported break my heart. And they break the fart. Briefing officials now facing tough questions on why flood warnings from the National Weather Service were communicated more widely. This incident will be reviewed. You have my word records from a Kern County meeting in 2016 showing former commissioner said the flood warning. Mr. was pretty antiquated, calling it marginal at the best. What's the biggest reason that these systems have not gone into place? At this point, you know. And UM. I was in an office during those discussions, and frankly, I'm more focused on the future in the past. Meanwhile, the grim search for the missing entering another tough day. It's a hostile environment, is what we call it. Everything is moved and shifted, disaster specialist Larry Minor and his team, including horses and search dogs. Working round the clock determined to provide greeted families some kind of resolution. Stay until we get it done and we want them back up here. And those search. Crews tell me their work is really just beginning as they navigate these remote stretches of the Guadalupe River. In the meantime, city leaders here in Carville, Tammy, they are heartened by these special session called for by Texas Governor Greg Abbott. I'm on some of some of the key topics that are planning to be discussed. The emergency communication systems, those warning sirens that could go off whenever rivers. River levels rise during a flash flood as well as much needed relief funding for this entire area. All right, Morgan, thank you. And a reminder, if you're looking for ways to support the flood victims in Texas, you can find them on our website, today.com.    00:12:13 Speaker 3  So, R, since we can't see your screen and it seems like you watched a little video. Oh, you're pausing, Alexa? Yeah.  00:12:27 Speaker 1  She is what she gave me a little video update like like like Natural Disaster over in Texas. And it was like, good to be up to date on that information. It was someone. You know, ask me about my opinion or brings it up. I have some more back info because I just asked her. About it, yeah.  00:12:47 Speaker 3  It's great. So can you quickly summarize what the news information tell you and if you were to maybe like share this again back to Michael because he may be interested in what news and facts you explored, how would you quickly summarize what was going on so he can?Also look up. On his system.  00:13:11 Speaker 1  I just learned that. In like I remember this, one of the counties over in Texas, that massive flooding from the out of the Guadalupe River and all these. Residents were looking for the families and a lot of people disappeared and people were on horses and like surveillance dogs in the whole region like. Like a really a lot of people are devastated. That's why I learned about.  00:13:44 Speaker 3  That's a great summary. R, would you be interested in seeing what a web-based AI tool is sharing and showing about the similar events and information? I asked Lori to kindly prepare something for us on her and Gemini. So I'm going to stop share and let her show you. Some of the responses before. There is the prompt, so if you see the text box here, you'll probably remember the layout of these type of light. This is where she entered. Tell me about the flooding events in Texas.  00:14:18 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, OK, so R. Look at all this text. Wow. There is a lot of information to take in and it's a little bit different than hearing it on Alexa. The visual signal is a little bit different, right? And I noticed that Doctor do asked you if you could summarize and one thing that I wanted to teach you or point out that what we could do with this big amount of this large amount of text is. Summarized right. So we're getting a lot of information. So maybe we can say. Please summarize. What do you think, R? Three key points, or one paragraph or what would be easiest for you? Do you think?  00:15:15 Speaker 1  Like 3 key points because I like bullet points, so point, yeah.  00:15:18 Speaker 2  Yeah, me too. Yeah, you're a scientist. Love those bullet points, right? Please summarize in three key so key facts, R.    00:15:31 Speaker 1  Yeah, packs. Yeah.  00:15:32 Speaker 2  3 facts with bullet points, right. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's see what we get. So we got this large amount of tax, large amount of information.   00:15:48 Speaker 1  A lot.  00:15:54 Speaker 2  We just modified our prompt. OK, so let's see what we've got here. What do you think? It's still pretty.   00:16:03 Speaker 1  It's. Large, but it's it's more condensed.  Speaker 2  So you think so one week. So do you want to have? Well, let's do you want to like maybe summarize a little bit more?  00:16:14 Speaker 1  Yes, we can ask her for summarized version of this.  00:16:18 Speaker 2  Summarize, summarize each bullet in what do you think one or two sentences?   Speaker 1  Yeah,   Speaker2:  One or two?  Speaker 1:   One  Speaker 2  OK. Let's see what we. Get.  00:16:39 Speaker 2  Well, not bad. What do you think?  00:16:43 Speaker 1  Yeah. That's why it's distinct. I like when it's better to straight to the point like that so.  00:16:48 Speaker 2  OK. Should we ask for more? Like more, you know, more condensed condensation condensed sentences.  00:16:57 Speaker 1  Well, I think it's a good amount for me, but maybe other more small, but I think it's.  00:17:00 Speaker 2  OK. Good.  00:17:02 Speaker 1  Good for me.  00:17:04 Speaker 2  OK what I noticed. Also R is that. The the key facts seem to be bolded.  00:17:13 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:17:13 Speaker 2  Just kind of helpful, I think interesting, yeah. Yeah, because we didn't ask Gemini to do that, but.  00:17:21 Speaker 1  Did that so it's like helpful that way like think it's important, but like she just emphasized it.  00:17:32 Speaker 2  Yeah, I think I think that made it easier to for the information to be scanned visually.  00:17:38 Speaker 1  Yeah, you just see it like that. First one's like people missing like. You think what happened?  00:17:50 Speaker 2  Now, how would you compare that to what you heard on Alexa?  00:17:56 Speaker 1  And I see it visually only a couple bullet points like that it's more. I'm a visual learner so I see it like that it's more. Easy for me to process and like she just says a long paragraph at me. I'm just like what?  00:18:17 Speaker 2  Yeah, good point. Some people are visual learners and some people are auditory learners. Probably, right?  00:18:24 Speaker 1  I'm visual.  00:18:30 Speaker 3  So with this content, R can you? Practice summarizing this key event about the flooding in Texas. Like try not to read the whole text verbatim. You did such a summarizing from the video, which is a a media form and now we're giving you just the plain writing and actually added more details like how many people actually. Which I didn't hear you mentioned that in the previous version of. The quick new. Do you want to retell the key event one more time with some detailed information?  00:19:12 Speaker 1  Alright so. Recently there was a devastating flash flood in Hill Country in Texas and almost like one in 120 people. That are missing and then this historic girls camp has been like. There's a lot of missing campers and. Some of those, like the staff there is not here anymore and a lot of people think this is. Like this? Major flooding could be like low damage in local waterways, so it was really. Like. I'm trying over next to you really. They're really deadly for all these different people in the area and could have been for the ecosystem too, so. It was. A tragedy.  00:20:25 Speaker 3  That's a great summary, R. What? I'm going to ask Laurie to do now is have her copy this three bullet text in the chat box so that you can go to, like, maybe open up a Word document. And then, like, read, massage, reward some of these when we go back to the main room. After we're done with this section of the learning, I'd like you to report back to Michael and tell him. Well, I had some news prepared for you. Here's my news report for today, OK. So that's a hallmark based on what you remember from the video because you saw a lot of like dialogue and then like the lived experiences from the people being interviewed on news and then like a quick summary, these are two different types of information and we're exposed to both types of information all the time to. Remember these key events. So Lori, if you can stop screen share and then drop that in the chat, we'll have you spend some time working on that for a few minutes before we go on to the next one. OK, R, you got the text from.  00:21:49 Speaker 1  I I copied it so you put it on a little Word document again. If you do it again.  00:21:57 Speaker 3  And L, please save this and then we'll put it in a soap note document. Maybe I can open that up real quick. Let me do that as we're speaking. OK, I'm just going to drop this to my clinicians as a private message. This is the soap note document for today. We can add. And here we go. OK. So while R is working on her quick homework assignment. For the clinicians. If you wanted to like again get on Google Gemini, create a quick account if you want to show a demo, we'll use your demo for the next round of questions, OK. OK.So next I wanted to share. I'm trying to find my thing. OK, we talked about news. OK. Can you all see my my screen with this blue color? Yeah, so. Perfect. So one thing about information seeking is we want to know like under what contacts people tend to like, ask these questions whether it's Alexa, these personal assistants or voice assistants or go online, go to Internet or ask your caregivers. Doctors there are a lot of things we can ask for. It could be medically related to your appointment, your therapy, knowing how much exercise you need to work on. So I'd like you to think about the next prompt or thought bubble or thinking ideas you can brainstorm. And this time I want you to try and asking our AI tool what are something around you that you're interested in learning. This could be like. The people in the community, or it could be the geographic location in southern. Yeah. Or it could be like temporal time related, like what's happening in the summer. You mentioned, it feels like summer is really coming there, probably interesting events. I want you to think about a couple of these and what we're going to do is the same business as usual. Some of these prompts you can ask Alexa because Alexa has your like location because it's location based, things you ask Alexa could be can you provide me with some latest or local or international news? This is probably something you're getting from your daily flash debriefing. I know you have that in place. Maybe we can ask Alexa and then we'll try the same with the Gemini to see if we're getting different type of news and feed recommendation. The reason why I want to show you this is you're not asking a specific factual. A specific fact related events like so specific it's about the flood in Texas. Sometimes when you ask for information you want to ask just open-ended questions like just tell me general stuff happening. The like this is more like talking about the science because I know you love this. The algorithm behind these like AI tools or assistive technology or conversational agent is that it has a recommendation system behind it. It learns from your questions, it learns from these preferences and gave you recommendations. You might be interested. So because your device, your Alexa knows you very well, I'm curious to learn how is it going to recommend you stuff locally versus Gemini, which you're probably not super familiar with. And it also is not very. Knowledgeable about your preferences. So we're going to try this out and then we'll wrap up and conclude. Can you potentially maybe hold Alexa or make it more visible and ask this voice command on the right side so we can see what Alexa is telling us about your local news or events? So you just read this off from the screen, OK.  00:26:53 Speaker 1  Ok. Can you provide me with the latest local news?  00:27:02 Speaker 3  Did you say Alexa?   00:27:07 Speaker 1  Alexa, can you provide me with the low, low, latest local and international news?  00:27:27 Speaker 3  Did they recognize you? Let me see if I can paint your screen.  00:27:36 Alexa  Racing District telling us that that tunnel has one way in and one way out. So Lindsey had those workers not been able to scramble over that degree field. This could have been an entirely different scenario. Imagine so. Alright, Kane Whitworth, Phil. Thanks to. You as always. It's been nearly one week since that tragic flooding cave in Texas, and tonight the exhausting search for the missing continues. Now President Trump is set to visit Texas Hill Country, and the growing questions about plans to cut FEMA and leader concerns about just how long it took for officials to issue their warnings. Several has the concerning timeline and the latest from Hill. I'm sorry. Hey, Trevor. Well, Lindsey, we just got an update from officials moments ago that the number of people missing here in Hill Country in Texas has dropped from 172 down to 166. It's not much of movement, but it is the first real movement that we have seen in about 48 hours. It is a massive search effort that's required with thousands of people here on the ground and combing through. The ravaged river banks of the Guadalupe River, and we are a long way from the end of the. Tonight the agonizing search efforts in the Texas Hill Country officials say there's 166 people still missing, the number barely budging in 48 hours. This is the kind of terrain that the search crews are dealing with and flipped over vehicle. All this debris that's piled up high. We have a rescue crew right here. They've got a dog with them.  00:29:01 Speaker 3  I'm going to ask you to tell Alexa to stop.  00:29:05 Speaker 1  Stop. Alexa, stop.  00:29:07 Speaker 3  That's correct. There we go. Good job. So here's my question. Do you feel Alexa registered or heard? What's your command earlier or it was just playing the video that you had it on? Alexa.  00:29:24 Speaker 1  I think when I when I said I. International events, I think you just went straight to like the national news. Yeah, no, like, maybe because I maybe originally asked about it. Maybe it just kind of cued off that.  00:29:42 Speaker 3  Yeah, you also stumbled upon the actual command. As you were saying it. I did notice it had a few words that a little bit hurt, like latest local or international news.  00:29:55 Speaker 1  Yeah, that was a stumble.  00:29:57 Speaker 3  Yeah, let's try that one more time and ask Alexa, OK, you may want to pick one because it's hard to get both local and international news and think about how you want to say this. So Alexa can truly get the specific information you need it. And don't forget to add your keyword like Alexa. OK.  00:30:15 Speaker 1  Yeah, her.  00:30:17 Speaker 3  There was a lot of learning. Remember this summer is training Level 2, so we're like expecting you to do a lot more at the same time and you're doing OK, you're holding up and you're keeping, you're keeping up with your good work. Yeah, let's try that one more time.  00:30:36 Speaker 1  Alexa. Can you provide me with the local? Alexa, can you provide me with the latest local news?  00:30:54 Alexa  Available on Apple TV, Android TV, Android, Smart TV, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire tablet, Roku TV, Samsung Smart TV.  00:31:08 Speaker 1  Stop. Alexa, stop.  00:31:12 Speaker 3  OK.  00:31:13 Speaker 1  Just gave me like all these things you can stream it on this you can get it on that new source.  00:31:19 Speaker 3  So that means this doesn't work. How can we modify this if we're not here training you? You're like asking for local news on your own at home. How would you modify this voice command to be something more specific?  00:31:36 Speaker 1  I'll say her name. Can you provide me with the latest Orange County News or something like or or to where I am? Yeah.  00:31:47 Speaker 3  That's very good. You had you had a very specific location, even though, like, I'm giving you ideas. This is general local, but the Alexa needs to actually know what is local referring to, right. Yeah, that was a good catch. Anything else you think you can help add to this command to make it more specific?  00:32:13 Speaker 1  I may need to give a topic to that news like. You can ask can you provide me the latest? Local biotechnology news or. Local local weather or like, are you going to ask her a date like you know? And I'll come into that like, you know, I asked her what the date that the US open of surfing or something like that, just that would be a specific question. Types when a broad term like, what are some? Like free events this summer at the beach or something like.  00:32:55 Speaker 3  Yeah.  That's a lot of good ideas, R. I think you can probably save them for homework and work on those between. I love the idea about local news related to like biomedical. I think such a great topic that's specific related to news. I know there are some good companies in Orange County and stuff you're interested with that.  00:33:16 Speaker 1  Yeah. And like Irvine, like, you know, this big, big name and it's like Edwards life Sciences, they got a new location here in Irvine testing area. It's like big deal for me.  00:33:33 Speaker 3  That's me. So why don't you take a few minutes to come up with a command you can probably type it. I'm happy to swap it and update the slide real quick so you can read it in visually easy way for you, but let's update the command so you can get new. Information and whatever you put in the chat, I'm going to ask Lori to help us. She's going to put in Gemini and then get a a generated commands and response and we can see what happens, OK. So tell me how you want to change or adapt this Alexa command. We just. Sorry still go to the screen share. But allow me to type on it. In a few minutes, so swap my screen. OK, there we go. OK, so we have this. What would you like me to actually? Say or use for this particular command. Or update on this command.  00:34:40 Speaker 1  Her name? Can you provide me with? Local. Biotechnology news in Orange County.  00:34:55 Speaker 3  Great.  00:34:56 Speaker 1  See what happens.  00:34:58 Speaker 3  Let's reshare this. OK. Can you see the screen OK.  00:35:07 Speaker 1  Yes.  00:35:08 Speaker 3  Wait, OK, let's try. Remember, you got to wake her up, and then we're going to ask this specific question to Alexa. And then once you have it, just do the same, hold it up, and then we. Can see what's on. The screen something well, like nice and good, but we'll give it a. try  00:35:19 Speaker 1  Alright. OK. Alexa. Can you provide me with the with local biotechnology news in Orange County?  00:35:36 Alexa  Here's your name. In northern ducks. After days of promising a home run, it seems the Ducks have barely pulled off an RBI single.  00:35:59 Speaker 1  I might switch right over to like Sports News, so I don't think it moved down. Understand me.  00:36:05 Speaker 3  Oh. I didn't give you what you wanted. Ohh, I'm sorry.  00:36:10 Speaker 1  Went to Anaheim Ducks of all things.  00:36:14 Speaker 3  OK.So it caught the Orange County keywords, but not the bio.  00:36:21 Speaker 1  Bio-technology About analogy could just be like. That's not a term that most like let's say users say like that. So but. Cool. Like I don't know.  00:36:32 Speaker 3  I did notice you also this is the second time you ended up like stumbling upon that word again. So we'll probably do a few like just over articulation practices. So you were comfortable. Word.  00:36:46 Speaker 1  Coming out. Yeah. It's one of my goals in speech therapy, just, like, make it more. Understandable for other people, it's not my most.  00:36:56 Speaker 3  I'm glad I caught a very difficult long word with like multi syllables. So what I'm going to do is let Lori try to show something from Geminiand see if we can have something good.  00:37:09 Speaker 1  OK.  00:37:10 Speaker 3  Satisfactory. That's why we're using multiple AI's, right?  00:37:13 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:37:14 Speaker 3  Lori. And feel free to screen share.  00:38:05 Speaker 2  Give me a second, OK?  00:38:07 Speaker 3  Take your time.  00:38:07 Speaker 2  Here there we go.  00:38:10 Speaker 3  I think I saw your tab. It's like right next to your soap notes tab.  00:38:18 Speaker 2  Here we go. All right. I just typed in the prompt. Can you provide me with local biotechnology news in Orange County? Did I get it right, R?  00:38:30 Speaker 1  She did all right. You can't.  00:38:31 Speaker 2  Here we go. Let's see what we got. Right. We got a lot of very detailed information. Let's see, let me scroll for you. Key developments you see, Irvine? Industry growth check. So in a way, we've got a little too much information, don't.  00:39:04 Speaker 1  Yeah, it's a lot, but like basically bullet points is like I like.  00:39:06 Speaker 2  Is there any? You want bullet points, or do you want to constrain the content at all?  00:39:14 Speaker 1  Both contain the content first.  00:39:16 Speaker 2  OK. OK, So what content do you want? Would you be more interested in like industry content?  00:39:26 Speaker 1  UM. Industry, yeah.  00:39:31 Speaker 2  OK, please. So now we're going to modify that prompt. Please give me industry. Content. On this topic, right. We don't have to say please by the way, but it's kind of nice. OK. All right. OK, now we're getting a little bit more specific. But what's interesting is that now we've got more content.  00:40:12 Speaker 1  Yeah, I just looked down like the paragraph. I heard that I looked at Terminal Edwards, life Sciences. That's a big name in biotech.   00:40:22 Speaker 2  That. An interesting topic too. Should we, should we ask for information about Edwards?  00:40:27 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:40:33 Speaker 2  About Edwards biotech, right.  00:40:36 Speaker 1  Average life Sciences is a.  00:40:37 Speaker 2  Oh, sorry. Life sciences, OK? Why am I not spelling sciences? OK, here we go. All right, so now it almost it lost. It seemed to lose the information about the idea of latest news, and now it's kind of giving us like a core dump. How would we, how would we get back to the latest information, do you think? So we have this was the original prompt. What could we do? How could we modify original prompt?  00:41:32 Speaker 1  Current information about you to like maybe early in this year would be all right, but like 2025?  00:41:34 Speaker 2  There you go. I I like that idea. 02020 Oh, it's even more constrained. OK, let's give 2025 news. How about that? Or should we say news information?  00:41:52 Speaker 1  Some news because like. But but just happened to Edwards.  00:41:58 Speaker 2  OK. I'm just going to copy paste here. And now I'm interested to see what we get. OK. Well, it's giving U.S. financial information, which you probably don't need, right?  00:42:26 Speaker 1  Like you know, I just want, like, actual news that the companies doing current inventions or processes say something if they make the new procedure, that other I was going to pick up like that, they have their name on it, it's gonna be patent. Patent. So if they do that, it's going to be.  00:42:45 Speaker 2  So can you revise that prompt with me? Let's say only. Give me what?  00:43:02 Speaker 1  New Edwards sciences. Procedures. Procedures see what happened.  00:43:10 Speaker 2  Procedures. OK, only give me information. On new. 20 on new procedures.  00:43:23 Speaker 1  Yeah. Do it there.  00:43:37 Speaker 2  OK, so that helped a little bit, huh? Transcatheter aortic valve replacement?  00:43:40 Speaker 1  Yeah. Yeah, they're like, you know, in your heart, you got these valves and they're making new ones.  00:43:48 Speaker 2  Cool. OK. What I like here or what's interesting is. They give us what's new and then significance, right?  00:43:58 Speaker 1  Yeah, it was. They they got this new thing, but it was going to do this. That's right. It's important. Yeah. Like learning about stuff like that.  00:44:08 Speaker 2  So is there anything that you want to do to make this even more condensed? Here's the prompt. We have only give me information on your procedures, so we did get. We did get the information we wanted, but do you want to ask for bullet points this time? Like one sentence bullet points.  00:44:34 Speaker 1  Yeah, one cents bullet points it condense it more because straight to the fact points.  00:44:41 Speaker 2  OK, so why don't you give me the prompt? This is what we had before.  00:44:53 Speaker 1  Yeah. Uhm. And then remember, Genesis or whatever her name.  00:45:07 Speaker 2  When you said you said condense.  00:45:10 Speaker 1  I like condensed information about the. Is. 2025 new procedures.  00:45:19 Speaker 2  OK, I think you I think I could just say condense to one bullet .1 sentence. Bullet points, OK.  00:45:27 Speaker 1  3/20.  00:45:27 Speaker 2  See what we get. I don't think we need to do. This. But I'm just going to put this in. For. For learning. Condense this information. To one sentence, bullet points, let's see what we get. Well. What do you think? Do we lose? Do we lose anything valuable or are you happy with what we've got here?  00:46:09 Speaker 1  I can. I'm happy with it, but like most like I know this area like these terms you're using, but if someone has more of a. Like a lay person's perspective about like what Edwards is doing, we kind of. A lot of detail, so you can go right over the head, but maybe if I'm asking about. I'm really directed into this field, but I wanted to have a casual. Background into I want to learn about it, but it kind of be a lot, so I'll be like too much.  00:46:48 Speaker 2  So do you think that if you wanted to get that more scientific detail that you could or?  00:46:59 Speaker 2  Do you think you could figure out how to? Do that.  00:47:03 Speaker 1  Yeah, I could. Just ask for that. Make make my command specific about. The topic I would like to learn more about, yeah.  00:47:24 Speaker 2  So Doctor do do we have more time or? Should we wrap? That.  00:47:29 Speaker 3  I'm looking at the slides. I don't think we have time for another one, but R, are you to maybe share one or two pieces of news or information? You looked up this session to the rest of the team and as well as M.  00:47:47 Speaker 1  Uhm, I just uhm. Looked at some. New updates and like this company, Edwards, Life Science doing some. New procedures for like. Monitoring the heart valve transplants and like that's, I feel that I like to look into because. My. Background is in life sciences, so you know they're in the area. So where I live, it's like it's good for me to be up to date on my field. Yeah.  00:48:25 Speaker 3  That's great. So between now and next time, which is a new topic that we're going to to introduce to you, you can use these AI tools to get this up to date information. You get it in a very easy to read and process format rather than links and pages, which may seem very overwhelming. For you.  00:48:46 Speaker 1  Yeah. It's like too much.  00:48:49 Speaker 3  And then the Alexa sometimes won't give you the proper information. So this is just another tool to help you, kind of like supplement. There's that gap in whatever you are doing and you can use this either on the phone as a mobile app or on the web page. So a quick homework for you. Set up your Gemini account, explore some of the things related to like news and facts like. Since you love this company, use the AI to do some to do some research and how they are hyperlinks, because sometimes a makes up stuff. So maybe like look up their website to see if these key informations are accurate. OK, so next week, before we start our session, we're going to ask you, hey, tell us about this Edwards Biotech company because none of us know anything about it. You're going. To be the expert.  00:49:38 Speaker 1  Right.  00:49:39 Speaker 3  Great. I'm going to ask everyone to get ready to be back to the main room. R, you want to practice? Just like your little blurb about the flood event, the flooding event, the disaster in Texas. You got my little notes. OK, I will get ready to have. People come back OK.        , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  In this response, I will summarize and format the provided content on SOAP notes following the structure and style described in the rubric:\n\nTitle: SOAP Notes: An Essential Tool for Healthcare Documentation and Communication\n\nIntroduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note is a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers.

Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  In response to your request for a SOAP note on the topic \"Ensuring the structure and style of the provided text follows the rubric for a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note\", I have provided an example SOAP note below:\n\nTitle: Ensuring the Structure and Style of Text Follows the Rubric for a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) Note\n\nSubjective\nChief Complaint (CC): Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI): The text does not follow the required structure and style of a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nHistory: No pertinent past medical history is mentioned.\nReview of Systems (ROS): Not applicable as no symptoms or conditions have been reported.\nCurrent Medications, Allergies: Not applicable as no medications or allergies have been documented.\n\nObjective\nVital signs: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPhysical exam findings: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nLaboratory data: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nImaging results: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nRecognition and review of documentation of other clinicians: The text does not demonstrate adherence to the SOAP note structure, indicating a lack of collaboration and shared understanding among healthcare providers.\n\nAssessment\nProblem: Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style, leading to inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nDifferential Diagnosis: It is unclear if there are other underlying issues contributing to the lack of adherence to the SOAP note structure and style.\nDiscussion: The text demonstrates a lack of understanding or adherence to the required structure and style for a SOAP note, making it difficult to quickly understand the patient's status and the assessment and plan for their care.\n\nPlan\nTesting needed: Educational interventions to teach proper documentation techniques in accordance with the SOAP note rubric.\nTherapy needed (medications): Not applicable as medications are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults: Not applicable as specialists are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPatient education, counseling: Provide educational materials on the importance and benefits of using a SOAP note structure, along with training on proper documentation techniques.\n\nThe text provided does not follow the required structure and style for a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation.

Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file  Session 4 M.A. (Self care) 7-17-2025.m4a    Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  And then. Yeah, yeah. I just start to record.  Thank you. Thank you.  All right. So all right, M, let's get started. Tell me, how was your time at the beach? What did you do?  00:00:15 Speaker 2  That's fun.  00:00:17 Speaker 3  What did you? Just.  00:00:19 Speaker 2  No, me and my. Mom just went for a little while.  00:00:22 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:00:23 Speaker 2  We took our dog Roxy.  00:00:25 Speaker 4  OK.  00:00:27 Speaker 2  We didn't take her dog off, she but.  We should have.  00:00:32 Speaker 1  Yeah. Did you hear more dogs there on the beach?  00:00:36 Speaker 2  Yeah, there are a lot of dogs on the beach.  00:00:39 Speaker 1  OK. M, do you hope your parents take? Care of the dog.   00:00:47 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:00:47 Speaker 1  Do you do anything for him or her?  00:00:50 Speaker 2  For her.  00:00:52 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:00:53 Speaker 2  I do.  00:00:54 Speaker 1  Oh, OK. And what kind of things? Do you do?  00:00:58 Speaker 2  Nothing much.  00:01:00  All right.  00:01:00 Speaker 3  What do you do for Roxy when she growls at the door? Do you do anything? No. Do you ignore? Her. Or do you?  00:01:08 Speaker 2  Yeah, just in there.  00:01:09 Speaker 3  Let her outside. M, do you let her? Outside.  00:01:14 Speaker 2  Outside.  00:01:16 Speaker 3  OK. Is she? And when do you?  Let her in. Yep.  00:01:20 Speaker 1  OK. OK, that's good. Is there anything else that you that that you like to do like some kind of care that you like to provide for your dog and help help Mom and Dad with it?  00:01:34 Speaker 2  I like to fill up a bowl of water.  00:01:37 Speaker 1  OK, alright, that's great. How often do you have to do that?  00:01:43 Speaker 2  Once a day.  00:01:45 Speaker 3  OK.  00:01:49 Speaker 1  All right, I'm going to share my screen and today we are going to talk about self-care and medical needs. The the reason I was asking questions about Roxy, I did not know you had a dog. And then also if there are things that. That would help you ask. I mean, if you wanted to ask Gemini about caring for your dog, you know and and helping helping Mom and Dad with it or something that you could do that would be very nice. What do you think?  00:02:18 Speaker 2  Would be.  00:02:20 Speaker 1  Yeah. Would that be useful to you?  OK, alright, let's get started and see. What we can, what kind of? Questions we can ask and what kind of commands we can. Share. Right.  OK. Can you see my?  00:02:36 Speaker 3  Screen. Yes, we can. OK.  00:02:39 Speaker 1  All right, so. Self-care and M needs. I think you're pretty familiar with that from last year and we talked about medication management, searching for laundry and self-care, tips, tips to improve physical and mental health. And searching for some home remedies, if you if you had some health. Problems and searching for a nearby doctor. So with Alexa we were able to do many of these, but we're going to see how different those two are going to be like if you were to ask Alexa and if you were to ask Gemini. So what we could do, do you have your? Alexa anywhere.  00:03:25 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's behind.  00:03:26 Speaker 1  Yeah. Ohh OK. So it's still it's on, right?  00:03:26 Speaker 2  Us.  00:03:29 Speaker 1  It will still give. You information if you had, if you had to use. What?  00:03:33 Speaker 3  Yes it is.  00:03:35 Speaker 1  All right. And do do you happen to have it on your phone at all? I mean, you can use that too. If you wanted to practice, actually it's.  00:03:43 Speaker 3  It is on M's phone, but his phone is having an issue, but it's on the iPad and I.  00:03:47 Speaker 1  Have the iPad right. OK. Yeah, that's good, too. So I I wanted to for some of those commands. Where?  We're looking for location specific details or a time specific details where you are you know. I think you know setting up a reminder or like an event, then we want to see and use Alexa as well like to see what the difference is, we're going to see if that makes any difference and which one is better, OK. Alright, OK, let's see. Right. Uh, let's see. So some help managing medications.  We did this with Alexa last year, M. It's about creating a medication list and then showing your medication list. So let's see if it will let you create a medication list on your on Gemini first. We know that Alexa does it pretty well, but let's start with Gemini and this one.  And and see how how that goes.  00:04:53  Thanks.  00:04:53 Speaker 1  So.  00:04:54 Speaker 3  Is the Gemini live or just Gemini?  00:04:59 Speaker 1  It's up to you. I I think you said in the e-mail that the live worked when and then he could use it with his voice, right? Yeah.  00:05:08 Speaker 3  Yes. Where when you use the regular Gemini, you have to touch your microphone and then you have to find the spot to turn it off the stop.  00:05:17 Speaker 1  Turn it off where is.  00:05:19 Speaker 3  His life. Right. You don't have to do that. It's your voice. And then you just touch the screen.  00:05:24 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK. Yeah, sure. So for sure. Yeah, let's do it live. If it because that that way he can be more independent with, you know, working on those commands.  00:05:35 Speaker 3  You're just gonna use my phone, M to experiment.  00:05:36 Speaker 2  OK.  00:05:41 Speaker 5  OK, I'm ready when you are. What would you like me to do?  00:05:44 Speaker 2  Making medications for me.  00:05:48 Speaker 5  So I can't use reminders yet when we.  Are live for. Now going live is great for things like chatting, finding answers, or brainstorming new ideas.  00:05:57 Speaker 3  Did you hear? That.  00:05:58 Speaker 1  So what did it say? Uh, it cannot use it. It cannot.  00:06:01 Speaker 3  It cannot make a medication list going live yet it's great for getting what was the other thing it said notification and.  00:06:09 Speaker 2  Notification.  00:06:13 Speaker 3  Reminder and remind no, it wasn't reminders. I should have had.  00:06:18 Speaker 1  It OK, I have it in the chat in. Case do you do you want to just?  Try it on Alexa maybe.  00:06:27 Speaker 3  OK. Or I can go to the. Other one and also.  00:06:30 Speaker 5  Control other apps yet when?  00:06:31 Speaker 1  We are live. Let's let's try. Let's try Alexa, because I think that's as effective when it comes to making lists. And you know, creating lists and showing those or reading those lists stuff. So. So let's just practice that those kind of. You know, commands on on there, whichever, because I feel like whichever he can do on his own independently, those we can, you know, test on Gemini. But others like I think maybe we can we can try Alexa.  00:07:03 Speaker 3  OK. Yeah. To talk to. You're going to use A to make a list medication.  00:07:11 Speaker 4  List no, no.  00:07:13 Speaker 2  Open the Alexa app.  00:07:16 Speaker 3  Huh.  00:07:17 Speaker 4  OK, go ahead.  00:07:21 Speaker 3  It's open. Just make your list M.  It's open.  00:07:31 Speaker 2  Hey, Alexa.  00:07:37 Speaker 4  Go ahead.  00:07:41 Speaker 3  Make a medication.  00:07:42 Speaker 2  Make a medication list.  00:07:50 Speaker 3  No. Try again, M.  00:07:52 Speaker 2  Yeah, let's make a medication list.  00:07:59 Speaker 3  It could be using your device.  00:08:04 Speaker 2  Yeah, let's make a medication list. Sermon.  00:08:13 Speaker 3  Let me just put it over here.  00:08:18 Speaker 1  OK. M, have you tried making medication lists on with your with your glasses at all?  00:08:26 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:08:28 Speaker 1  OK. And does how how is? That and does that help you more? Yeah. OK. You can try that too, either 1 whichever 1 you prefer. If you prefer Alexa, we can try on that. Or we can try it on on your on your glasses.  00:08:46 Speaker 2  OK.  00:08:47 Speaker 3  Try.  00:08:48 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, make a medication this.  00:08:55 Speaker 3  You know what, M? You'll have to.  00:08:58 Speaker 4  Could I ask you?  00:09:02 Speaker 2  A medication called Trazodone.  00:09:07 Speaker 4  I've added medication called.  00:09:12 Speaker 2  Mark 2. As the Mac tool.  00:09:25 Speaker 4  What other items you want?  00:09:27 Speaker 2  The Mac too.  00:09:34 Speaker 1  No.  00:09:34 Speaker 4  You have.  00:09:37  It's.  00:09:37 Speaker 4  What?  00:09:38 Speaker 3  What's happening is with the glasses when he talks, you guys can't hear because it's going through his glasses and the one that's talking is the actual device that's behind him. So.  00:09:52  Garment.  00:09:52 Speaker 3  Take it off.  00:09:55 Speaker 1  Ohh, I'm so sorry.  00:09:57 Speaker 3  But you're you're worthless. It made the. So on the main device.  00:10:01 Speaker 1  OK, perfect. It did make the list OK. Alright, that's good. But I mean we can also, you know use whichever 1 is more convenient because you M, you wear your glasses almost all all the time. Now I think you're so much more used to it. So we can, you know, do these commands using your glasses. Because I I think the two things together, it's it's becoming very difficult and challenging. So that's fine, you know, but for this next one, since it made the medication list already on Alexa, let's just try this next one on Alexa. But the next few ones, whichever Gemini live cannot be used for, we can try his glasses. Let's try. It OK? Yeah, that would be good. OK.  So M, the next command we have here is show your medication. Show me my medication list.  00:10:58 Speaker 2  Yeah, Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:08 Speaker 3  So.  00:11:09 Speaker 2  Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:17 Speaker 3  No, I think you have.  00:11:18 Speaker 2  To say Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:25 Speaker 3  She was the lines moving, but I think he's just a touched ohh. She did. She did.  00:11:31 Speaker 1  She did get it. OK. All right. On the on the iPad. OK.  00:11:35 Speaker 3  Medication called Trazodone. You've got Robitussin Tylenol cough drops and neosporin. No.  00:11:42 Speaker 2  OK. You're welcome.  00:11:44 Speaker 1  Did you did you Add all of them right now or was it only the Trazodone that he was trying to add?  00:11:53 Speaker 3  Right. The Trazodone tonight and the other ones were there from before.  00:11:58 Speaker 1  From before. OK, OK. Alright, M. When when you've used to manage medications, if you've used your glasses, do you check those medications off once you have received those medications? Or just leave them on the on the. List what do you do?  00:12:23 Speaker 2  I try to check them off, but if if I if I don't remember then they stay on.  00:12:27 Speaker 1  Then it stays on. OK got it. Right, that's that's why maybe from that that was the list from the previous times. Got it. OK. All right, so the next.  00:12:41 Speaker 3  Remember when we say show me, it shows it, it doesn't read.  00:12:46 Speaker 1  Right, it does not read it, yeah. That is, that is a that is. A drawback from Alexa I remember I I think from last time. So I think show and read me my medication list might be a better command for you M. So that yeah, it makes. OK. All right, let's try to find some over the counter medications, OK. Let's see. Alright, so the next command. Can you put your glasses back on and let's let's try it with the glasses because I think.  You use those more than. Your Alexa app.  00:13:31 Speaker 2  OK.  00:13:32 Speaker 1  OK, So what medication would you like to find if if you, if you wanted to know something or if you're curious about finding a medication?  00:13:42 Speaker 2  M.  00:13:45 Speaker 3  An over the counter, one not a prescription.  00:13:48 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:13:50 Speaker 3  Something over the counter. OK.  00:13:55 Speaker 2  Ibuprofen.  00:13:56 Speaker 1  OK, ibuprofen. So let's ask the command, let's do this command. Where do I find ibuprofen?  00:14:04 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, where do I find ibuprofen?  00:14:08 Speaker 1  OK.  00:14:12 Speaker 4  CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away.  00:14:17 Speaker 1  It's the device at the back that's talking correct. OK, that worked OK.  00:14:20  Yeah.  00:14:23 Speaker 1  How about let's compare the responses now, so that gave you some information. I couldn't hear that, but was that accurate like? So was it closed like the pharmacies or something?  00:14:35 Speaker 3  And. It listed pharmacies that are very close to our homes and the address.  00:14:36 Speaker 1  OK. Got it.  Which we're the address. OK, M, let's try that same command on with your glasses. So with meta.  00:14:52 Speaker 2  The matter?  In Maida. Where can I find ibuprofen?  00:15:10 Speaker 3  What did he say?  00:15:11 Speaker 2  Targets CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.  00:15:13 Speaker 1  OK. Was it listing the addresses as? Well.  00:15:17 Speaker 2  No.  00:15:18 Speaker 1  No. OK. So that's the difference. It's not giving a location for those pharmacies, it's it's just listing like regular pharmacies where you could find like or regular stores where you could find them.  00:15:32 Speaker 4  Yep.  00:15:33 Speaker 1  OK, alright.  00:15:34 Speaker 3  Should he try Gemini?  00:15:38 Speaker 1  We can try. Yeah, for sure. Let's let's give it a go.  00:15:42 Speaker 3  House.  00:15:44 Speaker 2  Hey, Jim and I are working to find ibuprofen.  00:15:50 Speaker 5  I couldn't find any stores that sell ibuprofen nearby. You could try searching online to see what's available.  00:15:56 Speaker 1  Hmm. OK, so location specific details are are the best like using Alexa I guess.  00:16:05 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:16:06 Speaker 1  Yeah, or maybe Siri. That would be similar, I guess, but uh, more or less. One of those tools rather than anything. Which is run within all the large language model I guess or an AI.  00:16:21 Speaker 3  What do you wanna know what Siri says?  00:16:25 Speaker 1  Sure.  00:16:26 Speaker 3  Oh yes.  00:16:27 Speaker 2  Hey Siri, where can I find ibuprofen?  00:16:33  I don't know where you are.  00:16:36 Speaker 2  Said I don't know where you are. XXXX(Address).  00:16:37 Speaker 3  Tell her where you are.  Oh, she didn't care.  00:16:46 Speaker 2  XXXX(Address)  00:16:48 Speaker 3  Have to wake her up.  00:16:50 Speaker 2  He's stirring. Hey Siri. XXXX(Address). Where do I find ibuprofen?  00:17:03 Speaker 4  You're welcome.  00:17:08 Speaker 3  Should we lost her? So. Try again to saying where do I find ibuprofen?  00:17:16 Speaker 2  Siri, where do I find you, Siri? Where do I find ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga?  00:17:23 Speaker 5  They don't seem to be able to get your current location.  00:17:27 Speaker 1  Is is the location on on this phone.  00:17:31 Speaker 3  It's. For sharing.  It should be, you know.  00:17:34 Speaker 1  That's so odd. Usually it's it's so good at picking up location if it's a phone, but.  00:17:40 Speaker 3  So.  00:17:41 Speaker 2  Siri, where do I find ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga?  00:17:47  I don't know where you are.  00:17:49 Speaker 5  OK, I found this on the web for ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga.  00:17:53  Check it out.  00:17:56 Speaker 3  And that's where Siri is the downfall. It she'll tell you where she found it, but you have to be able to see what she all.  00:17:56  1st.  00:18:05 Speaker 3  Oh, not read it aloud to you.  00:18:08 Speaker 1  Ohh got it. So I wonder if maybe we might have to add.  Like list those.  00:18:18 Speaker 3  Or.  00:18:21 Speaker 1  Yeah, that's that's tough, I know.  00:18:23 Speaker 3  That's the serious issue, but.  The Alexa. Tells you the name of the place and an address, yeah. And Gemini and Maida just tells you the name of the stores.  00:18:39 Speaker 1  Right.  00:18:40 Speaker 3  And.  00:18:40 Speaker 1  I think.  00:18:42 Speaker 3  Gemini is very limited.  00:18:44 Speaker 1  Yeah, I think if we, if we probably gave Gemini like in advance we said that this is my address and then ask.  Where can I find ibuprofen? It probably might work, but again, I'm not sure.  00:19:02 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:19:03 Speaker 1  Yeah, yeah, but that's again a lot of commands. I feel like it it has to be simple enough. And the best part about Alexa is that he can use his glasses to turn like, you know, turn on Alexa on his, like, the app on his phone or the iPad. And then he can say the command. So that makes it much easier to navigate. And seeing less number of words and comments.  00:19:30 Speaker 3  Very much.  It's the same as when you're in the actual store. He's wearing the glasses and he's asking.  A what's on my list grocery list. And she will tell him and he'll say check off tomatoes, whatever it is. And when you're in a store, it's coming. It's very indiscreet because it's coming. He only he really hears the voice. And so it's very discreet.  00:19:44 Speaker 1  MHM.  00:20:03 Speaker 3  Correct.  00:20:05 Speaker 1  Though that he has those now, I I think I think that's making it so much easier for him to navigate. M, are you enjoying those? Because it makes you. How does that make you feel?  00:20:06  Yeah.  00:20:18 Speaker 2  They make me feel good, they play music and they make me feel.  Secure.  00:20:26 Speaker 1  That's good. OK.  That's amazing. All right, let's move on. Alright so.  Here we have. Learning to do laundry, but we can do something else. Is there something else related to self-care or caring for your dog?  That.  A kind of question you might want to ask which could be, yeah, anything related to your care, your family's care, self-care, or your dogs, you know well-being.  Anything, anything of that sort that you would like to ask?  00:21:08 Speaker 2  And.  00:21:10 Speaker 1  OK, what can you think of?  00:21:15 Speaker 2  And said to a.  00:21:19 Speaker 3  Well, don't tell Priel first.  00:21:22 Speaker 2  Trial. Alright. Hey, Creole, can I say to Alex?  00:21:28 Speaker 1  OK, uh, what? What would you like to ask though?  00:21:34 Speaker 2  When can I feed my dog or no? My dog drink water?  00:21:40 Speaker 1  When can my dog dog drink?  Water. Is that what you said?  00:21:43 Speaker 2  Yeah, one kind of allow my dog to drink.  Water. OK. Yeah, sure. Hey, Alex.  I'm trying to allow my dog to drink water.  00:21:53 Speaker 4  Something.  00:22:02 Speaker 2  It's in the com reference.com puppies could start drinking water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:09 Speaker 1  Sorry, I can't hear you. What? What did. What did you say?  00:22:12 Speaker 3  Say it louder, M.  00:22:14 Speaker 2  She said here's something from here's something I found on reference.com. It's.  Puppies are allowed to drink water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:26 Speaker 1  OK.  00:22:26 Speaker 3  They can drink water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:28 Speaker 1  When they're three weeks old, OK, was.  Does that answer your question?  Or do we need to? Did you mean that how many times a day or?  00:22:38 Speaker 2  How many times a day?  00:22:39 Speaker 3  What are?  00:22:40 Speaker 1  The indications for me to give my dog water or something like that.  00:22:46 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, what are the indications for me to get my dog water?  I think she heard me, but she shut off.  00:23:00 Speaker 3  Say it louder, my.  00:23:01 Speaker 2  Hey, Alexa, what are the indications to get my dog drink water?  00:23:08 Speaker 4  There's something I found on you get your dog to make sure there's constant access. And. Chicken broth.  00:23:35 Speaker 3  Lot of information, lot of information.  00:23:36 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:23:40 Speaker 1  Could you process and like? Could? Could you remember any of the details that it just said? No, it was a lot.  00:23:48 Speaker 3  What were some of the details, M?  00:23:49 Speaker 2  The dog.  Small amounts of urine.  Take her to the hospital or the vet.  00:23:56 Speaker 1  OK.  00:23:57 Speaker 2  But the. Excuse me.  00:24:05 Speaker 1  You're OK? No worries.  00:24:08 Speaker 3  What else did she say?  00:24:10 Speaker 2  He said. I don't know. I can't remember.  00:24:17 Speaker 3  Did she say to put one bowl of water out or lots of multiple bowls of water?  00:24:22 Speaker 1  Multiple bowls of water.  Do you do that for Roxy? No. Maybe she does she.  Know, though, that that's where she drinks water.  Probably does. Yeah. All right. Do you want to try that same command for Gemini? Maybe because that would, I think that kind of question we could try live with with Gemini and see if that would give some similar or different information. Let's try.  00:24:54 Speaker 2  Hey, Jim and I, where can I? When can I allow my dog to drink water?  00:25:00 Speaker 5  If your dog just had surgery, it's best to check with your vet about when they can have water. Usually they'll say to wait a couple of hours and give them just a little at first. If your dog hasn't had surgery, then they can have water whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:13 Speaker 1  OK, that was pretty good.  00:25:17 Speaker 2  And then when whenever when is whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:18 Speaker 1  I've got.  00:25:25 Speaker 5  That's right. Dogs can drink water whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:31 Speaker 1  OK.  00:25:31 Speaker 2  Probably seem thirsty, Gemini.  00:25:35 Speaker 5  If your dog is panting a lot, drooling, or has dry looking gums, they might be thirsty. Sometimes they'll also lick their lips or look for their water bowl.  00:25:45 Speaker 1  That's amazing, M. I loved that you could ask a follow up question like that. That's amazing.  00:25:52 Speaker 2  Thank you.  00:25:53 Speaker 1  Yeah, but, and that was really good information according to me. What did. What did you think, M?  00:26:00 Speaker 2  I thought so too.  00:26:01 Speaker 1  Yeah, that was short and to the point and it gave you whatever you needed, I guess.  Did that answer your question?  00:26:09 Speaker 2  Yeah, it did.  00:26:10 Speaker 1  OK, alright, that's great. Now let's go. Let's move on.  Alright, so there are more questions about how to OK, this was all about the laundry that we talked last time. Let's try one of these. So getting so this is about getting stains out of clothes. So do you want to ask Gemini?  What do I use to get get stains out of my clothes?  00:26:40 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini.  When can I get? Where do I get or what do I use to get stains out of my clothes?  00:26:49 Speaker 5  There are lots of things you can use to get stains out of clothes. It kind of depends on what kind of stain it is. Do you know what stains your clothes?  00:26:56 Speaker 2  Bleach.  00:27:00  Did you say bleep?  00:27:01 Speaker 5  OK, for bleach stains, you'll want to use something.  00:27:05  Sorry.  00:27:06 Speaker 5  Yes, I can still hear you.  No worries. Take your time.  00:27:12 Speaker 2  Tomatoes.  Tomato juice.  00:27:20 Speaker 5  Tomato juice stains can be a bit tricky. First, try blotting up as much of the juice as you can, then rinse the stain in cold water. If it's still there, try rubbing some dish soap into the stain and washing.  It again OK.  00:27:33 Speaker 3  OK, what I what I noticed is M's.  00:27:35 Speaker 5  OK, got it.  00:27:40 Speaker 3  Didn't have a concise question to begin with.  He said what I mean where I mean and she still answered the question. Yes, that is the difference between, I guess the two systems, right? Absolutely.  It's.  00:27:58 Speaker 1  Even if there is some hesitation to begin with or during the question or the command, it will still. So take the.  Question in a context. So it kind of.  Understands the OR like you know, understands the context I could.  Say.  And then answers that question. So that is that is a good thing about using these AI tools, I guess.  00:28:25 Speaker 3  And that's a little bit more superior to Siri.  Because she's more literal.  And Alexa is kind of not as literal as Siri, but a little bit. Gemini is more forgiving.  00:28:33 Speaker 4  Mm-hmm.  00:28:45 Speaker 3  Of the three.  00:28:46 Speaker 1  I think. Ohh yeah, yeah.  When you ask if you do, you have you had any?  Success with using the glasses to ask questions like this, like for information related to self-care.  00:29:05 Speaker 2  And for the most part.  00:29:06 Speaker 3  Do you want to try the same question here you guys?  00:29:11 Speaker 1  So the question is, what do I use to get stains out of my clothes?  00:29:17 Speaker 2  In meta.  What do I use to get stains?  In my clothes.  What if my stainless bleeps?  Cherries and sour Oxiclean, or take it to a professional cleaner.  00:29:51 Speaker 3  OK.  00:29:51  Try.  00:29:52 Speaker 1  Take it to the professional cleaners and.  00:29:54 Speaker 3  It said try shout or Oxiclean or you could try taking it to a.  00:29:59 Speaker 1  Professional. Cleaner. OK, alright. I mean that seems like valid information to me. I'm not sure but but it does. Yeah, I mean.  That's comparable to what? Gemini offered, I guess like it was short. But and to the.  Point, but still gave all the details that you needed for.  I think.  00:30:22 Speaker 3  Yes, I think the key for both Maida and Gemini.  Your follow up question has to be relatively quick. You can't at too much time pass before asking that follow up or it's too late.  00:30:38 Speaker 1  Bing.  Yeah. Otherwise I think the system times out and then you might.  Have to start again.  00:30:45 Speaker 3  Yes. And so that's what M's been working on is follow up questions like this.  00:30:52 Speaker 1  Yeah. Yeah. But I think there I feel like there's such a change from the previous year to this year, just in conversation. I feel, M, I think you're doing really great, has been a good, good amount of progress that I can see from last summer to this summer.  Yes, when it comes to just conversational. And everything I think you know and I. Think the glasses are?  Great. I think they're helping a lot too. And of course, this year and if everything together, I think the therapies and all of that together.  00:31:25 Speaker 3  Definitely.  00:31:32 Speaker 1  OK. Let's see how many we have 5 minutes. OK. All right. M, anything related to self-care that you can think of that you would still want to ask Gemini or Alexa or your glasses? No, you can you can you practice a couple more commands.  00:31:53 Speaker 2  Yep.  00:31:55 Speaker 1  OK. All right, let's see. So I think with finding a doctor, it will again be the best. If we tried with Alexa because.  It's going to it's location specific information so.  We can try.  Let's try Alexa.  For finding a type of doctor, maybe. Let's let's see. Could do you think, uh, what kind of doctor would you like to find?  00:32:33 Speaker 2  Physical therapist.  00:32:36 Speaker 1  OK, let's try with Alexa first.  And then Gemini, let's see if that would.  00:32:44 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, find me a physical therapist.  00:32:50 Speaker 4  We found a few options for that.  Physical therapy 3.1 miles away from Rochester Ave. 3 miles away. Physical therapy 3 miles away.  00:33:08 Speaker 3  It gave three options, the title how far away it was. Yeah. Is that OK?  00:33:17 Speaker 2  Yes.  00:33:19 Speaker 1  Yeah, OK, that's great. And it it is definitely listing all of that along with showing it on the screen. If there is a screen, so.  That's a good part.  Let's try.  Let's try maybe with the glasses, M, because I know that Gemini will not allow you to go live with this because it's probably location specific again.  So let's ask. The same question to Mera find me.  A physical therapist.  00:33:52 Speaker 2  Middle. The medic.  Find me a physical therapist.  To make sure the we're setting to make sure the.  00:34:14 Speaker 3  Location.  00:34:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, location is on for meta.  00:34:17 Speaker 1  Location specific. It's. Yeah. OK, so here's a good way. I think when they're if you have your glasses on and you're trying to, you know, find information that is location specific. The best option in in any situation would be because you would have your phone or your iPad, which would have the Alexa app. So you tell your glasses to open the Alexa app and you know and and then then use the command like you know, finding a doctor or, you know creating.Medication like I think what was the other one that we had difficulty with? Uh.  Ohh yeah. Finding the over the counter medications or you know, things like that, I guess that it would it, it would help a lot. I I think to just use the glasses to.  Turn turn Alexa on on an on either of those devices, the phone or iPad, whatever he has. But I think like the information related.  Questions were pretty good on Gemini and made. Up both so.  Maybe we could try 1 of this. M, let's try this. How do I treat a migraine on your meta glasses? Let's see what it says.  00:35:44 Speaker 2  In metal. How do I treat a migraine?  00:35:59 Speaker 4  Having. It set.  00:36:00 Speaker 2  Said for ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Or consult the doctor for another advice.  00:36:08 Speaker 1  OK. All right. So that's that's good information, I think and. All right. Do you want to try the same one on Gemini and compare the answers?  00:36:25 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini. How can I treat a migraine?  00:36:33 Speaker 5  Migraines can be really tough over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help. Sometimes a cold compress on your forehead or a warm bath can ease the pain too. Just a reminder that I don't provide medical advice or diagnosis. You should always talk to a medical professional.  00:36:51 Speaker 1  OK. OK. M, can you tell me? Which one had better information according to you?  00:37:00 Speaker 2  The Gemini.  00:37:01 Speaker 1  Gemini. Why do you think?  00:37:06 Speaker 2  She said because. I can't give medical advice.  00:37:11 Speaker 5  OK, great.  00:37:14 Speaker 1  OK. Alright, so it kind of gave a disclaimer that it cannot provide like any medical advice and. Well, which is good and that's why you were you would pick Gemini or Mera in this one.  00:37:34 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:37:34 Speaker 1  Yeah.  It also gave one extra information. I don't know if Maeda gave that to you, but.  Did Meda also tell about the cold compress?  00:37:48 Speaker 2  No.  00:37:48 Speaker 3  Or just.  00:37:50 Speaker 1  Yeah, it it just I think you told me only about ibuprofen and then the OR a doctor visit the doctor. So there was one extra piece of information which can be like you know, I think some people might benefit from that.  Yeah, I I mean, I have heard some people would probably use like a cold compress. So which is a good information, good piece of information.  To have, I guess.  Yeah. OK.  Alright, I think we are good, but.  I don't know.  If if you do you have anything else, M, that you would like to try on either of the tools that we have related to?  And self-care medical needs or carrying out the dog or anything, anything at all.   00:38:43 Speaker 2  No.  00:38:44 Speaker 3  I have an idea.  00:38:46 Speaker 4  Yeah.  00:38:46 Speaker 3  You're talking about laundry and self-care on the live. When I tried the live at the beach, it just took a picture, kind of like an app called seeing AI. So if I'm going to put it on live, I'll get M to ask and I'll turn the camera on him.  00:39:06 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:39:06 Speaker 3  What am I wearing? Because as a blind person, you would like to know what you're wearing, right? It does. It. Does that sound good? Let's just try to see if it'll work because it's kind of related.  00:39:12 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:39:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  00:39:19 Speaker 3  OK.  00:39:21 Speaker 2  In Germany.  00:39:23 Speaker 4  I gotta turn the camera facing.  00:39:25 Speaker 2  Gemini.  00:39:26 Speaker 4  One minute, please.  00:39:31 Speaker 3  So.  00:39:32 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini. What am I wearing?  00:39:37 Speaker 5  I can't tell what you're wearing from here. Could you show me again?  00:39:42 Speaker 2  In Germany, what am I wearing?  00:39:52 Speaker 5  I can't see what you're wearing.  00:39:55 Speaker 3  I can't. That's what color your shirt.  00:39:58 Speaker 2  Is and Gemini? What color is my shirt?  00:40:00 Speaker 5  I can't see what you're wearing.  00:40:03  Oh.  00:40:03 Speaker 3  I and it's looking right at him. Like you can see M in the screen.  00:40:08 Speaker 1  In in the in the frame OK.  00:40:10  Yeah.  00:40:14 Speaker 5  OK, I can't tell what color your shirt.  Is.  00:40:19 Speaker 1  That's interesting.  00:40:21 Speaker 3  Ohh that is yeah, because it's not able to get the color.  00:40:26 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:40:29 Speaker 3  What color is my shirt?  00:40:29 Speaker 5  Yeah, not able to identify.  I can't tell what color your shirt is.  00:40:35 Speaker 3  I mean.  Books by Jennifer Keller.  00:40:38 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK, that's pretty interesting, I know.  00:40:45 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:40:45 Speaker 1  Because you have your front camera on and it it's it. I mean, he's in the frame, and even then it's not. Probably does it? Do you think that if you like if the front camera were to be on and you took a picture and then it would?  Be able to.  And then if you like entered it on there and then it. Would be able to talk.  00:41:13 Speaker 5  I can't use Google lens yet when we are live. For now, going live is great for things like chatting, finding answers or brainstorming new ideas.  00:41:21 Speaker 1  Got it. So.  00:41:23 Speaker 3  OK.  Are the Google ends at the top and that's what I pushed and there was nothing.  00:41:30  Nothing.  00:41:32 Speaker 3  And here. What color is my shirt?  00:41:42 Speaker 5  I'm having trouble identifying the color of your shirt. It looks like it could be pink.  00:41:46 Speaker 3  Oh, it looks like it could be pink. OK.  00:41:47 Speaker 1  Looks like OK.  00:41:50 Speaker 3  Maybe it's the lighting.  00:41:53 Speaker 1  Yeah, but you know, it should still say you know how it said for you that it could be pink.  00:42:00 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:42:00 Speaker 1  It would at least the lives 1-2 would be able to. You would think that it would be.  Able to give.  You an option at least that ohh it would. It seems like it could be this.  00:42:10 Speaker 3  Sir. Yeah, and that was using the live.  00:42:15 Speaker 1  That was using the.  00:42:16 Speaker 3  OK. And this is right this top. So maybe that's why it saw it right?  00:42:18 Speaker 1  OK.  It probably could be.  Yeah, yeah, probably this the version that you know how there's a free version of Gemini that we are using.  All of the versions are not as as advanced so.  That that could be.  It also, but yeah, I don't know.  00:42:48 Speaker 3  Yeah. Yeah. All right, that's great. Let's see.  00:42:57 Speaker 1  Right, M, I think you did a great job. Do you have anything else that you'd like to?  Share.  00:43:03 Speaker 2  No.  00:43:04 Speaker 3  No. OK, what's easier for you to use you like the Gemini?  And do you like using Alexa with your glasses?  00:43:15 Speaker 2  Yep.  00:43:16 Speaker 1  Yeah, with the glasses, I guess the I mean anything location specific or date or event specific that he has to do like calendar specific I would say I guess using the glasses to either connect it to Siri or wherever his calendar is or Alexa that would be.  That would be very good. I guess that that still works better.  00:43:40 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:43:40 Speaker 1  But I think with information Gemini.  Did a great job. I guess when it came to.  Providing short information, but still you know it's still concise, but to the point and directing it.  00:43:49 Speaker 3  Yes it will.  00:43:55 Speaker 1  Pretty well I guess.  00:43:56 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:43:58 Speaker 1  OK. I'll see you guys in the break in the main room actually, OK.  00:44:04 Speaker 3  Get ready to share something to R, M.  00:44:08 Speaker 2  Alright.     , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse:  It appears you have provided a detailed explanation of the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\nThe SOAP note is a structured method of documenting patient encounters that helps healthcare workers assess, diagnose, and treat patients effectively. It consists of four sections: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n1. **Subjective**: This section contains the patient's subjective experiences, personal views, or feelings about their condition. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI), which provides context for the assessment and plan.\n\n2. **Objective**: This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. **Assessment**: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, lists the problem, differential diagnoses, and discusses the plan for each problem.\n\n4. **Plan**: This section details the need for additional testing, specialist referrals, patient education, counseling, and any therapy needed (medications).\n\nThe SOAP note helps improve communication among healthcare professionals and ensures a comprehensive and efficient assessment and treatment plan for patients. However, it does have some limitations, such as the inability to document changes over time effectively. Extensions to the SOAP model, like SOAPE, have been proposed to address this gap.\n\nIn the provided conversation, the subjective information includes the patient's chief complaint (chest pain) and history of present illness (describing the chest pain). The objective information might include findings from a physical exam or laboratory tests. The assessment could involve considering potential causes for the chest pain based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, and the plan might involve ordering further tests or prescribing medication.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

This document will detail the components of a SOAP note and its significance in clinical practice.\n\nFunction\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThis section documents the subjective experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient. It provides context for the Assessment and Plan sections. Key components include:\n- Chief Complaint (CC): The patient's reported symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or statement describing why they are presenting.\n- History of Present Illness (HPI): A detailed account of the patient's CC, organized using the OLDCARTS acronym.\n- Medical history: Current or past medical conditions relevant to the case.\n- Surgical history: Important surgeries and their details.\n- Family history: Pertinent family medical history.\n- Social History: Information about the patient's home environment, education, employment, eating habits, activities, drug use, sexuality, and suicide/depression risk.\n- Review of Systems (ROS): A system-based list of questions to uncover symptoms not mentioned by the patient.\n\nObjective\nThis section documents objective data from the patient encounter. It includes:\n- Vital signs: Temperature, pulse, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels.\n- Physical exam findings: Details about the patient's general appearance, specific body systems examination, and any abnormalities found.\n- Laboratory data: Test results related to the case.\n- Imaging results: Results from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or other imaging tests.\n- Other diagnostic data: Any additional test results relevant to the case.\n\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes:\n- Problem list: A prioritized list of problems or diagnoses.\n- Differential Diagnosis: A list of potential diagnoses, ranked by likelihood.\n- Discussion: Explanation of the thought process behind the differential diagnosis.\n\nPlan\nThis section outlines the steps to address the patient's illnesses, including:\n- Testing needed and rationale for each test.\n- Therapy or medications prescribed.\n- Specialist referrals or consultations required.\n- Patient education and counseling needs.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe SOAP note serves as an essential tool in organizing patient information, aiding clinical reasoning, and improving communication between healthcare providers. The note's structure helps ensure that important information is not overlooked and makes it easier for colleagues to understand the case and follow the treatment plan. However, the SOAP note does have limitations, such as its inability to document changes over time, which could be addressed through extensions like the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation).\nResponse:  The generated SOAP note provided does not strictly adhere to the traditional format of a SOAP note for medical documentation. However, it attempts to use elements similar to the SOAP note structure to document progress in a non-medical context (in this case, training a patient on using voice commands for assistive technology).\n\nHere is how the generated SOAP note components compare to the target SOAP note:\n\n1. Subjective: The generated note does not have an explicit subjective section like the Target SOAP note. However, it provides some context in the introduction and under the \"P\" (Plan) section.\n\n2. Objective: The objective section of the generated note can be found in the VAT Sessions sections, where the patient's performance on specific tasks is documented.\n\n3. Assessment: The assessment section can be found in both the 3rd and 4th sections of the generated note, where the patient's response to user needs assessment and performance during the VAT sessions are evaluated.\n\n4. Plan: The plan is outlined in the final paragraph, detailing homework assignments, metacognitive strategies, and future session plans.\n\nWhile not a traditional SOAP note, the generated note does provide structured documentation of the training session, assesses the patient's performance, and outlines a plan for continued training. However, it deviates significantly from the Target SOAP note in terms of its structure and context (medical vs non-medical).\n\nA score of 5 would reflect a moderate difference between the generated and target SOAP notes, as they share some similarities but do not strictly adhere to the traditional format or context.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them.\n\nThe text describes each heading of a SOAP note:\n\n1. Subjective - This section includes the patient's personal views or feelings about their health status, as well as the context for the Assessment and Plan. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including therapy needed (medications), specialist referral(s) or consults, and patient education and counseling.\n\nThe text also mentions issues of concern, such as the order in which a medical note is written and the ability to document changes over time. It also discusses the clinical significance of SOAP notes in today's electronic documentation environment.\nResponse:  Based on the provided information, the generated SOAP note does not perfectly match the target SOAP note, but it closely resembles it. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. Subjective: The target SOAP note mentions the patient's excitement and eagerness (RT is excited, outgoing, and eager), while the generated SOAP note describes the patient as demonstrating heightened independence using Gemini to seek information that is meaningful to her and personal to her (RT demonstrated heightened independence). Both descriptions touch upon the patient's emotional state, although they are not identical.\n\n2. Objective: The target SOAP note does not provide objective data in this example as it pertains to a training session, not a medical examination. However, it does mention some specific actions taken during the session (navigating to Gemini, creating prompts, etc.). In contrast, the generated SOAP note does not contain any objective data either.\n\n3. Assessment: The target SOAP note assesses Rosie's progress in using Gemini for her ADLs and her ability to create meaningful prompts for the system. The generated SOAP note does not explicitly provide an assessment, but it hints at the patient's progress with Gemini by stating that this was the final training session.\n\n4. Plan: Both the target and generated SOAP notes suggest a follow-up to evaluate the patient's progress with Gemini (Follow up with RT to see how she is progressing).\n\nThe generated SOAP note deviates from the target in terms of structure, detail, and specificity. However, it effectively captures the essential elements of the training session and the patient's progress, which justifies a relatively low loss score.

MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes\u201d   \u201cAlexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  can  you  repeat?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes\u201d  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  check  off  gum\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese\u201d   \u201cRead  me  option  one\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  option  two\u201d  \u201cAlexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk\u201d  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what\u2019s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe\u201d  \u201cHey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?\u201d  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?\u201d   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance \u201cAlexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese\u201d led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command \u201c Alexa, read me option one\u201d led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA\u2019s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn\u2019t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  clear  my  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers\u201d   \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different\nQuery:  The conversation appears to be about the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Introduction: SOAP notes are a structured way for healthcare workers to document patient information, helping guide clinical reasoning and decision-making. The structure includes four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n2. Subjective: This section includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The CC is the reason for the visit, while the HPI provides context about the patient's symptoms. The HPI can be organized using the acronym OLDCARTS: Onset, Location, Duration, Characterization, Alleviating and Aggravating factors, Radiation, Temporal factor, and Severity.\n\n3. Objective: This section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data. It's important to distinguish between symptoms (subjective) and signs (objective).\n\n4. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\n5. Plan: This section details additional testing, consultant referrals, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed to address the patient's illnesses.\n\n6. Issues of Concern: While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it can be beneficial to rearrange the order for more efficient communication. However, the original order remains important as it provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. A weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time, and extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap.\nResponse:  Based on the provided target SOAP note, the generated SOAP note doesn't strictly follow the format. The generated note is more about a technology assessment for an individual named MA using Amazon Alexa (assistive device) in meal preparation rather than a healthcare encounter. However, I will try to map it to the SOAP note structure for comparison:\n\n1. Subjective:\n   - Chief Complaint (CC): MA wants to use Amazon Alexa for meal preparation and dietary assistance.\n   - History of Present Illness (HPI): MA's parents mostly do the cooking, but he sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.\n\n2. Objective: This section is not explicitly provided in the given text, but it could include the Alexa's abilities to connect to ICloud calendar on Echo Show and the user scenarios related to meal preparation and dietary restrictions.\n\n3. Assessment: The assessment highlights MA's needs and challenges, such as requiring verbal prompts from his mother for user scenarios, difficulties with multi-step commands, and issues with visual output due to blindness. Additionally, it mentions the need for accessibility modifications and recommending an Echo Dot without a screen for better usability.\n\n4. Plan: The plan suggests home exercise programs for MA, such as finding substitutions, recipes, ingredients, steps to follow a recipe, shopping lists, and caloric/nutritional information.\n\n5. Issues of Concern: The concern is about lack of verbal output and inability to use the device without accessibility modifications, which may require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist.\n\nThe generated SOAP note focuses on a technology assessment rather than a healthcare encounter, so it doesn't strictly follow the traditional SOAP note structure.

In contrast, the generated SOAP note seems to lack the Subjective and Objective sections, focusing only on Assessment and Plan for two different topics (Selfcare and Medical Needs, Meal Preparation).\n\nSince the target SOAP note includes detailed information about the patient's interaction and progress during the session, while the generated one is more focused on discussing specific actions taken related to the mentioned topics, I would assign a loss score of 5. This is because although there are differences in structure and content, they still convey information relevant to the patient encounter.\n\nA perfect match (score 0) would require the generated SOAP note to include all sections (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and provide detailed information about the patient's interaction and progress during the session, similar to the target SOAP note. A completely different SOAP note (score 10) would provide minimal or no relevant information related to the patient encounter.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The four headings of a SOAP note are:\n\n1. Subjective - This section documents the patient's personal views or feelings about their condition, known as the chief complaint (CC) and history of present illness (HPI). It also includes medical, surgical, family, social history, and review of systems (ROS).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes the subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including any necessary medications, specialist referrals or consults, and patient education.\n\nThe text also discusses issues of concern regarding the SOAP note, such as its inability to document changes over time and the potential for data-filled notes to burden healthcare providers if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy-to-find places, making it easier for clinicians to follow.\nResponse:  Based on the provided information, the generated SOAP note closely matches the target SOAP note. The subjective (S), objective (O), assessment (A), and plan (P) sections are all present and contain relevant information about the patient's condition, progress in therapy, identified needs, VAT session results, and homework assignment for the next week.\n\nHowever, there are a few differences between the two SOAP notes:\n\n1. In the target SOAP note, the goal is set for the patient to utilize concise voice commands to execute functional commands related to ADLs with 80% accuracy given moderate verbal cues. In the generated SOAP note, the goal is slightly rephrased, but the core intention remains the same: the patient was able to use concise voice commands in 80% of trials to create medication lists, set alarms/reminders, and inquire about health-related info on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues.\n\n2. In the target SOAP note, there is a specific mention of technical difficulties at the beginning of the session and troubleshooting steps taken to resolve these issues. This detail is not present in the generated SOAP note.\n\n3. In the target SOAP note, the patient's PLOF (Passive Range of Motion) and LUE dominance are mentioned under User Needs, while in the generated SOAP note, this information is not provided.\n\nOverall, the differences between the two SOAP notes are minor, and I would rate the loss score as 2 out of 10. The generated SOAP note closely follows the structure and content of the target SOAP note, making it a valuable summary of the patient's progress and needs in the therapy session.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Developed by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago, this structure provides a framework for evaluating information, cognitive aid, and potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.\n\nFunction\nThe SOAP note consists of four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThe Subjective section documents the patient's personal views or feelings, interim information, and context for the assessment and plan. It includes Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The HPI begins with a simple opening statement including the patient's age, sex, and reason for the visit.\n\nObjective\nThe Objective section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, other diagnostic data, and recognition of other clinicians' documentation.\n\nAssessment\nThe Assessment section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes the problem list, differential diagnosis, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\nPlan\nThe Plan section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed (medications).\n\nIssues of Concern\nA weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time. To address this gap, extensions to the SOAP model include acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E reminding to assess how well the plan has worked.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe advantage of a SOAP note is organizing relevant information for easy access and quick understanding. It helps clinicians follow the document more efficiently, making it essential for communication between healthcare professionals. However, electronic documentation risks burdening busy clinicians with excessive data, necessitating the need to make the most clinically relevant data easily accessible and immediately available.\n\nConclusion\nThe SOAP note is an essential tool for healthcare providers, ensuring organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation of patient information. Its adoption has simplified communication between healthcare professionals, improving overall care and outcomes.\nResponse:  Based on the provided target and generated SOAP notes, the score would be approximately 3 out of 10. The target SOAP note is focused on a clinical case study, while the generated SOAP note discusses the SOAP note system itself as a tool for healthcare documentation and communication. The generated SOAP note does not directly match the format or content of the target SOAP note. However, it does provide valuable information about the purpose, structure, and significance of SOAP notes in healthcare, which could be useful context for understanding the target SOAP note's format. To better align with the target SOAP note, a revised version would focus on a specific clinical case study using the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) structure.\n\nRevised SOAP Note:\nTitle: SOAP Notes: Gemini/Alexa Summer Training Session\n\nIntroduction\nThe following is an example of a SOAP note documenting a training session using voice assistive technology (VAT) tools, specifically Alexa and Google Gemini, to gather information on current events. The session focused on topics like Texas Flooding and Biotechnology.\n\nSubjective\nPatient, a 45-year-old female, presented for a 1-hour research session as part of the Gemini/Alexa summer training program. Patient was engaged and eager to participate in the session. The patient has been diagnosed with speech and language challenges, which were observed during the session.\n\nObjective\nDuring the session, the patient engaged with VAT tools (Alexa and Google Gemini) to gather information on topics of interest and current events. The patient's verbal output was often slurred and used filler words (e.g., \"like\", \"um\", \"uh\"), and incomplete sentences; however, her communicative intent was generally clear. She showed some difficulty reading prompts from the powerpoint aloud and occasionally stumbled over words. Despite these challenges, she was able to express a detailed, though disorganized, summary of news content. Visual input was helpful, and the patient expressed that Gemini was easier to understand than Alexa due to its more concise responses and visual output of information.\n\nAssessment\nThe patient demonstrated an ability to use VAT tools for research purposes, with improvements in her ability to construct prompts for seeking information. However, her speech remains disfluent and slurred at times with reduced clarity. The patient benefits from structured models and prompting to improve her creation of prompts for VAT/AI tools.\n\nPlan\nRecommendations include continuing structured practice using AI tools (Alexa and Google Gemini), finishing the creation of a Gemini account, and practicing constructing Prompts for seeking information. Incorporate visuals to support memory and the creation of prompts during sessions to further improve the patient's ability to use VAT/AI tools effectively.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?\u201d  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  \u201cTrazadone\u201d  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week\u2019s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. \u201cIs there a fact you would like to know?\u201d) M.A. practice the following commands: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?\u201d  -  \u201c Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cFor  the  gym\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?\u201d  -  \u201cAlexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?\u201d   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying \u201csuch as___\u201d to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.\u2019s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as \u201cWho do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?\u201d  and  \u201cIs  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?\u201d.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  news  and  facts.  Please  practice  these  five commands with your Alexa. Record each command you practice and then submit it to researchers  Task  1:  Telling  Joke  1.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  a  joke\u201d   Task  2:  Asking  for  the  Weather  2.  \u201cAlexa,  what\u2019s  the  weather?\u201d   Task  3:  Asking  for  News  3.  \u201cAlexa,  play  flash  briefing\u201d   Task  4:  Searching  for  Information  4.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  where  I  can  buy  cold  medicine\u201d  5.  \u201cAlexa,  where  is  the  nearest  gas  station?\u201d  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different\nQuery:  In response to your request for a SOAP note on the topic \"Ensuring the structure and style of the provided text follows the rubric for a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note\", I have provided an example SOAP note below:\n\nTitle: Ensuring the Structure and Style of Text Follows the Rubric for a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) Note\n\nSubjective\nChief Complaint (CC): Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI): The text does not follow the required structure and style of a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nHistory: No pertinent past medical history is mentioned.\nReview of Systems (ROS): Not applicable as no symptoms or conditions have been reported.\nCurrent Medications, Allergies: Not applicable as no medications or allergies have been documented.\n\nObjective\nVital signs: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPhysical exam findings: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nLaboratory data: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nImaging results: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nRecognition and review of documentation of other clinicians: The text does not demonstrate adherence to the SOAP note structure, indicating a lack of collaboration and shared understanding among healthcare providers.\n\nAssessment\nProblem: Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style, leading to inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nDifferential Diagnosis: It is unclear if there are other underlying issues contributing to the lack of adherence to the SOAP note structure and style.\nDiscussion: The text demonstrates a lack of understanding or adherence to the required structure and style for a SOAP note, making it difficult to quickly understand the patient's status and the assessment and plan for their care.\n\nPlan\nTesting needed: Educational interventions to teach proper documentation techniques in accordance with the SOAP note rubric.\nTherapy needed (medications): Not applicable as medications are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults: Not applicable as specialists are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPatient education, counseling: Provide educational materials on the importance and benefits of using a SOAP note structure, along with training on proper documentation techniques.\n\nThe text provided does not follow the required structure and style for a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation. To address this issue, it is recommended to provide educational interventions to teach proper documentation techniques in accordance with the SOAP note rubric, along with training on proper documentation techniques. Additionally, providing educational materials on the importance and benefits of using a SOAP note structure may help encourage adherence to the required format.\nResponse:  The generated SOAP note closely matches the target SOAP note. There are some minor differences, but overall, the structure and style follow the rubric for a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the similarities and differences:\n\nSubjective: The generated SOAP note does not have a specific section for the patient's name, but this is not essential in the provided context. The HPI (History of Present Illness) section in the generated SOAP note covers the patient's interactions during the session well.\n\nObjective: The Objective section in the generated SOAP note is not necessary as it focuses on describing the actions performed during the session rather than physical examination findings or laboratory data.\n\nAssessment: The Assessment section in the generated SOAP note provides a clear evaluation of M.A.'s performance during the session and identifies areas for improvement (expansion on utterances and slowing down speech rate).\n\nPlan: The Plan section in the generated SOAP note outlines specific actions to address the identified issues, such as homework assignments focusing on practicing certain commands.\n\nHomework Assignment: This section is not a standard part of a SOAP note but provides practical steps for M.A. to work on expanding his utterances and slowing down his speech rate.\n\nOverall, I would give a score of 2 or 3 out of 10, as there are minor differences between the generated and target SOAP notes, but the structure and style follow the SOAP note rubric closely.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Here's a summary:\n\nThe SOAP note is a structured method of documenting patient encounters that helps healthcare workers assess, diagnose, and treat patients effectively. It consists of four sections: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n1. **Subjective**: This section contains the patient's subjective experiences, personal views, or feelings about their condition. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI), which provides context for the assessment and plan.\n\n2. **Objective**: This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. **Assessment**: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, lists the problem, differential diagnoses, and discusses the plan for each problem.\n\n4. **Plan**: This section details the need for additional testing, specialist referrals, patient education, counseling, and any therapy needed (medications).\n\nThe SOAP note helps improve communication among healthcare professionals and ensures a comprehensive and efficient assessment and treatment plan for patients. However, it does have some limitations, such as the inability to document changes over time effectively. Extensions to the SOAP model, like SOAPE, have been proposed to address this gap.\n\nIn the provided conversation, the subjective information includes the patient's chief complaint (chest pain) and history of present illness (describing the chest pain). The objective information might include findings from a physical exam or laboratory tests. The assessment could involve considering potential causes for the chest pain based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, and the plan might involve ordering further tests or prescribing medication.\nResponse:  Based on your description, the generated SOAP note is not a direct match with the target SOAP note. However, it seems that you have transformed the conversation between the AI and the user into a SOAP note format for educational purposes, which is an interesting and creative approach!\n\nThe main differences between the two SOAP notes lie in their focus and context. The target SOAP note focuses on self-care needs, while the generated SOAP note simulates a clinical encounter regarding chest pain. In terms of structure, the generated SOAP note follows the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) format, while the target SOAP note discusses self-care tools such as Alexa, Gemini, and Meta Glasses for different scenarios.\n\nTo quantify the differences between the two SOAP notes, I would assign a score of 7 out of 10, considering that they are focused on distinct topics and follow different formats despite sharing the same structure. If we were to compare them based solely on their adherence to the SOAP note format, the score would be lower (4 out of 10), since the target SOAP note is more specific to self-care needs.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET:   Subjective  (S):  MA  logged  in  for  the  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes\u201d   \u201cAlexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  can  you  repeat?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes\u201d  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  check  off  gum\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese\u201d   \u201cRead  me  option  one\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  option  two\u201d  \u201cAlexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk\u201d  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what\u2019s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe\u201d  \u201cHey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?\u201d  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?\u201d   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance \u201cAlexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese\u201d led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command \u201c Alexa, read me option one\u201d led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA\u2019s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn\u2019t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  clear  my  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers\u201d   \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT>  The conversation appears to be about the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Introduction: SOAP notes are a structured way for healthcare workers to document patient information, helping guide clinical reasoning and decision-making. The structure includes four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n2. Subjective: This section includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The CC is the reason for the visit, while the HPI provides context about the patient's symptoms. The HPI can be organized using the acronym OLDCARTS: Onset, Location, Duration, Characterization, Alleviating and Aggravating factors, Radiation, Temporal factor, and Severity.\n\n3. Objective: This section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data. It's important to distinguish between symptoms (subjective) and signs (objective).\n\n4. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\n5. Plan: This section details additional testing, consultant referrals, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed to address the patient's illnesses.\n\n6. Issues of Concern: While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it can be beneficial to rearrange the order for more efficient communication. However, the original order remains important as it provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. A weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time, and extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  Based on the provided target SOAP note, the generated SOAP note doesn't strictly follow the format. The generated note is more about a technology assessment for an individual named MA using Amazon Alexa (assistive device) in meal preparation rather than a healthcare encounter. However, I will try to map it to the SOAP note structure for comparison:\n\n1. Subjective:\n   - Chief Complaint (CC): MA wants to use Amazon Alexa for meal preparation and dietary assistance.\n   - History of Present Illness (HPI): MA's parents mostly do the cooking, but he sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.\n\n2. Objective: This section is not explicitly provided in the given text, but it could include the Alexa's abilities to connect to ICloud calendar on Echo Show and the user scenarios related to meal preparation and dietary restrictions.\n\n3. Assessment: The assessment highlights MA's needs and challenges, such as requiring verbal prompts from his mother for user scenarios, difficulties with multi-step commands, and issues with visual output due to blindness. Additionally, it mentions the need for accessibility modifications and recommending an Echo Dot without a screen for better usability.\n\n4. Plan: The plan suggests home exercise programs for MA, such as finding substitutions, recipes, ingredients, steps to follow a recipe, shopping lists, and caloric/nutritional information.\n\n5. Issues of Concern: The concern is about lack of verbal output and inability to use the device without accessibility modifications, which may require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist.\n\nThe generated SOAP note focuses on a technology assessment rather than a healthcare encounter, so it doesn't strictly follow the traditional SOAP note structure. A score of 5 would be appropriate for the differences between the target and generated SOAP notes. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-15-2024 (Week 5) M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Clinician\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient R.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Clinician\nSpeaker 11: Clinician\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 12: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver\nSpeaker 13: Clinician\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:02 Speaker 1\nPerfect. I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems.

While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  The conversation appears to be about the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Introduction: SOAP notes are a structured way for healthcare workers to document patient information, helping guide clinical reasoning and decision-making. The structure includes four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n2. Subjective: This section includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The CC is the reason for the visit, while the HPI provides context about the patient's symptoms. The HPI can be organized using the acronym OLDCARTS: Onset, Location, Duration, Characterization, Alleviating and Aggravating factors, Radiation, Temporal factor, and Severity.\n\n3. Objective: This section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data. It's important to distinguish between symptoms (subjective) and signs (objective).\n\n4. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\n5. Plan: This section details additional testing, consultant referrals, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed to address the patient's illnesses.\n\n6. Issues of Concern: While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it can be beneficial to rearrange the order for more efficient communication. However, the original order remains important as it provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. A weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time, and extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

However, it could benefit from adding more specific feedback on the variable of interest, which pertains to the structure and organization of the generated SOAP note.\n\nA possible improvement would be for the language model to address the discrepancy between the target and generated SOAP notes by comparing them directly. Here's an example:\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> Based on the provided target SOAP note, the generated SOAP note has some differences in structure and organization. While it touches upon the key components of Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP), it lacks a clear distinction between sections and sometimes combines them. For instance, the 'Issues of Concern' section could be better separated as part of the Assessment or Plan section.\n\nTo improve the SOAP note structure, it would be beneficial to ensure that each section is clearly delineated, with proper headings and indentations for easy readability. Additionally, focusing on a specific problem and presenting solutions in a step-by-step manner could make the generated SOAP note more effective as a clinical communication tool.\n\nExtensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address the challenge of documenting changes over time in the original SOAP format. Integrating these extensions might be worth considering for future iterations, as they can improve the documentation process further. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nBy providing more specific feedback on the structure and organization of the generated SOAP note, the language model's response would be more actionable and helpful in addressing the objective function of improving the variable. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. Subjective: The target SOAP note mentions the patient's excitement and eagerness (RT is excited, outgoing, and eager), while the generated SOAP note describes the patient as demonstrating heightened independence using Gemini to seek information that is meaningful to her and personal to her (RT demonstrated heightened independence). Both descriptions touch upon the patient's emotional state, although they are not identical.\n\n2. Objective: The target SOAP note does not provide objective data in this example as it pertains to a training session, not a medical examination. However, it does mention some specific actions taken during the session (navigating to Gemini, creating prompts, etc.). In contrast, the generated SOAP note does not contain any objective data either.\n\n3. Assessment: The target SOAP note assesses Rosie's progress in using Gemini for her ADLs and her ability to create meaningful prompts for the system. The generated SOAP note does not explicitly provide an assessment, but it hints at the patient's progress with Gemini by stating that this was the final training session.\n\n4. Plan: Both the target and generated SOAP notes suggest a follow-up to evaluate the patient's progress with Gemini (Follow up with RT to see how she is progressing).\n\nThe generated SOAP note deviates from the target in terms of structure, detail, and specificity. However, it effectively captures the essential elements of the training session and the patient's progress, which justifies a relatively low loss score. I would assign a score of 3 out of 10 for this exercise. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan.

Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago.

Seeking. And just seeking any information that we're curious about. And so let's find 2 activities related to this topic and practice in putting it to Gemini. And then stop sharing and then I'll have you take over R and go ahead and share your screen. Are you able to flip your Gemini?  00:00:56 Speaker 2  I'm trying to load it, but I think it's like showing like. UM. It's like not letting my e-mail not use it. So it says service not allowed.  00:01:09 Speaker 3  My bank to Gmail to.  00:01:11 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's in my personal e-mail. Yeah, need to. Tenses. OK. Can you guys see it says Hello, R, on there.  00:01:53 Speaker 1  I cannot. Maybe can you stop sharing and reshare? Maybe it needs to?  00:02:01 Speaker 2  Alright. Hello.  00:02:15 Speaker 1  Now yes. Alright, so for information seeking topic, is there a topic of interest you'd like to ask Gemini?  00:02:28 Speaker 2  Yes, they. The middle of summer. So like. Well, you know, I live in South Orange County, so we're like the US open is surfing is coming up. So like, let's see like when I know, I know that's always Huntington Beach main beach. But I don't know what time when.  00:02:46 Speaker 1  Oh yeah, that\u2019s a great question to ask Gemini.  00:02:51 Speaker 2  Because. So it's it's it's fun to people watch.  00:02:57 Speaker 1  I'm actually thinking about going.  00:02:59 Speaker 2  Yeah, so I was. Just walking up and down main and. Just like these people. Ohh no, she kicked the Huntington, then the 22nd through. August Spaghetti in August.  00:03:42 Speaker 1  Is there anything? Is there any more information you would like to know about the US Open?  00:03:47 Speaker 2  Yeah, because there's like this coming week to like 2 weeks. So what? Maybe I can answer. More facts about this. Here she has. Is what I feel like.  00:04:53 Speaker 1  OK, so it gives you the dates for. The long board components.  00:04:57 Speaker 2  Like I like, you know, some people like those little carvers like longboards, fun to ride is. I'm not. I'm not really a big surfer, but just like finding cruising. Yeah, like to see that, you know, main beach honey, she has his son has a tourist trap. But just watching be fun.  00:05:17 Speaker 1  Is there any important information that you'd like to know before going to see the longboards? Maybe something that Jim and I didn't say?  00:05:26 Speaker 2  They're really nice. Like location, actual location. It's just honey beach. So like Main Beach is a long place, like where you know, it's like they ask like what? What side of the pier or something like location.  00:05:42 Speaker 1  Yeah, or where to park or something?  00:05:44 Speaker 2  And where to park, Well, like it's giving a lot, this is just, you know, just type them into like my apple maps or something and pull into like, the main beach parking promenade is easy to get through and some of them like. One street over. We gotta pay for him. So it's. Like. Whenever you drive down there, see well, people go down and sneak around backside. So it's like good to have these suggestions to go through.  00:07:01 Speaker 1  Yeah, for sure. I feel like this is all really helpful that we could like. Put in our Apple maps.  00:07:11 Speaker 2  Yeah, I'm going to park there sometimes like. So maybe like Ohh park around that corner like 1 you walk, walk over one night, walk over to the beach or. No, there's a good steak fish Taco place down the aisle. You just sneak over.  00:07:29 Speaker 1  And that's another thing you could ask too, right?  00:07:35 Speaker 2 Yes.  00:07:36 Speaker 1  I know they only have a lot of vendors, right?  00:07:38 Speaker 2  They did have better for like the main pier antenna stalls up. You know, the Main Street, they got all those like little restaurants and they got parts out front carts out front. It's like sometimes, like when you sometimes surfing is early in the morning, you get a burrito one hand.  00:08:33 Speaker 1  Yeah, the best thing is in the morning.  00:08:36 Speaker 2  Yeah, like those people down here at the wage Newport, they're up. Daybreak. I'm just like. Going to bed.  00:08:49 Speaker 1  All right. Shock. 00:08:55 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's yeah, serious.  00:08:57 Speaker 1  You want to Scroll down and see what else.  00:09:00 Speaker 2  And sandy?  00:09:02 Speaker 1  Sandies.  00:09:06 Speaker 2  Water table. Water table is more a little high end. But it's it's good if you're with a group of. People that want it.  00:09:24 Speaker 1  Pacific hideaway.  00:09:26 Speaker 2  I think. Actually these are main off Main beach. So right there when you go that way, you see the right your left brake on the wave and you go there Scooter, scooter over the house coffee house so it's like. So.  00:09:46 Speaker 1  602.  00:09:47 Speaker 2  Except here. It's not. That was last time I went to 602. It just got like little raps. How much gonna walk right over?To the boardwalk and just like. It's good, like, you know, some nice and honey. Then when they have like the like, the farmers market out front on the main 602 walk right over memory.  00:10:12 Speaker 1  Yeah, and still check. Grab and go. You can like bring. It to the sand.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  I just remember I just. I've gone over to Huntington, down to the Woodies and it's good. Like. We have like a. BLT and just go watch ways good. It's good like thinking about later this summer.  00:10:38 Speaker 1  Yeah. These are great options. I think you can definitely save this chat for summer day.  00:10:44 Speaker 2  Yeah, this outfit.  00:10:45 Speaker 1  Whenever you want to go. Through the long boarding competitions.  00:10:48 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:10:49 Speaker 1  OK, we can move on to the next topic we discussed over the training. So the next thing we did was entertainment to get information related to media, listening to music, watching movies. Maybe even have Gemini generate stories or tell jokes or create trivia games. Is there a topic in entertainment that you would like to ask tonight?  00:11:21 Speaker 2  You know, like, you know, sarcasm people like like, it's funny or something fall flat, but sometimes like. After my injury, I take it straight. Serious but like even the one of my things before my injury, I knew sarcasm like that. So if you wait, I can ask her about. They sometimes people, maybe Gemini and I would have a good one, but like sarcasm jokes here one day and it worked out.  00:11:50 Speaker 1  Yeah, that'd be that'd be good for entertainment and.  00:11:53 Speaker 2  Like you know, entering the conversation, you're just just throw joke at people you know or just like. What is that?  00:12:02 Speaker 1  Yeah, I think that's a great topic to see what Gemini says.  00:12:06 Speaker 2  Ask her.  00:12:07 Speaker 1  Yeah. That one's good.  00:12:48 Speaker 2  Here's the funny. Why did this have her break up with the ocean cause like people like break up as a relationship? Because he was feeling like he was just going through the motions like he had like a relationship like the other person is. I'm just going through the motions. It's funny.  00:13:12 Speaker 1  Do you wanna? Ask for more jokes. Maybe even ask like, do you want them about surfing? Or you can pick a topic as well.  00:13:20 Speaker 2  Him on the topic because we were just talking about surfing earlier, so.  00:13:24 Speaker 1  Yeah, that's it. Perfect. You can maybe use that on Saturday.  00:14:01 Speaker 2  Because this weekend I'm going bowling with like a group of people. So like our cousin. Stop playing cards.  00:14:08 Speaker 1  That's fine.  00:14:14 Speaker 2  Because they heard the strikes were ragged.  00:14:21 Speaker 1  It's a busy weekend, bowling and surfing.  00:14:24 Speaker 2  I just like, well, I'm just watching surfing. They're like, well, I think that we're gonna probably go to. To see the longboarding next weekend, but this weekend I have the serving date so I just.So it's because the strikes were rigged. Trying to make it think about it.  00:14:47 Speaker 1  You know, me too, I'm. I know that the born straight.  00:14:50 Speaker 2  Stroke, he says. I can hit him all, but strikes rate.  00:14:55 Speaker 1  But I don't know much about cards. I wonder if there's a connection there somewhere.  00:14:59 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, I know basic card games. So this is like kind of in between for me.  00:15:07 Speaker 1  Maybe you could ask Gemini to explain the joke. I wonder what Gemini would say. Oh, I get it.  00:15:45 Speaker 2  There's strike like they do a strike.  00:15:50 Speaker 1  I I told her that went over my head.  00:15:53 Speaker 2  You mean on my head right now? So he asked her.  00:15:57 Speaker 1  OK, I get it. Well, at least Gemini and. I provided a really good explanation.  00:16:02 Speaker 2  You know, ask her why I like using her as like exchange the point like that. Like if I told that girl over there like said, she'd probably be like, get her busy. Hey. Explaining.  00:16:22 Speaker 1  I think that's a good. Saves. I know that you were telling me earlier that like, sometimes sarcasm is challenging for you to understand. Maybe if someone did say something. Like I can't. Talk like sarcastic or not like maybe. You can like. It's like ask Gemini. Can you explain this and then maybe? Why would people to provide like a more in depth explanation? That's funny. I totally that went over my head. I was like, I don't. I don't get it. I'm not laughing.  00:16:51 Speaker 2  You know, like, so these people like some people. Staying is how like it's trained on normal joke. Sometimes those go over your head too, but I can just like it's fun to everything but sarcasm. It's good to get back into.  00:17:07 Speaker 1  Yeah, definitely. Sometimes I don't understand. Sarcasm, I'm like. Are you are you being mean, are you? Like, are you being serious or like that? It's really hard to tell.  00:17:18 Speaker 2  It's like. So this is delivery like you sometimes right there. So you got a chip on your shoulder, that's sarcasm or if you just saying it straight on. Then that's you have been realized realistic with it. But see how you deliver it like you could shrug your shoulders. Of the like weird look at your face out there trying to take you out.  00:17:43 Speaker 1  Yeah. So looking at body.  00:17:47 Speaker 2  Cute, yeah.  00:17:48 Speaker 1  Body movements or Felix questions can kind of help you understand if it's sarcasm, but it's like Gemini. Honestly understand sarcasm. So you're very confused. You can ask them.  00:17:58 Speaker 2  He does.  00:18:01 Speaker 1  All right. And let's go to our next topic. That was self-care and medical needs, so. I know you're really good about taking your medication because you have your pill box, but maybe we can search for. Self keratin.  00:18:24 Speaker 2  OK.  00:18:26 Speaker 1  Or ways to improve our mental or physical health. What sounds most helpful or useful to you?  00:18:34 Speaker 2  Like self-care, like mental and physical health, just like mindset thing. Just.  00:18:41 Speaker 1  Remember, last time we did yoga?  00:18:42 Speaker 2  Yeah, yoga was going on that maybe there's something else you can pick.  00:18:46 Speaker 1  Yeah, maybe there's something else, that Gemma I can provide. Yeah. OK, so some breathing.  00:20:04 Speaker 2  You. Techniques. Yeah, I need to like actually implement the. I've heard about them and. I actually do them.  00:20:11 Speaker 1  Yeah, these are good. I like box breathing.  00:20:15 Speaker 2  Up there, up there, yeah.  00:20:18 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:20:20 Speaker 2  Count to 4.  00:20:24 Speaker 1  That one works really. Well, yeah.Mindfulness and meditation.  00:20:42 Speaker 2  Yeah. And like some of this. Well made neuro. Psych tells me about, like, living in the present and like. Even now not then or where you are, so it's like and also doing the full body scan like how you're carrying yourself and like eye contact. To. Judge yourself. The mirror is supposed to be. Your best friend, not like. You know good.  00:21:14 Speaker 1  Physical activity.  00:21:18 Speaker 2  Kind of like basic exercises and well, just, you know, being outdoors in the environment, just like nature, sounds, sounds and like peaceful. Like, you know, I love watching surfing and going to the beach and stuff, you know, walking on sand. It's always like just your nature. Like, the the breezes and like. I just like being outside, so just walking on the beach.Is always fun.  00:21:41 Speaker 1  Me too. That's one of my favorite self-care activities.  00:21:45 Speaker 2  Eating.  00:21:52 Speaker 1  And what's #4? Engage your senses and creativity.  00:21:57 Speaker 2  And also, just an animal snuck in there, like almost ready. Like I love it. So people bring their dogs to the beach. But like some dogs.  00:22:00 Speaker 1  Yeah, put an animal. Otherwise. Sounds, maybe you can set them. On the beach.  00:22:10 Speaker 2  Are not friendly. Some dogs hang out with their master only, but some really they come and sniff over to your brother nose right in your lap. But it's. Like. They're like humans. Social or not, saying this is like. Aromatherapy what smells is good, like sometimes name sense, like camomile, lavender, stitch just really soothing, but something he smells something else like. They got a cup of coffee like ohh I need to work. It's like sit there but they really fills your mind. Tell what you want to do. Like relax or go to work. Therapies. Good to check into, yeah.  00:23:03 Speaker 1  And then the fifth one, adjusting habits and mindset.  00:23:10 Speaker 2  Oh yeah, somebody's just for overall life screen time. Like I'm talking to you guys, but.After.  Off because like a bunch of their generation on the phone. Streamed TikTok. Ohh, you know, a lot of these therapies. And like talking to people, FaceTime or like talking you guys on zoom and stuff, a lot of interaction is digital. So it's like, oh, I think that we're probably getting used to this. All this is saying blue light to your eye or whatever. Yeah. Like this is kind of bad for your brain, but. Did it come back and it?  00:23:51 Speaker 1  I know that's why I wear my glasses so much more than wearing contacts because they have blue light in them because I'm always on my computer, I feel like.  00:23:56 Speaker 2  Oh. Probably, And also like having mentioned here. Diet, sleep. Those are important for your brain and overall health like. Get my. No, no, I take 9 hours of sleep, but I got a regular basis and my I'm ready to go and also eat my 3 meals and. Different mindset, yeah.  00:24:27 Speaker 1  Yeah, definitely. And.I think that it may be time to go back to the main room. I think we're ending our breakout rooms, is that correct? Doctor, you're heading back.  00:24:36 Speaker 2  OK.  00:24:42 Speaker 3  I was thinking if you're done, would you like to just directly go into individual feedback since we're in the room right now? Has some some questions we can go through. And since R, we don't have your mom with you. We'll just ask you, your individual feedback about. Yeah. Are you OK with that?  00:25:06 Speaker 2  Uh, yes, I can actually tell her to come in. But.  00:25:08 Speaker 3  OK. Maybe we'll do your portion first and then we'll come back. That sounds good.  00:25:14 Speaker 5  OK, I think I'm going to jump in and start on the questions. R with the feedback so first of all, thank you so much for participating. It was just great to be working with you. And I I really like the way you. I don't know made that made the AI experience personal for yourself. So was it easy or difficult for you to use your AI? Why don't you give us a one to five scale? You know where one is super easy and five is super difficult.  00:25:36 Speaker 2  Yeah. Well, maybe it's not a two because like I started with Gemini, she's kind of giving me some vague answers. You know, uh, well, it was Alexa kind of hit or miss. But Gemini is more good amount of detail, but Alexa is kind of. Rod is good for something. It's like shopping list. Wake up and like give her my, like tell me. Oh, I got PT in 45 minutes. She'll give. Remind me of stuff like that. But Shannon is more deeper answers. So I like the difference between those two.  00:26:32 Speaker 5  OK, so it sounds. Like. They are different for they're. Good for different reasons that.OK. And it was fairly easy for you to learn how?  00:26:39 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  00:26:42 Speaker 5  To use it.  00:26:45 Speaker 2  And yes cause. A big portion of our our life right now is getting digital. So it's like need to get with it.  00:26:53 Speaker 5  OK, what specific problems did you have with Jim and I, for instance, specific problems with like vocabulary. Did I understand your questions? Does she understand your? I'll call is she. Does she understand language? Was it? And if you did have problems, was it easy? To fix the problems.  00:27:14 Speaker 2  I think it was easy to fix like when I gave follow up questions about like you're talking about the the surf contest earlier where well about like the long board at the open and just like she probably in her little computer brain. I just asked about that. So she knows how to refer back to it.   , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  The provided text discusses the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them.\n\nThe text describes each heading of a SOAP note:\n\n1. Subjective - This section includes the patient's personal views or feelings about their health status, as well as the context for the Assessment and Plan. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including therapy needed (medications), specialist referral(s) or consults, and patient education and counseling.\n\nThe text also mentions issues of concern, such as the order in which a medical note is written and the ability to document changes over time. It also discusses the clinical significance of SOAP notes in today's electronic documentation environment. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  To enhance the response from the language model, the following suggestions can be considered:\n\n1. Provide a clear and concise definition of SOAP notes for readers who may not be familiar with this medical documentation method. For instance: \"SOAP is an acronym that stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. It is a widely used structure for documenting patient encounters in healthcare.\"\n\n2. Offer additional context on the target SOAP note, such as the specific type of training session it pertains to or any notable characteristics about Rosie (the patient). This will help create a more vivid and engaging narrative. For example: \"This SOAP note is from a Gemini/Alexa summer training session for an outgoing and eager individual named Rosie.\"\n\n3. Explain the importance of SOAP notes in today's electronic documentation environment, citing real-world examples or studies if possible. This will not only provide valuable information but also establish the language model as a reliable source of medical documentation knowledge. For instance: \"The use of SOAP notes has become even more crucial in the era of electronic health records, as it facilitates communication among healthcare providers and ensures standardization of documentation across various settings.\"\n\n4. Elaborate on the differences between the target SOAP note and the generated SOAP note, focusing on key aspects such as structure, detail, and specificity. This will help the reader understand the language model's strengths and areas for improvement. For example: \"Though the generated SOAP note effectively captures the essential elements of the training session and the patient's progress, it could benefit from a more structured format similar to that of the target SOAP note.\"\n\n5. Offer constructive feedback on the language model's performance, while encouraging further learning and development. This will foster a positive and productive relationship between the language model and its users. For example: \"The generated SOAP note demonstrates promising potential in accurately capturing patient encounters, but with continued training and refinement, it can produce even more detailed and structured notes that closely match target SOAP notes.\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions into future responses from the language model, the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION> of providing informative, engaging, and accurate medical documentation will be better achieved. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation. Specifically, give feedback to the following span of text:\n\n<VARIABLE> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a (...) note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </VARIABLE>\n\nGiven the above history, describe how the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses could be improved to improve the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>. Be very creative, critical, and intelligent.\n\n", "message": "_backward_through_llm prompt"}

S:  RT  arrived  to  the  session  on  time,  motivated  and  ready  to  participate  in  the  training.   O   1.  User  Needs:  Pt  identified  movies  trending  in  the  box  office  as  one  type  of  entertainment she enjoys and seeks out. Pt identified two technology/tools she currently uses for entertainment activities including a laptop or cellphone to utilize Youtube, scroll through social media to see what friends are doing, and to access Spotify to listen to music. Pt identified 8/10 scenarios to complete the   2.  VAT  Session:  Pt  utilized  voice  commands  to  manipulate  video  play  and  playback  on  the Alexa device in 15/17 trials in a 1:1 setting with the clinician given minimal verbal cues.   A:   3.  User  Needs:  Rosie  appropriately  responded  to  all  user  needs  assessment  interview  questions. During user needs assessment, pt was thoughtful and thorough when responding to each question. Pt independently identified appropriate scenarios related to personal entertainment use (i.e., watching Youtube playlist of the show, \u201cWIPE OUT,\u201d playing an audio book, asking about the weather, playing one artist\u2019s songs from a specific decade).   4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  met  her  goal  of  using  concise  voice  commands  in  80%  of  trials  to  set a timer on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues. Pt demonstrated intelligible speech when verbalizing Alexa voice commands and executed 15 commands successfully and independently given an initial model. One command, \u201cfast forward\u201d on Alexa was not supported and unable to be executed for this reason. In a group setting, pt demonstrated appropriate paralinguistic and pragmatic responses to other participants\u2019 successes with executing commands via head nods and encouraging comments.   P:  Week  2  homework  will  be  assigned.  Metacognitive  strategy  will  be  implemented  in  next  week\u2019s session to allow pt to reflect and provide feedback on use of Alexa throughout the week to discuss Alexa use for personal needs and ADLs.       \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT>  Speaker: Assistant\nRole: Healthcare Provider\nSource: Medical Documentation\n\nIntroduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare, providing a structured framework for evaluating patient information. This document will detail the components of a SOAP note and its significance in clinical practice.\n\nFunction\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThis section documents the subjective experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient. It provides context for the Assessment and Plan sections. Key components include:\n- Chief Complaint (CC): The patient's reported symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or statement describing why they are presenting.\n- History of Present Illness (HPI): A detailed account of the patient's CC, organized using the OLDCARTS acronym.\n- Medical history: Current or past medical conditions relevant to the case.\n- Surgical history: Important surgeries and their details.\n- Family history: Pertinent family medical history.\n- Social History: Information about the patient's home environment, education, employment, eating habits, activities, drug use, sexuality, and suicide/depression risk.\n- Review of Systems (ROS): A system-based list of questions to uncover symptoms not mentioned by the patient.\n\nObjective\nThis section documents objective data from the patient encounter. It includes:\n- Vital signs: Temperature, pulse, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels.\n- Physical exam findings: Details about the patient's general appearance, specific body systems examination, and any abnormalities found.\n- Laboratory data: Test results related to the case.\n- Imaging results: Results from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or other imaging tests.\n- Other diagnostic data: Any additional test results relevant to the case.\n\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes:\n- Problem list: A prioritized list of problems or diagnoses.\n- Differential Diagnosis: A list of potential diagnoses, ranked by likelihood.\n- Discussion: Explanation of the thought process behind the differential diagnosis.\n\nPlan\nThis section outlines the steps to address the patient's illnesses, including:\n- Testing needed and rationale for each test.\n- Therapy or medications prescribed.\n- Specialist referrals or consultations required.\n- Patient education and counseling needs.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe SOAP note serves as an essential tool in organizing patient information, aiding clinical reasoning, and improving communication between healthcare providers. The note's structure helps ensure that important information is not overlooked and makes it easier for colleagues to understand the case and follow the treatment plan. However, the SOAP note does have limitations, such as its inability to document changes over time, which could be addressed through extensions like the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation). </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  The generated SOAP note provided does not strictly adhere to the traditional format of a SOAP note for medical documentation. However, it attempts to use elements similar to the SOAP note structure to document progress in a non-medical context (in this case, training a patient on using voice commands for assistive technology).\n\nHere is how the generated SOAP note components compare to the target SOAP note:\n\n1. Subjective: The generated note does not have an explicit subjective section like the Target SOAP note. However, it provides some context in the introduction and under the \"P\" (Plan) section.\n\n2. Objective: The objective section of the generated note can be found in the VAT Sessions sections, where the patient's performance on specific tasks is documented.\n\n3. Assessment: The assessment section can be found in both the 3rd and 4th sections of the generated note, where the patient's response to user needs assessment and performance during the VAT sessions are evaluated.\n\n4. Plan: The plan is outlined in the final paragraph, detailing homework assignments, metacognitive strategies, and future session plans.\n\nWhile not a traditional SOAP note, the generated note does provide structured documentation of the training session, assesses the patient's performance, and outlines a plan for continued training. However, it deviates significantly from the Target SOAP note in terms of its structure and context (medical vs non-medical).\n\nA score of 5 would reflect a moderate difference between the generated and target SOAP notes, as they share some similarities but do not strictly adhere to the traditional format or context. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: \n </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the response from the language model for this conversation.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 (Week 2) R.T.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK.

And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right.

Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  Speaker: Assistant\nRole: Healthcare Provider\nSource: Medical Documentation\n\nIntroduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare, providing a structured framework for evaluating patient information. This document will detail the components of a SOAP note and its significance in clinical practice.\n\nFunction\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThis section documents the subjective experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient. It provides context for the Assessment and Plan sections. Key components include:\n- Chief Complaint (CC): The patient's reported symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or statement describing why they are presenting.\n- History of Present Illness (HPI): A detailed account of the patient's CC, organized using the OLDCARTS acronym.\n- Medical history: Current or past medical conditions relevant to the case.\n- Surgical history: Important surgeries and their details.\n- Family history: Pertinent family medical history.\n- Social History: Information about the patient's home environment, education, employment, eating habits, activities, drug use, sexuality, and suicide/depression risk.\n- Review of Systems (ROS): A system-based list of questions to uncover symptoms not mentioned by the patient.\n\nObjective\nThis section documents objective data from the patient encounter. It includes:\n- Vital signs: Temperature, pulse, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels.\n- Physical exam findings: Details about the patient's general appearance, specific body systems examination, and any abnormalities found.\n- Laboratory data: Test results related to the case.\n- Imaging results: Results from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or other imaging tests.\n- Other diagnostic data: Any additional test results relevant to the case.\n\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes:\n- Problem list: A prioritized list of problems or diagnoses.\n- Differential Diagnosis: A list of potential diagnoses, ranked by likelihood.\n- Discussion: Explanation of the thought process behind the differential diagnosis.\n\nPlan\nThis section outlines the steps to address the patient's illnesses, including:\n- Testing needed and rationale for each test.\n- Therapy or medications prescribed.\n- Specialist referrals or consultations required.\n- Patient education and counseling needs.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe SOAP note serves as an essential tool in organizing patient information, aiding clinical reasoning, and improving communication between healthcare providers. The note's structure helps ensure that important information is not overlooked and makes it easier for colleagues to understand the case and follow the treatment plan. However, the SOAP note does have limitations, such as its inability to document changes over time, which could be addressed through extensions like the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation). </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  To improve the variable's response and better address the objective function, consider making the following changes:\n1. Include a comprehensive explanation of why the SOAP note format was modified for this non-medical context:\n   - Briefly mention that the SOAP note is used in healthcare settings to document patient symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and progress.\n   - Explain that the generated note uses a similar structure to document progress in a non-medical context (assistive technology training) but with some modifications.\n2. Clearly state the structure of the generated note:\n   - Subjective: The introduction and \"P\" (Plan) section provide some context.\n   - Objective: The VAT Sessions sections document the patient's performance on specific tasks.\n   - Assessment: The 3rd and 4th sections evaluate the patient's response to user needs assessment and performance during the VAT sessions.\n   - Plan: The final paragraph outlines homework assignments, metacognitive strategies, and future session plans.\n3. Mention that the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation) could be used in this non-medical context as well to address the limitations of the SOAP note format:\n   - Explain that the SOAPE model adds an additional \"Evaluation\" section to document changes over time.\n   - Discuss how this extension could be beneficial for tracking the patient's progress and adapting the training program accordingly.\n4. Provide a revised score based on these considerations:\n   - A score of 3 would reflect a significant difference between the generated and target SOAP notes, as they share some similarities but deviate significantly in terms of structure, context, and the inclusion of an evaluation section. This score acknowledges the attempt to use a structured approach for non-medical documentation while also addressing its shortcomings. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation. Specifically, give feedback to the following span of text:\n\n<VARIABLE> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a (...) note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </VARIABLE>\n\nGiven the above history, describe how the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses could be improved to improve the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>. Be very creative, critical, and intelligent.\n\n", "message": "_backward_through_llm prompt"}

Developed by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago, this structure provides a framework for evaluating information, cognitive aid, and potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.\n\nFunction\nThe SOAP note consists of four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThe Subjective section documents the patient's personal views or feelings, interim information, and context for the assessment and plan. It includes Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The HPI begins with a simple opening statement including the patient's age, sex, and reason for the visit.\n\nObjective\nThe Objective section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, other diagnostic data, and recognition of other clinicians' documentation.\n\nAssessment\nThe Assessment section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes the problem list, differential diagnosis, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\nPlan\nThe Plan section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed (medications).\n\nIssues of Concern\nA weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time. To address this gap, extensions to the SOAP model include acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E reminding to assess how well the plan has worked.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe advantage of a SOAP note is organizing relevant information for easy access and quick understanding. It helps clinicians follow the document more efficiently, making it essential for communication between healthcare professionals. However, electronic documentation risks burdening busy clinicians with excessive data, necessitating the need to make the most clinically relevant data easily accessible and immediately available.\n\nConclusion\nThe SOAP note is an essential tool for healthcare providers, ensuring organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation of patient information. Its adoption has simplified communication between healthcare professionals, improving overall care and outcomes. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  Based on the provided target and generated SOAP notes, the score would be approximately 3 out of 10. The target SOAP note is focused on a clinical case study, while the generated SOAP note discusses the SOAP note system itself as a tool for healthcare documentation and communication. The generated SOAP note does not directly match the format or content of the target SOAP note. However, it does provide valuable information about the purpose, structure, and significance of SOAP notes in healthcare, which could be useful context for understanding the target SOAP note's format. To better align with the target SOAP note, a revised version would focus on a specific clinical case study using the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) structure.\n\nRevised SOAP Note:\nTitle: SOAP Notes: Gemini/Alexa Summer Training Session\n\nIntroduction\nThe following is an example of a SOAP note documenting a training session using voice assistive technology (VAT) tools, specifically Alexa and Google Gemini, to gather information on current events. The session focused on topics like Texas Flooding and Biotechnology.\n\nSubjective\nPatient, a 45-year-old female, presented for a 1-hour research session as part of the Gemini/Alexa summer training program. Patient was engaged and eager to participate in the session. The patient has been diagnosed with speech and language challenges, which were observed during the session.\n\nObjective\nDuring the session, the patient engaged with VAT tools (Alexa and Google Gemini) to gather information on topics of interest and current events. The patient's verbal output was often slurred and used filler words (e.g., \"like\", \"um\", \"uh\"), and incomplete sentences; however, her communicative intent was generally clear. She showed some difficulty reading prompts from the powerpoint aloud and occasionally stumbled over words. Despite these challenges, she was able to express a detailed, though disorganized, summary of news content. Visual input was helpful, and the patient expressed that Gemini was easier to understand than Alexa due to its more concise responses and visual output of information.\n\nAssessment\nThe patient demonstrated an ability to use VAT tools for research purposes, with improvements in her ability to construct prompts for seeking information. However, her speech remains disfluent and slurred at times with reduced clarity. The patient benefits from structured models and prompting to improve her creation of prompts for VAT/AI tools.\n\nPlan\nRecommendations include continuing structured practice using AI tools (Alexa and Google Gemini), finishing the creation of a Gemini account, and practicing constructing Prompts for seeking information. Incorporate visuals to support memory and the creation of prompts during sessions to further improve the patient's ability to use VAT/AI tools effectively. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Strengthen the connection between the SOAP note system and its impact on healthcare communication: Instead of simply stating that the SOAP note improves communication between healthcare professionals, provide evidence or examples of how it facilitates this improvement. For instance, describe scenarios where clear and organized documentation led to improved diagnoses or treatment plans.\n2. Focus on the specific benefits of SOAP notes for the target clinical case study: The current response does not directly relate the advantages of the SOAP note system to the Gemini/Alexa summer training session that was being discussed in the SOAP note example. To better connect with the objective function, the language model could expand upon how using the structured SOAP note format helped streamline communication between healthcare professionals involved in the training session, ultimately leading to improved care and outcomes for the patient.\n3. Highlight the importance of accurate and detailed documentation: The current response mentions that the SOAP note ensures \"organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation\" without elaborating on why this is important. To emphasize the significance of this aspect, the language model could discuss how thorough and precise documentation aids in identifying patterns, making diagnoses more accurate, and improving treatment plans.\n4. Address potential challenges or limitations: The response does not acknowledge any potential difficulties that may arise when using the SOAP note system, such as overlooking important information or misinterpreting data due to poorly structured notes. Including a discussion of these issues and suggesting strategies for addressing them can help strengthen the overall quality of the response.\n5. Incorporate a clear call-to-action: The current response concludes by stating that the adoption of SOAP notes has \"simplified communication between healthcare professionals, improving overall care and outcomes.\" To further align with the objective function, the language model could offer specific suggestions for how healthcare providers can effectively implement and utilize the SOAP note system in their practices. This could include tips on writing clear and concise subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, as well as best practices for organizing and storing SOAP notes for easy access and retrieval.\n\nBy making these modifications, the language model's response can provide a more detailed and informative explanation of how the SOAP note system benefits healthcare communication, ultimately improving its alignment with the objective function.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file  Session 2 R.T. (News & Facts) 7-10-2025.m4a    Speaker 1: RT  Speaker 2: Clinician  Speaker 3: Clinician  Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  So I'm just. For my like my like state of mind, summertime is like keep on going.  00:00:13 Speaker 3  Can you all hear me? OK, I want to make sure my Wi-Fi is also stable. I don't know what happened. Has a little glitch. Perfect. I'm going to share the slides here and then R, just double checking. Did you start creating a free Google Gemini account yet?  00:00:37 Speaker 1  I think I did, but I don't think it's. I probably. I don't think I actually finished it, but I'll do it later or something.  00:00:43 Speaker 3  OK. Why don't you go open your browser and then go through Google Gemini so we can get this ready and what we can do is I'm going to go through some content. And you can try to explore some of this information on Google using the Gemini AI and for the rest of you all you are more than welcome to try it together, because one thing we'll learn about assisted technology or AI assisted. Tools for therapy is we all need to learn some basic competency about how to use this so. R, even though we're kind of like teaching you and working with you to help you, we're also learning this ourselves.  00:01:30 Speaker 1  OK.  00:01:31 Speaker 3  If you remember, we learned about news and facts and communication using Alexa last summer. Do you remember? What are some of your popular comments? Like you are doing and using with Alexa on this topic.  00:01:46 Speaker 1  Uh. I was like, you know, I'd say alarm wake up or I put a reminder in like I got PT top of the hour. So it's like I usually it's like another alarm clock.  00:02:00 Speaker 3  Yeah, from what I'm hearing, it seems like you're doing a lot of these for a reminder and scheduling so news and are very different. Let me show you some examples. OK, so these are the things you are curious about, for example. Two weeks ago we did a design session or like R, if you were to go to AI tools and a website that tells you about everything you want to know, what would you like to do? And I believe you worked on something like like research and chemistry like you looked up. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about that?  00:02:40 Speaker 1  And I was trying to. Ask like I think it was Jim and I are like one of them. I was like, can you can you like tell me tell me about like specific instrument in the laboratory like different parts of. I think I think it was like a thermocycler, like a machine that like, makes different temperatures for like PCR machine. It's like temperature for like every action to happen. And if I if I hear the steps one more time before I start like a procedure at my volunteer lab position and through my Alexi, I wake up and hear it before. So when I go over to laugh and say ohh I can remember it so I can do it right there. So it just gives a little review before start of my day.  00:03:33 Speaker 3  Yeah. So it sounds like before you start your day, you wanted to kind of have like a assistant to her. With key things to remember, steps to follow. So this is something AI is really good at. And then like I know those of you who are in the call, if you log on Gemini, you want to take a look at some of these commands. We're going to all explore this together. OK. So some of the things. It could be like what you're saying, like the weather, because you need to get ready to head to work the calendar events, the dates and destinations and new reports, news reports like about what's going on. Out there, these are mostly done previously on your Alexa, so the reason why this summer both you and Michael picked to use Gemini is that's another AI tools that you 2 feel the quality of the content is pretty good. Thing is you can't take this. On Gemini a. On your phone and you can use this outside your home. What I think it's also helpful is you are a pretty heavy Google user. So what you've been doing like your Google Calendar, like looking up information syncing. So I'd like you to play with some of that. OK and. Know that some of these AI tools may not have the most up-to-date information. So when you think about asking the AI you wanted to come up with some. Time sensitive prompts or information, so to speak, so you can ask Lexa. Ask Gemini just the right amount of information so just some ideas so let's maybe try something that oopsie. Let's try to think about one thing you're curious about, OK? What is something you wanted to know? More information. Like you can think about just along the line of, like going to work or other things.  00:05:43 Speaker 1  Maybe like there could be like a current like news event that like wanted to like learn some back information like I just looked the other day. There's like a big like flooding event in Texas. And I was like, I'll check that out but like maybe it's for like. In my like to talk to me about in the morning to update me about like current events.  00:06:06 Speaker 3  Yeah. So there are some current events that may happen like you wish to stay on top of the news and facts and information, right? One is related to weather, but it's also natural disaster and then? In we I know in it didn't really like happen here in California, but few months ago early in the January, we had mountain fires down here in Los Angeles. So we sometimes just love to stay on top of this information and it's critical for not only just staying top of news. Also critical for safety purposes. Let's get clarified.  00:06:47 Speaker 1  You know, safety if there's fire. Like we're going off the freeway up to like, like the the valley up in LA. Like if there's a fire, some of those freeways, like the 210 or something like shut off. There's like, how do I do that?  00:07:04 Speaker 3  Yeah. So we don't know how much information Gemini has. That's up to date. We're going to explore that together, OK. And if you want, we can even compare the answers about the same question on prompt from Alexa and also look at the Gemini AI's response and see how well they perform. So let's stay with that topic about. There is a natural disaster. Flooding happening in Texas. Yes. So knowing that, sorry, I think I went backward. Whoopsie. If we want to know about these pieces of information, how we do this previously was we go online or if you subscribe to like a new source, it could be an app on your phone like there's a news feed. You get notifications sometimes or you watch the TV, or you listen to the radio station on the car. So there's some possible channels you can find those information. So with this type of design and information, you need to think about what you're going to ask so you can think about specific query or like a long question prompt to ask the AI or Alexa. So let's practice. How would you ask Alexa about this specific information? I don't know if you have Alexa on if you want to bring it and then like put it next to your face so we can see. Do you want to try to ask Alexa about this particular event and see what you can get?  00:08:40 Speaker 1  Alright so. Trying to think of. Where are you? What are we? Ask her so. Trying to say like. How I format my question? Alexa. What about the what is happening in Texas and the floods?  00:09:48 Alexa  This morning. 6 fittings after the damage still tough to fathom. They can. It feels hard. I just talked everything in my mind and I say I want. To help while the death toll continues to rise, Braxton Garments High School, confirming the rising sophomore, died in the catastrophic flooding. His sister Felicity still missing while the family of eight-year old Mary Kate Jacoby says she's entered the gates of Heaven, calling her tiny but mighty. And full of love. The recent numbers reported break my heart. And they break the fart. Briefing officials now facing tough questions on why flood warnings from the National Weather Service were communicated more widely. This incident will be reviewed. You have my word records from a Kern County meeting in 2016 showing former commissioner said the flood warning. Mr. was pretty antiquated, calling it marginal at the best. What's the biggest reason that these systems have not gone into place? At this point, you know. And UM. I was in an office during those discussions, and frankly, I'm more focused on the future in the past. Meanwhile, the grim search for the missing entering another tough day. It's a hostile environment, is what we call it. Everything is moved and shifted, disaster specialist Larry Minor and his team, including horses and search dogs. Working round the clock determined to provide greeted families some kind of resolution. Stay until we get it done and we want them back up here. And those search. Crews tell me their work is really just beginning as they navigate these remote stretches of the Guadalupe River. In the meantime, city leaders here in Carville, Tammy, they are heartened by these special session called for by Texas Governor Greg Abbott. I'm on some of some of the key topics that are planning to be discussed. The emergency communication systems, those warning sirens that could go off whenever rivers. River levels rise during a flash flood as well as much needed relief funding for this entire area. All right, Morgan, thank you. And a reminder, if you're looking for ways to support the flood victims in Texas, you can find them on our website, today.com.    00:12:13 Speaker 3  So, R, since we can't see your screen and it seems like you watched a little video. Oh, you're pausing, Alexa? Yeah.  00:12:27 Speaker 1  She is what she gave me a little video update like like like Natural Disaster over in Texas. And it was like, good to be up to date on that information. It was someone. You know, ask me about my opinion or brings it up. I have some more back info because I just asked her. About it, yeah.  00:12:47 Speaker 3  It's great. So can you quickly summarize what the news information tell you and if you were to maybe like share this again back to Michael because he may be interested in what news and facts you explored, how would you quickly summarize what was going on so he can?Also look up. On his system.  00:13:11 Speaker 1  I just learned that. In like I remember this, one of the counties over in Texas, that massive flooding from the out of the Guadalupe River and all these. Residents were looking for the families and a lot of people disappeared and people were on horses and like surveillance dogs in the whole region like. Like a really a lot of people are devastated. That's why I learned about.  00:13:44 Speaker 3  That's a great summary. R, would you be interested in seeing what a web-based AI tool is sharing and showing about the similar events and information? I asked Lori to kindly prepare something for us on her and Gemini. So I'm going to stop share and let her show you. Some of the responses before. There is the prompt, so if you see the text box here, you'll probably remember the layout of these type of light. This is where she entered. Tell me about the flooding events in Texas.  00:14:18 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, OK, so R. Look at all this text. Wow. There is a lot of information to take in and it's a little bit different than hearing it on Alexa. The visual signal is a little bit different, right? And I noticed that Doctor do asked you if you could summarize and one thing that I wanted to teach you or point out that what we could do with this big amount of this large amount of text is. Summarized right. So we're getting a lot of information. So maybe we can say. Please summarize. What do you think, R? Three key points, or one paragraph or what would be easiest for you? Do you think?  00:15:15 Speaker 1  Like 3 key points because I like bullet points, so point, yeah.  00:15:18 Speaker 2  Yeah, me too. Yeah, you're a scientist. Love those bullet points, right? Please summarize in three key so key facts, R.    00:15:31 Speaker 1  Yeah, packs. Yeah.  00:15:32 Speaker 2  3 facts with bullet points, right. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's see what we get. So we got this large amount of tax, large amount of information.   00:15:48 Speaker 1  A lot.  00:15:54 Speaker 2  We just modified our prompt. OK, so let's see what we've got here. What do you think? It's still pretty.   00:16:03 Speaker 1  It's. Large, but it's it's more condensed.  Speaker 2  So you think so one week. So do you want to have? Well, let's do you want to like maybe summarize a little bit more?  00:16:14 Speaker 1  Yes, we can ask her for summarized version of this.  00:16:18 Speaker 2  Summarize, summarize each bullet in what do you think one or two sentences?   Speaker 1  Yeah,   Speaker2:  One or two?  Speaker 1:   One  Speaker 2  OK. Let's see what we. Get.  00:16:39 Speaker 2  Well, not bad. What do you think?  00:16:43 Speaker 1  Yeah. That's why it's distinct. I like when it's better to straight to the point like that so.  00:16:48 Speaker 2  OK. Should we ask for more? Like more, you know, more condensed condensation condensed sentences.  00:16:57 Speaker 1  Well, I think it's a good amount for me, but maybe other more small, but I think it's.  00:17:00 Speaker 2  OK. Good.  00:17:02 Speaker 1  Good for me.  00:17:04 Speaker 2  OK what I noticed. Also R is that. The the key facts seem to be bolded.  00:17:13 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:17:13 Speaker 2  Just kind of helpful, I think interesting, yeah. Yeah, because we didn't ask Gemini to do that, but.  00:17:21 Speaker 1  Did that so it's like helpful that way like think it's important, but like she just emphasized it.  00:17:32 Speaker 2  Yeah, I think I think that made it easier to for the information to be scanned visually.  00:17:38 Speaker 1  Yeah, you just see it like that. First one's like people missing like. You think what happened?  00:17:50 Speaker 2  Now, how would you compare that to what you heard on Alexa?  00:17:56 Speaker 1  And I see it visually only a couple bullet points like that it's more. I'm a visual learner so I see it like that it's more. Easy for me to process and like she just says a long paragraph at me. I'm just like what?  00:18:17 Speaker 2  Yeah, good point. Some people are visual learners and some people are auditory learners. Probably, right?  00:18:24 Speaker 1  I'm visual.  00:18:30 Speaker 3  So with this content, R can you? Practice summarizing this key event about the flooding in Texas. Like try not to read the whole text verbatim. You did such a summarizing from the video, which is a a media form and now we're giving you just the plain writing and actually added more details like how many people actually. Which I didn't hear you mentioned that in the previous version of. The quick new. Do you want to retell the key event one more time with some detailed information?  00:19:12 Speaker 1  Alright so. Recently there was a devastating flash flood in Hill Country in Texas and almost like one in 120 people. That are missing and then this historic girls camp has been like. There's a lot of missing campers and. Some of those, like the staff there is not here anymore and a lot of people think this is. Like this? Major flooding could be like low damage in local waterways, so it was really. Like. I'm trying over next to you really. They're really deadly for all these different people in the area and could have been for the ecosystem too, so. It was. A tragedy.  00:20:25 Speaker 3  That's a great summary, R. What? I'm going to ask Laurie to do now is have her copy this three bullet text in the chat box so that you can go to, like, maybe open up a Word document. And then, like, read, massage, reward some of these when we go back to the main room. After we're done with this section of the learning, I'd like you to report back to Michael and tell him. Well, I had some news prepared for you. Here's my news report for today, OK. So that's a hallmark based on what you remember from the video because you saw a lot of like dialogue and then like the lived experiences from the people being interviewed on news and then like a quick summary, these are two different types of information and we're exposed to both types of information all the time to. Remember these key events. So Lori, if you can stop screen share and then drop that in the chat, we'll have you spend some time working on that for a few minutes before we go on to the next one. OK, R, you got the text from.  00:21:49 Speaker 1  I I copied it so you put it on a little Word document again. If you do it again.  00:21:57 Speaker 3  And L, please save this and then we'll put it in a soap note document. Maybe I can open that up real quick. Let me do that as we're speaking. OK, I'm just going to drop this to my clinicians as a private message. This is the soap note document for today. We can add. And here we go. OK. So while R is working on her quick homework assignment. For the clinicians. If you wanted to like again get on Google Gemini, create a quick account if you want to show a demo, we'll use your demo for the next round of questions, OK. OK.So next I wanted to share. I'm trying to find my thing. OK, we talked about news. OK. Can you all see my my screen with this blue color? Yeah, so. Perfect. So one thing about information seeking is we want to know like under what contacts people tend to like, ask these questions whether it's Alexa, these personal assistants or voice assistants or go online, go to Internet or ask your caregivers. Doctors there are a lot of things we can ask for. It could be medically related to your appointment, your therapy, knowing how much exercise you need to work on. So I'd like you to think about the next prompt or thought bubble or thinking ideas you can brainstorm. And this time I want you to try and asking our AI tool what are something around you that you're interested in learning. This could be like. The people in the community, or it could be the geographic location in southern. Yeah. Or it could be like temporal time related, like what's happening in the summer. You mentioned, it feels like summer is really coming there, probably interesting events. I want you to think about a couple of these and what we're going to do is the same business as usual. Some of these prompts you can ask Alexa because Alexa has your like location because it's location based, things you ask Alexa could be can you provide me with some latest or local or international news? This is probably something you're getting from your daily flash debriefing. I know you have that in place. Maybe we can ask Alexa and then we'll try the same with the Gemini to see if we're getting different type of news and feed recommendation. The reason why I want to show you this is you're not asking a specific factual. A specific fact related events like so specific it's about the flood in Texas. Sometimes when you ask for information you want to ask just open-ended questions like just tell me general stuff happening. The like this is more like talking about the science because I know you love this. The algorithm behind these like AI tools or assistive technology or conversational agent is that it has a recommendation system behind it. It learns from your questions, it learns from these preferences and gave you recommendations. You might be interested. So because your device, your Alexa knows you very well, I'm curious to learn how is it going to recommend you stuff locally versus Gemini, which you're probably not super familiar with. And it also is not very. Knowledgeable about your preferences. So we're going to try this out and then we'll wrap up and conclude. Can you potentially maybe hold Alexa or make it more visible and ask this voice command on the right side so we can see what Alexa is telling us about your local news or events? So you just read this off from the screen, OK.  00:26:53 Speaker 1  Ok. Can you provide me with the latest local news?  00:27:02 Speaker 3  Did you say Alexa?   00:27:07 Speaker 1  Alexa, can you provide me with the low, low, latest local and international news?  00:27:27 Speaker 3  Did they recognize you? Let me see if I can paint your screen.  00:27:36 Alexa  Racing District telling us that that tunnel has one way in and one way out. So Lindsey had those workers not been able to scramble over that degree field. This could have been an entirely different scenario. Imagine so. Alright, Kane Whitworth, Phil. Thanks to. You as always. It's been nearly one week since that tragic flooding cave in Texas, and tonight the exhausting search for the missing continues. Now President Trump is set to visit Texas Hill Country, and the growing questions about plans to cut FEMA and leader concerns about just how long it took for officials to issue their warnings. Several has the concerning timeline and the latest from Hill. I'm sorry. Hey, Trevor. Well, Lindsey, we just got an update from officials moments ago that the number of people missing here in Hill Country in Texas has dropped from 172 down to 166. It's not much of movement, but it is the first real movement that we have seen in about 48 hours. It is a massive search effort that's required with thousands of people here on the ground and combing through. The ravaged river banks of the Guadalupe River, and we are a long way from the end of the. Tonight the agonizing search efforts in the Texas Hill Country officials say there's 166 people still missing, the number barely budging in 48 hours. This is the kind of terrain that the search crews are dealing with and flipped over vehicle. All this debris that's piled up high. We have a rescue crew right here. They've got a dog with them.  00:29:01 Speaker 3  I'm going to ask you to tell Alexa to stop.  00:29:05 Speaker 1  Stop. Alexa, stop.  00:29:07 Speaker 3  That's correct. There we go. Good job. So here's my question. Do you feel Alexa registered or heard? What's your command earlier or it was just playing the video that you had it on? Alexa.  00:29:24 Speaker 1  I think when I when I said I. International events, I think you just went straight to like the national news. Yeah, no, like, maybe because I maybe originally asked about it. Maybe it just kind of cued off that.  00:29:42 Speaker 3  Yeah, you also stumbled upon the actual command. As you were saying it. I did notice it had a few words that a little bit hurt, like latest local or international news.  00:29:55 Speaker 1  Yeah, that was a stumble.  00:29:57 Speaker 3  Yeah, let's try that one more time and ask Alexa, OK, you may want to pick one because it's hard to get both local and international news and think about how you want to say this. So Alexa can truly get the specific information you need it. And don't forget to add your keyword like Alexa. OK.  00:30:15 Speaker 1  Yeah, her.  00:30:17 Speaker 3  There was a lot of learning. Remember this summer is training Level 2, so we're like expecting you to do a lot more at the same time and you're doing OK, you're holding up and you're keeping, you're keeping up with your good work. Yeah, let's try that one more time.  00:30:36 Speaker 1  Alexa. Can you provide me with the local? Alexa, can you provide me with the latest local news?  00:30:54 Alexa  Available on Apple TV, Android TV, Android, Smart TV, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire tablet, Roku TV, Samsung Smart TV.  00:31:08 Speaker 1  Stop. Alexa, stop.  00:31:12 Speaker 3  OK.  00:31:13 Speaker 1  Just gave me like all these things you can stream it on this you can get it on that new source.  00:31:19 Speaker 3  So that means this doesn't work. How can we modify this if we're not here training you? You're like asking for local news on your own at home. How would you modify this voice command to be something more specific?  00:31:36 Speaker 1  I'll say her name. Can you provide me with the latest Orange County News or something like or or to where I am? Yeah.  00:31:47 Speaker 3  That's very good. You had you had a very specific location, even though, like, I'm giving you ideas. This is general local, but the Alexa needs to actually know what is local referring to, right. Yeah, that was a good catch. Anything else you think you can help add to this command to make it more specific?  00:32:13 Speaker 1  I may need to give a topic to that news like. You can ask can you provide me the latest? Local biotechnology news or. Local local weather or like, are you going to ask her a date like you know? And I'll come into that like, you know, I asked her what the date that the US open of surfing or something like that, just that would be a specific question. Types when a broad term like, what are some? Like free events this summer at the beach or something like.  00:32:55 Speaker 3  Yeah.  That's a lot of good ideas, R. I think you can probably save them for homework and work on those between. I love the idea about local news related to like biomedical. I think such a great topic that's specific related to news. I know there are some good companies in Orange County and stuff you're interested with that.  00:33:16 Speaker 1  Yeah. And like Irvine, like, you know, this big, big name and it's like Edwards life Sciences, they got a new location here in Irvine testing area. It's like big deal for me.  00:33:33 Speaker 3  That's me. So why don't you take a few minutes to come up with a command you can probably type it. I'm happy to swap it and update the slide real quick so you can read it in visually easy way for you, but let's update the command so you can get new. Information and whatever you put in the chat, I'm going to ask Lori to help us. She's going to put in Gemini and then get a a generated commands and response and we can see what happens, OK. So tell me how you want to change or adapt this Alexa command. We just. Sorry still go to the screen share. But allow me to type on it. In a few minutes, so swap my screen. OK, there we go. OK, so we have this. What would you like me to actually? Say or use for this particular command. Or update on this command.  00:34:40 Speaker 1  Her name? Can you provide me with? Local. Biotechnology news in Orange County.  00:34:55 Speaker 3  Great.  00:34:56 Speaker 1  See what happens.  00:34:58 Speaker 3  Let's reshare this. OK. Can you see the screen OK.  00:35:07 Speaker 1  Yes.  00:35:08 Speaker 3  Wait, OK, let's try. Remember, you got to wake her up, and then we're going to ask this specific question to Alexa. And then once you have it, just do the same, hold it up, and then we. Can see what's on. The screen something well, like nice and good, but we'll give it a. try  00:35:19 Speaker 1  Alright. OK. Alexa. Can you provide me with the with local biotechnology news in Orange County?  00:35:36 Alexa  Here's your name. In northern ducks. After days of promising a home run, it seems the Ducks have barely pulled off an RBI single.  00:35:59 Speaker 1  I might switch right over to like Sports News, so I don't think it moved down. Understand me.  00:36:05 Speaker 3  Oh. I didn't give you what you wanted. Ohh, I'm sorry.  00:36:10 Speaker 1  Went to Anaheim Ducks of all things.  00:36:14 Speaker 3  OK.So it caught the Orange County keywords, but not the bio.  00:36:21 Speaker 1  Bio-technology About analogy could just be like. That's not a term that most like let's say users say like that. So but. Cool. Like I don't know.  00:36:32 Speaker 3  I did notice you also this is the second time you ended up like stumbling upon that word again. So we'll probably do a few like just over articulation practices. So you were comfortable. Word.  00:36:46 Speaker 1  Coming out. Yeah. It's one of my goals in speech therapy, just, like, make it more. Understandable for other people, it's not my most.  00:36:56 Speaker 3  I'm glad I caught a very difficult long word with like multi syllables. So what I'm going to do is let Lori try to show something from Geminiand see if we can have something good.  00:37:09 Speaker 1  OK.  00:37:10 Speaker 3  Satisfactory. That's why we're using multiple AI's, right?  00:37:13 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:37:14 Speaker 3  Lori. And feel free to screen share.  00:38:05 Speaker 2  Give me a second, OK?  00:38:07 Speaker 3  Take your time.  00:38:07 Speaker 2  Here there we go.  00:38:10 Speaker 3  I think I saw your tab. It's like right next to your soap notes tab.  00:38:18 Speaker 2  Here we go. All right. I just typed in the prompt. Can you provide me with local biotechnology news in Orange County? Did I get it right, R?  00:38:30 Speaker 1  She did all right. You can't.  00:38:31 Speaker 2  Here we go. Let's see what we got. Right. We got a lot of very detailed information. Let's see, let me scroll for you. Key developments you see, Irvine? Industry growth check. So in a way, we've got a little too much information, don't.  00:39:04 Speaker 1  Yeah, it's a lot, but like basically bullet points is like I like.  00:39:06 Speaker 2  Is there any? You want bullet points, or do you want to constrain the content at all?  00:39:14 Speaker 1  Both contain the content first.  00:39:16 Speaker 2  OK. OK, So what content do you want? Would you be more interested in like industry content?  00:39:26 Speaker 1  UM. Industry, yeah.  00:39:31 Speaker 2  OK, please. So now we're going to modify that prompt. Please give me industry. Content. On this topic, right. We don't have to say please by the way, but it's kind of nice. OK. All right. OK, now we're getting a little bit more specific. But what's interesting is that now we've got more content.  00:40:12 Speaker 1  Yeah, I just looked down like the paragraph. I heard that I looked at Terminal Edwards, life Sciences. That's a big name in biotech.   00:40:22 Speaker 2  That. An interesting topic too. Should we, should we ask for information about Edwards?  00:40:27 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:40:33 Speaker 2  About Edwards biotech, right.  00:40:36 Speaker 1  Average life Sciences is a.  00:40:37 Speaker 2  Oh, sorry. Life sciences, OK? Why am I not spelling sciences? OK, here we go. All right, so now it almost it lost. It seemed to lose the information about the idea of latest news, and now it's kind of giving us like a core dump. How would we, how would we get back to the latest information, do you think? So we have this was the original prompt. What could we do? How could we modify original prompt?  00:41:32 Speaker 1  Current information about you to like maybe early in this year would be all right, but like 2025?  00:41:34 Speaker 2  There you go. I I like that idea. 02020 Oh, it's even more constrained. OK, let's give 2025 news. How about that? Or should we say news information?  00:41:52 Speaker 1  Some news because like. But but just happened to Edwards.  00:41:58 Speaker 2  OK. I'm just going to copy paste here. And now I'm interested to see what we get. OK. Well, it's giving U.S. financial information, which you probably don't need, right?  00:42:26 Speaker 1  Like you know, I just want, like, actual news that the companies doing current inventions or processes say something if they make the new procedure, that other I was going to pick up like that, they have their name on it, it's gonna be patent. Patent. So if they do that, it's going to be.  00:42:45 Speaker 2  So can you revise that prompt with me? Let's say only. Give me what?  00:43:02 Speaker 1  New Edwards sciences. Procedures. Procedures see what happened.  00:43:10 Speaker 2  Procedures. OK, only give me information. On new. 20 on new procedures.  00:43:23 Speaker 1  Yeah. Do it there.  00:43:37 Speaker 2  OK, so that helped a little bit, huh? Transcatheter aortic valve replacement?  00:43:40 Speaker 1  Yeah. Yeah, they're like, you know, in your heart, you got these valves and they're making new ones.  00:43:48 Speaker 2  Cool. OK. What I like here or what's interesting is. They give us what's new and then significance, right?  00:43:58 Speaker 1  Yeah, it was. They they got this new thing, but it was going to do this. That's right. It's important. Yeah. Like learning about stuff like that.  00:44:08 Speaker 2  So is there anything that you want to do to make this even more condensed? Here's the prompt. We have only give me information on your procedures, so we did get. We did get the information we wanted, but do you want to ask for bullet points this time? Like one sentence bullet points.  00:44:34 Speaker 1  Yeah, one cents bullet points it condense it more because straight to the fact points.  00:44:41 Speaker 2  OK, so why don't you give me the prompt? This is what we had before.  00:44:53 Speaker 1  Yeah. Uhm. And then remember, Genesis or whatever her name.  00:45:07 Speaker 2  When you said you said condense.  00:45:10 Speaker 1  I like condensed information about the. Is. 2025 new procedures.  00:45:19 Speaker 2  OK, I think you I think I could just say condense to one bullet .1 sentence. Bullet points, OK.  00:45:27 Speaker 1  3/20.  00:45:27 Speaker 2  See what we get. I don't think we need to do. This. But I'm just going to put this in. For. For learning. Condense this information. To one sentence, bullet points, let's see what we get. Well. What do you think? Do we lose? Do we lose anything valuable or are you happy with what we've got here?  00:46:09 Speaker 1  I can. I'm happy with it, but like most like I know this area like these terms you're using, but if someone has more of a. Like a lay person's perspective about like what Edwards is doing, we kind of. A lot of detail, so you can go right over the head, but maybe if I'm asking about. I'm really directed into this field, but I wanted to have a casual. Background into I want to learn about it, but it kind of be a lot, so I'll be like too much.  00:46:48 Speaker 2  So do you think that if you wanted to get that more scientific detail that you could or?  00:46:59 Speaker 2  Do you think you could figure out how to? Do that.  00:47:03 Speaker 1  Yeah, I could. Just ask for that. Make make my command specific about. The topic I would like to learn more about, yeah.  00:47:24 Speaker 2  So Doctor do do we have more time or? Should we wrap? That.  00:47:29 Speaker 3  I'm looking at the slides. I don't think we have time for another one, but R, are you to maybe share one or two pieces of news or information? You looked up this session to the rest of the team and as well as M.  00:47:47 Speaker 1  Uhm, I just uhm. Looked at some. New updates and like this company, Edwards, Life Science doing some. New procedures for like. Monitoring the heart valve transplants and like that's, I feel that I like to look into because. My. Background is in life sciences, so you know they're in the area. So where I live, it's like it's good for me to be up to date on my field. Yeah.  00:48:25 Speaker 3  That's great. So between now and next time, which is a new topic that we're going to to introduce to you, you can use these AI tools to get this up to date information. You get it in a very easy to read and process format rather than links and pages, which may seem very overwhelming. For you.  00:48:46 Speaker 1  Yeah. It's like too much.  00:48:49 Speaker 3  And then the Alexa sometimes won't give you the proper information. So this is just another tool to help you, kind of like supplement. There's that gap in whatever you are doing and you can use this either on the phone as a mobile app or on the web page. So a quick homework for you. Set up your Gemini account, explore some of the things related to like news and facts like. Since you love this company, use the AI to do some to do some research and how they are hyperlinks, because sometimes a makes up stuff. So maybe like look up their website to see if these key informations are accurate. OK, so next week, before we start our session, we're going to ask you, hey, tell us about this Edwards Biotech company because none of us know anything about it. You're going. To be the expert.  00:49:38 Speaker 1  Right.  00:49:39 Speaker 3  Great. I'm going to ask everyone to get ready to be back to the main room. R, you want to practice? Just like your little blurb about the flood event, the flooding event, the disaster in Texas. You got my little notes. OK, I will get ready to have. People come back OK.        , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  In this response, I will summarize and format the provided content on SOAP notes following the structure and style described in the rubric:\n\nTitle: SOAP Notes: An Essential Tool for Healthcare Documentation and Communication\n\nIntroduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note is a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. Developed by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago, this structure provides a framework for evaluating information, cognitive aid, and potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.\n\nFunction\nThe SOAP note consists of four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThe Subjective section documents the patient's personal views or feelings, interim information, and context for the assessment and plan. It includes Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The HPI begins with a simple opening statement including the patient's age, sex, and reason for the visit.\n\nObjective\nThe Objective section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, other diagnostic data, and recognition of other clinicians' documentation.\n\nAssessment\nThe Assessment section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes the problem list, differential diagnosis, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\nPlan\nThe Plan section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed (medications).\n\nIssues of Concern\nA weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time. To address this gap, extensions to the SOAP model include acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E reminding to assess how well the plan has worked.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe advantage of a SOAP note is organizing relevant information for easy access and quick understanding. It helps clinicians follow the document more efficiently, making it essential for communication between healthcare professionals. However, electronic documentation risks burdening busy clinicians with excessive data, necessitating the need to make the most clinically relevant data easily accessible and immediately available.\n\nConclusion\nThe SOAP note is an essential tool for healthcare providers, ensuring organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation of patient information. Its adoption has simplified communication between healthcare professionals, improving overall care and outcomes. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  To improve the response from the language model and better align with the objective function, the following modifications can be suggested:\n\n1. Strengthen the connection between the SOAP note system and its impact on healthcare communication: Instead of simply stating that the SOAP note improves communication between healthcare professionals, provide evidence or examples of how it facilitates this improvement. For instance, describe scenarios where clear and organized documentation led to improved diagnoses or treatment plans.\n2. Focus on the specific benefits of SOAP notes for the target clinical case study: The current response does not directly relate the advantages of the SOAP note system to the Gemini/Alexa summer training session that was being discussed in the SOAP note example. To better connect with the objective function, the language model could expand upon how using the structured SOAP note format helped streamline communication between healthcare professionals involved in the training session, ultimately leading to improved care and outcomes for the patient.\n3. Highlight the importance of accurate and detailed documentation: The current response mentions that the SOAP note ensures \"organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation\" without elaborating on why this is important. To emphasize the significance of this aspect, the language model could discuss how thorough and precise documentation aids in identifying patterns, making diagnoses more accurate, and improving treatment plans.\n4. Address potential challenges or limitations: The response does not acknowledge any potential difficulties that may arise when using the SOAP note system, such as overlooking important information or misinterpreting data due to poorly structured notes. Including a discussion of these issues and suggesting strategies for addressing them can help strengthen the overall quality of the response.\n5. Incorporate a clear call-to-action: The current response concludes by stating that the adoption of SOAP notes has \"simplified communication between healthcare professionals, improving overall care and outcomes.\" To further align with the objective function, the language model could offer specific suggestions for how healthcare providers can effectively implement and utilize the SOAP note system in their practices. This could include tips on writing clear and concise subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, as well as best practices for organizing and storing SOAP notes for easy access and retrieval.\n\nBy making these modifications, the language model's response can provide a more detailed and informative explanation of how the SOAP note system benefits healthcare communication, ultimately improving its alignment with the objective function. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Participant was accompanied by caregiver (mother). Session led by Priyal, and observed by two other lab members. Caregiver reported that since the previous session, she utilized Gemini live while at the beach, and Gemini live feature captured a picture and added a social component, asking if they are having fun. Participant and caregiver were engaged throughout the session, participant appeared to exhibit some fatigue at the conclusion of the session during recap discussion with another participant.

For location specific information, Alexa was best.  Participant reported that Gemini , and my glasses to Alexa - my glasses were easy to talk and Alexa gives good conversation and so does gemini , If you wanted to find an address to a particular store, which would you use- participant stated gemini   P: If glasses are on and trying to find location specific information, use your phone or iPad with Alexa app, prompt glasses to open Alexa app and input commands, Gemini was concise.     \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT>  It appears you have provided a detailed explanation of the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\nThe SOAP note is a structured method of documenting patient encounters that helps healthcare workers assess, diagnose, and treat patients effectively. It consists of four sections: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n1. **Subjective**: This section contains the patient's subjective experiences, personal views, or feelings about their condition. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI), which provides context for the assessment and plan.\n\n2. **Objective**: This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. **Assessment**: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, lists the problem, differential diagnoses, and discusses the plan for each problem.\n\n4. **Plan**: This section details the need for additional testing, specialist referrals, patient education, counseling, and any therapy needed (medications).\n\nThe SOAP note helps improve communication among healthcare professionals and ensures a comprehensive and efficient assessment and treatment plan for patients. However, it does have some limitations, such as the inability to document changes over time effectively. Extensions to the SOAP model, like SOAPE, have been proposed to address this gap.\n\nIn the provided conversation, the subjective information includes the patient's chief complaint (chest pain) and history of present illness (describing the chest pain). The objective information might include findings from a physical exam or laboratory tests. The assessment could involve considering potential causes for the chest pain based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, and the plan might involve ordering further tests or prescribing medication. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  Based on your description, the generated SOAP note is not a direct match with the target SOAP note. However, it seems that you have transformed the conversation between the AI and the user into a SOAP note format for educational purposes, which is an interesting and creative approach!\n\nThe main differences between the two SOAP notes lie in their focus and context. The target SOAP note focuses on self-care needs, while the generated SOAP note simulates a clinical encounter regarding chest pain. In terms of structure, the generated SOAP note follows the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) format, while the target SOAP note discusses self-care tools such as Alexa, Gemini, and Meta Glasses for different scenarios.\n\nTo quantify the differences between the two SOAP notes, I would assign a score of 7 out of 10, considering that they are focused on distinct topics and follow different formats despite sharing the same structure. If we were to compare them based solely on their adherence to the SOAP note format, the score would be lower (4 out of 10), since the target SOAP note is more specific to self-care needs. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file  Session 4 M.A. (Self care) 7-17-2025.m4a    Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  And then. Yeah, yeah. I just start to record.  Thank you. Thank you.  All right. So all right, M, let's get started. Tell me, how was your time at the beach? What did you do?  00:00:15 Speaker 2  That's fun.  00:00:17 Speaker 3  What did you? Just.  00:00:19 Speaker 2  No, me and my. Mom just went for a little while.  00:00:22 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:00:23 Speaker 2  We took our dog Roxy.  00:00:25 Speaker 4  OK.  00:00:27 Speaker 2  We didn't take her dog off, she but.  We should have.  00:00:32 Speaker 1  Yeah. Did you hear more dogs there on the beach?  00:00:36 Speaker 2  Yeah, there are a lot of dogs on the beach.  00:00:39 Speaker 1  OK. M, do you hope your parents take? Care of the dog.   00:00:47 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:00:47 Speaker 1  Do you do anything for him or her?  00:00:50 Speaker 2  For her.  00:00:52 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:00:53 Speaker 2  I do.  00:00:54 Speaker 1  Oh, OK. And what kind of things? Do you do?  00:00:58 Speaker 2  Nothing much.  00:01:00  All right.  00:01:00 Speaker 3  What do you do for Roxy when she growls at the door? Do you do anything? No. Do you ignore? Her. Or do you?  00:01:08 Speaker 2  Yeah, just in there.  00:01:09 Speaker 3  Let her outside. M, do you let her? Outside.  00:01:14 Speaker 2  Outside.  00:01:16 Speaker 3  OK. Is she? And when do you?  Let her in. Yep.  00:01:20 Speaker 1  OK. OK, that's good. Is there anything else that you that that you like to do like some kind of care that you like to provide for your dog and help help Mom and Dad with it?  00:01:34 Speaker 2  I like to fill up a bowl of water.  00:01:37 Speaker 1  OK, alright, that's great. How often do you have to do that?  00:01:43 Speaker 2  Once a day.  00:01:45 Speaker 3  OK.  00:01:49 Speaker 1  All right, I'm going to share my screen and today we are going to talk about self-care and medical needs. The the reason I was asking questions about Roxy, I did not know you had a dog. And then also if there are things that. That would help you ask. I mean, if you wanted to ask Gemini about caring for your dog, you know and and helping helping Mom and Dad with it or something that you could do that would be very nice. What do you think?  00:02:18 Speaker 2  Would be.  00:02:20 Speaker 1  Yeah. Would that be useful to you?  OK, alright, let's get started and see. What we can, what kind of? Questions we can ask and what kind of commands we can. Share. Right.  OK. Can you see my?  00:02:36 Speaker 3  Screen. Yes, we can. OK.  00:02:39 Speaker 1  All right, so. Self-care and M needs. I think you're pretty familiar with that from last year and we talked about medication management, searching for laundry and self-care, tips, tips to improve physical and mental health. And searching for some home remedies, if you if you had some health. Problems and searching for a nearby doctor. So with Alexa we were able to do many of these, but we're going to see how different those two are going to be like if you were to ask Alexa and if you were to ask Gemini. So what we could do, do you have your? Alexa anywhere.  00:03:25 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's behind.  00:03:26 Speaker 1  Yeah. Ohh OK. So it's still it's on, right?  00:03:26 Speaker 2  Us.  00:03:29 Speaker 1  It will still give. You information if you had, if you had to use. What?  00:03:33 Speaker 3  Yes it is.  00:03:35 Speaker 1  All right. And do do you happen to have it on your phone at all? I mean, you can use that too. If you wanted to practice, actually it's.  00:03:43 Speaker 3  It is on M's phone, but his phone is having an issue, but it's on the iPad and I.  00:03:47 Speaker 1  Have the iPad right. OK. Yeah, that's good, too. So I I wanted to for some of those commands. Where?  We're looking for location specific details or a time specific details where you are you know. I think you know setting up a reminder or like an event, then we want to see and use Alexa as well like to see what the difference is, we're going to see if that makes any difference and which one is better, OK. Alright, OK, let's see. Right. Uh, let's see. So some help managing medications.  We did this with Alexa last year, M. It's about creating a medication list and then showing your medication list. So let's see if it will let you create a medication list on your on Gemini first. We know that Alexa does it pretty well, but let's start with Gemini and this one.  And and see how how that goes.  00:04:53  Thanks.  00:04:53 Speaker 1  So.  00:04:54 Speaker 3  Is the Gemini live or just Gemini?  00:04:59 Speaker 1  It's up to you. I I think you said in the e-mail that the live worked when and then he could use it with his voice, right? Yeah.  00:05:08 Speaker 3  Yes. Where when you use the regular Gemini, you have to touch your microphone and then you have to find the spot to turn it off the stop.  00:05:17 Speaker 1  Turn it off where is.  00:05:19 Speaker 3  His life. Right. You don't have to do that. It's your voice. And then you just touch the screen.  00:05:24 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK. Yeah, sure. So for sure. Yeah, let's do it live. If it because that that way he can be more independent with, you know, working on those commands.  00:05:35 Speaker 3  You're just gonna use my phone, M to experiment.  00:05:36 Speaker 2  OK.  00:05:41 Speaker 5  OK, I'm ready when you are. What would you like me to do?  00:05:44 Speaker 2  Making medications for me.  00:05:48 Speaker 5  So I can't use reminders yet when we.  Are live for. Now going live is great for things like chatting, finding answers, or brainstorming new ideas.  00:05:57 Speaker 3  Did you hear? That.  00:05:58 Speaker 1  So what did it say? Uh, it cannot use it. It cannot.  00:06:01 Speaker 3  It cannot make a medication list going live yet it's great for getting what was the other thing it said notification and.  00:06:09 Speaker 2  Notification.  00:06:13 Speaker 3  Reminder and remind no, it wasn't reminders. I should have had.  00:06:18 Speaker 1  It OK, I have it in the chat in. Case do you do you want to just?  Try it on Alexa maybe.  00:06:27 Speaker 3  OK. Or I can go to the. Other one and also.  00:06:30 Speaker 5  Control other apps yet when?  00:06:31 Speaker 1  We are live. Let's let's try. Let's try Alexa, because I think that's as effective when it comes to making lists. And you know, creating lists and showing those or reading those lists stuff. So. So let's just practice that those kind of. You know, commands on on there, whichever, because I feel like whichever he can do on his own independently, those we can, you know, test on Gemini. But others like I think maybe we can we can try Alexa.  00:07:03 Speaker 3  OK. Yeah. To talk to. You're going to use A to make a list medication.  00:07:11 Speaker 4  List no, no.  00:07:13 Speaker 2  Open the Alexa app.  00:07:16 Speaker 3  Huh.  00:07:17 Speaker 4  OK, go ahead.  00:07:21 Speaker 3  It's open. Just make your list M.  It's open.  00:07:31 Speaker 2  Hey, Alexa.  00:07:37 Speaker 4  Go ahead.  00:07:41 Speaker 3  Make a medication.  00:07:42 Speaker 2  Make a medication list.  00:07:50 Speaker 3  No. Try again, M.  00:07:52 Speaker 2  Yeah, let's make a medication list.  00:07:59 Speaker 3  It could be using your device.  00:08:04 Speaker 2  Yeah, let's make a medication list. Sermon.  00:08:13 Speaker 3  Let me just put it over here.  00:08:18 Speaker 1  OK. M, have you tried making medication lists on with your with your glasses at all?  00:08:26 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:08:28 Speaker 1  OK. And does how how is? That and does that help you more? Yeah. OK. You can try that too, either 1 whichever 1 you prefer. If you prefer Alexa, we can try on that. Or we can try it on on your on your glasses.  00:08:46 Speaker 2  OK.  00:08:47 Speaker 3  Try.  00:08:48 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, make a medication this.  00:08:55 Speaker 3  You know what, M? You'll have to.  00:08:58 Speaker 4  Could I ask you?  00:09:02 Speaker 2  A medication called Trazodone.  00:09:07 Speaker 4  I've added medication called.  00:09:12 Speaker 2  Mark 2. As the Mac tool.  00:09:25 Speaker 4  What other items you want?  00:09:27 Speaker 2  The Mac too.  00:09:34 Speaker 1  No.  00:09:34 Speaker 4  You have.  00:09:37  It's.  00:09:37 Speaker 4  What?  00:09:38 Speaker 3  What's happening is with the glasses when he talks, you guys can't hear because it's going through his glasses and the one that's talking is the actual device that's behind him. So.  00:09:52  Garment.  00:09:52 Speaker 3  Take it off.  00:09:55 Speaker 1  Ohh, I'm so sorry.  00:09:57 Speaker 3  But you're you're worthless. It made the. So on the main device.  00:10:01 Speaker 1  OK, perfect. It did make the list OK. Alright, that's good. But I mean we can also, you know use whichever 1 is more convenient because you M, you wear your glasses almost all all the time. Now I think you're so much more used to it. So we can, you know, do these commands using your glasses. Because I I think the two things together, it's it's becoming very difficult and challenging. So that's fine, you know, but for this next one, since it made the medication list already on Alexa, let's just try this next one on Alexa. But the next few ones, whichever Gemini live cannot be used for, we can try his glasses. Let's try. It OK? Yeah, that would be good. OK.  So M, the next command we have here is show your medication. Show me my medication list.  00:10:58 Speaker 2  Yeah, Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:08 Speaker 3  So.  00:11:09 Speaker 2  Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:17 Speaker 3  No, I think you have.  00:11:18 Speaker 2  To say Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:25 Speaker 3  She was the lines moving, but I think he's just a touched ohh. She did. She did.  00:11:31 Speaker 1  She did get it. OK. All right. On the on the iPad. OK.  00:11:35 Speaker 3  Medication called Trazodone. You've got Robitussin Tylenol cough drops and neosporin. No.  00:11:42 Speaker 2  OK. You're welcome.  00:11:44 Speaker 1  Did you did you Add all of them right now or was it only the Trazodone that he was trying to add?  00:11:53 Speaker 3  Right. The Trazodone tonight and the other ones were there from before.  00:11:58 Speaker 1  From before. OK, OK. Alright, M. When when you've used to manage medications, if you've used your glasses, do you check those medications off once you have received those medications? Or just leave them on the on the. List what do you do?  00:12:23 Speaker 2  I try to check them off, but if if I if I don't remember then they stay on.  00:12:27 Speaker 1  Then it stays on. OK got it. Right, that's that's why maybe from that that was the list from the previous times. Got it. OK. All right, so the next.  00:12:41 Speaker 3  Remember when we say show me, it shows it, it doesn't read.  00:12:46 Speaker 1  Right, it does not read it, yeah. That is, that is a that is. A drawback from Alexa I remember I I think from last time. So I think show and read me my medication list might be a better command for you M. So that yeah, it makes. OK. All right, let's try to find some over the counter medications, OK. Let's see. Alright, so the next command. Can you put your glasses back on and let's let's try it with the glasses because I think.  You use those more than. Your Alexa app.  00:13:31 Speaker 2  OK.  00:13:32 Speaker 1  OK, So what medication would you like to find if if you, if you wanted to know something or if you're curious about finding a medication?  00:13:42 Speaker 2  M.  00:13:45 Speaker 3  An over the counter, one not a prescription.  00:13:48 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:13:50 Speaker 3  Something over the counter. OK.  00:13:55 Speaker 2  Ibuprofen.  00:13:56 Speaker 1  OK, ibuprofen. So let's ask the command, let's do this command. Where do I find ibuprofen?  00:14:04 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, where do I find ibuprofen?  00:14:08 Speaker 1  OK.  00:14:12 Speaker 4  CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away.  00:14:17 Speaker 1  It's the device at the back that's talking correct. OK, that worked OK.  00:14:20  Yeah.  00:14:23 Speaker 1  How about let's compare the responses now, so that gave you some information. I couldn't hear that, but was that accurate like? So was it closed like the pharmacies or something?  00:14:35 Speaker 3  And. It listed pharmacies that are very close to our homes and the address.  00:14:36 Speaker 1  OK. Got it.  Which we're the address. OK, M, let's try that same command on with your glasses. So with meta.  00:14:52 Speaker 2  The matter?  In Maida. Where can I find ibuprofen?  00:15:10 Speaker 3  What did he say?  00:15:11 Speaker 2  Targets CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.  00:15:13 Speaker 1  OK. Was it listing the addresses as? Well.  00:15:17 Speaker 2  No.  00:15:18 Speaker 1  No. OK. So that's the difference. It's not giving a location for those pharmacies, it's it's just listing like regular pharmacies where you could find like or regular stores where you could find them.  00:15:32 Speaker 4  Yep.  00:15:33 Speaker 1  OK, alright.  00:15:34 Speaker 3  Should he try Gemini?  00:15:38 Speaker 1  We can try. Yeah, for sure. Let's let's give it a go.  00:15:42 Speaker 3  House.  00:15:44 Speaker 2  Hey, Jim and I are working to find ibuprofen.  00:15:50 Speaker 5  I couldn't find any stores that sell ibuprofen nearby. You could try searching online to see what's available.  00:15:56 Speaker 1  Hmm. OK, so location specific details are are the best like using Alexa I guess.  00:16:05 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:16:06 Speaker 1  Yeah, or maybe Siri. That would be similar, I guess, but uh, more or less. One of those tools rather than anything. Which is run within all the large language model I guess or an AI.  00:16:21 Speaker 3  What do you wanna know what Siri says?  00:16:25 Speaker 1  Sure.  00:16:26 Speaker 3  Oh yes.  00:16:27 Speaker 2  Hey Siri, where can I find ibuprofen?  00:16:33  I don't know where you are.  00:16:36 Speaker 2  Said I don't know where you are. XXXX(Address).  00:16:37 Speaker 3  Tell her where you are.  Oh, she didn't care.  00:16:46 Speaker 2  XXXX(Address)  00:16:48 Speaker 3  Have to wake her up.  00:16:50 Speaker 2  He's stirring. Hey Siri. XXXX(Address). Where do I find ibuprofen?  00:17:03 Speaker 4  You're welcome.  00:17:08 Speaker 3  Should we lost her? So. Try again to saying where do I find ibuprofen?  00:17:16 Speaker 2  Siri, where do I find you, Siri? Where do I find ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga?  00:17:23 Speaker 5  They don't seem to be able to get your current location.  00:17:27 Speaker 1  Is is the location on on this phone.  00:17:31 Speaker 3  It's. For sharing.  It should be, you know.  00:17:34 Speaker 1  That's so odd. Usually it's it's so good at picking up location if it's a phone, but.  00:17:40 Speaker 3  So.  00:17:41 Speaker 2  Siri, where do I find ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga?  00:17:47  I don't know where you are.  00:17:49 Speaker 5  OK, I found this on the web for ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga.  00:17:53  Check it out.  00:17:56 Speaker 3  And that's where Siri is the downfall. It she'll tell you where she found it, but you have to be able to see what she all.  00:17:56  1st.  00:18:05 Speaker 3  Oh, not read it aloud to you.  00:18:08 Speaker 1  Ohh got it. So I wonder if maybe we might have to add.  Like list those.  00:18:18 Speaker 3  Or.  00:18:21 Speaker 1  Yeah, that's that's tough, I know.  00:18:23 Speaker 3  That's the serious issue, but.  The Alexa. Tells you the name of the place and an address, yeah. And Gemini and Maida just tells you the name of the stores.  00:18:39 Speaker 1  Right.  00:18:40 Speaker 3  And.  00:18:40 Speaker 1  I think.  00:18:42 Speaker 3  Gemini is very limited.  00:18:44 Speaker 1  Yeah, I think if we, if we probably gave Gemini like in advance we said that this is my address and then ask.  Where can I find ibuprofen? It probably might work, but again, I'm not sure.  00:19:02 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:19:03 Speaker 1  Yeah, yeah, but that's again a lot of commands. I feel like it it has to be simple enough. And the best part about Alexa is that he can use his glasses to turn like, you know, turn on Alexa on his, like, the app on his phone or the iPad. And then he can say the command. So that makes it much easier to navigate. And seeing less number of words and comments.  00:19:30 Speaker 3  Very much.  It's the same as when you're in the actual store. He's wearing the glasses and he's asking.  A what's on my list grocery list. And she will tell him and he'll say check off tomatoes, whatever it is. And when you're in a store, it's coming. It's very indiscreet because it's coming. He only he really hears the voice. And so it's very discreet.  00:19:44 Speaker 1  MHM.  00:20:03 Speaker 3  Correct.  00:20:05 Speaker 1  Though that he has those now, I I think I think that's making it so much easier for him to navigate. M, are you enjoying those? Because it makes you. How does that make you feel?  00:20:06  Yeah.  00:20:18 Speaker 2  They make me feel good, they play music and they make me feel.  Secure.  00:20:26 Speaker 1  That's good. OK.  That's amazing. All right, let's move on. Alright so.  Here we have. Learning to do laundry, but we can do something else. Is there something else related to self-care or caring for your dog?  That.  A kind of question you might want to ask which could be, yeah, anything related to your care, your family's care, self-care, or your dogs, you know well-being.  Anything, anything of that sort that you would like to ask?  00:21:08 Speaker 2  And.  00:21:10 Speaker 1  OK, what can you think of?  00:21:15 Speaker 2  And said to a.  00:21:19 Speaker 3  Well, don't tell Priel first.  00:21:22 Speaker 2  Trial. Alright. Hey, Creole, can I say to Alex?  00:21:28 Speaker 1  OK, uh, what? What would you like to ask though?  00:21:34 Speaker 2  When can I feed my dog or no? My dog drink water?  00:21:40 Speaker 1  When can my dog dog drink?  Water. Is that what you said?  00:21:43 Speaker 2  Yeah, one kind of allow my dog to drink.  Water. OK. Yeah, sure. Hey, Alex.  I'm trying to allow my dog to drink water.  00:21:53 Speaker 4  Something.  00:22:02 Speaker 2  It's in the com reference.com puppies could start drinking water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:09 Speaker 1  Sorry, I can't hear you. What? What did. What did you say?  00:22:12 Speaker 3  Say it louder, M.  00:22:14 Speaker 2  She said here's something from here's something I found on reference.com. It's.  Puppies are allowed to drink water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:26 Speaker 1  OK.  00:22:26 Speaker 3  They can drink water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:28 Speaker 1  When they're three weeks old, OK, was.  Does that answer your question?  Or do we need to? Did you mean that how many times a day or?  00:22:38 Speaker 2  How many times a day?  00:22:39 Speaker 3  What are?  00:22:40 Speaker 1  The indications for me to give my dog water or something like that.  00:22:46 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, what are the indications for me to get my dog water?  I think she heard me, but she shut off.  00:23:00 Speaker 3  Say it louder, my.  00:23:01 Speaker 2  Hey, Alexa, what are the indications to get my dog drink water?  00:23:08 Speaker 4  There's something I found on you get your dog to make sure there's constant access. And. Chicken broth.  00:23:35 Speaker 3  Lot of information, lot of information.  00:23:36 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:23:40 Speaker 1  Could you process and like? Could? Could you remember any of the details that it just said? No, it was a lot.  00:23:48 Speaker 3  What were some of the details, M?  00:23:49 Speaker 2  The dog.  Small amounts of urine.  Take her to the hospital or the vet.  00:23:56 Speaker 1  OK.  00:23:57 Speaker 2  But the. Excuse me.  00:24:05 Speaker 1  You're OK? No worries.  00:24:08 Speaker 3  What else did she say?  00:24:10 Speaker 2  He said. I don't know. I can't remember.  00:24:17 Speaker 3  Did she say to put one bowl of water out or lots of multiple bowls of water?  00:24:22 Speaker 1  Multiple bowls of water.  Do you do that for Roxy? No. Maybe she does she.  Know, though, that that's where she drinks water.  Probably does. Yeah. All right. Do you want to try that same command for Gemini? Maybe because that would, I think that kind of question we could try live with with Gemini and see if that would give some similar or different information. Let's try.  00:24:54 Speaker 2  Hey, Jim and I, where can I? When can I allow my dog to drink water?  00:25:00 Speaker 5  If your dog just had surgery, it's best to check with your vet about when they can have water. Usually they'll say to wait a couple of hours and give them just a little at first. If your dog hasn't had surgery, then they can have water whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:13 Speaker 1  OK, that was pretty good.  00:25:17 Speaker 2  And then when whenever when is whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:18 Speaker 1  I've got.  00:25:25 Speaker 5  That's right. Dogs can drink water whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:31 Speaker 1  OK.  00:25:31 Speaker 2  Probably seem thirsty, Gemini.  00:25:35 Speaker 5  If your dog is panting a lot, drooling, or has dry looking gums, they might be thirsty. Sometimes they'll also lick their lips or look for their water bowl.  00:25:45 Speaker 1  That's amazing, M. I loved that you could ask a follow up question like that. That's amazing.  00:25:52 Speaker 2  Thank you.  00:25:53 Speaker 1  Yeah, but, and that was really good information according to me. What did. What did you think, M?  00:26:00 Speaker 2  I thought so too.  00:26:01 Speaker 1  Yeah, that was short and to the point and it gave you whatever you needed, I guess.  Did that answer your question?  00:26:09 Speaker 2  Yeah, it did.  00:26:10 Speaker 1  OK, alright, that's great. Now let's go. Let's move on.  Alright, so there are more questions about how to OK, this was all about the laundry that we talked last time. Let's try one of these. So getting so this is about getting stains out of clothes. So do you want to ask Gemini?  What do I use to get get stains out of my clothes?  00:26:40 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini.  When can I get? Where do I get or what do I use to get stains out of my clothes?  00:26:49 Speaker 5  There are lots of things you can use to get stains out of clothes. It kind of depends on what kind of stain it is. Do you know what stains your clothes?  00:26:56 Speaker 2  Bleach.  00:27:00  Did you say bleep?  00:27:01 Speaker 5  OK, for bleach stains, you'll want to use something.  00:27:05  Sorry.  00:27:06 Speaker 5  Yes, I can still hear you.  No worries. Take your time.  00:27:12 Speaker 2  Tomatoes.  Tomato juice.  00:27:20 Speaker 5  Tomato juice stains can be a bit tricky. First, try blotting up as much of the juice as you can, then rinse the stain in cold water. If it's still there, try rubbing some dish soap into the stain and washing.  It again OK.  00:27:33 Speaker 3  OK, what I what I noticed is M's.  00:27:35 Speaker 5  OK, got it.  00:27:40 Speaker 3  Didn't have a concise question to begin with.  He said what I mean where I mean and she still answered the question. Yes, that is the difference between, I guess the two systems, right? Absolutely.  It's.  00:27:58 Speaker 1  Even if there is some hesitation to begin with or during the question or the command, it will still. So take the.  Question in a context. So it kind of.  Understands the OR like you know, understands the context I could.  Say.  And then answers that question. So that is that is a good thing about using these AI tools, I guess.  00:28:25 Speaker 3  And that's a little bit more superior to Siri.  Because she's more literal.  And Alexa is kind of not as literal as Siri, but a little bit. Gemini is more forgiving.  00:28:33 Speaker 4  Mm-hmm.  00:28:45 Speaker 3  Of the three.  00:28:46 Speaker 1  I think. Ohh yeah, yeah.  When you ask if you do, you have you had any?  Success with using the glasses to ask questions like this, like for information related to self-care.  00:29:05 Speaker 2  And for the most part.  00:29:06 Speaker 3  Do you want to try the same question here you guys?  00:29:11 Speaker 1  So the question is, what do I use to get stains out of my clothes?  00:29:17 Speaker 2  In meta.  What do I use to get stains?  In my clothes.  What if my stainless bleeps?  Cherries and sour Oxiclean, or take it to a professional cleaner.  00:29:51 Speaker 3  OK.  00:29:51  Try.  00:29:52 Speaker 1  Take it to the professional cleaners and.  00:29:54 Speaker 3  It said try shout or Oxiclean or you could try taking it to a.  00:29:59 Speaker 1  Professional. Cleaner. OK, alright. I mean that seems like valid information to me. I'm not sure but but it does. Yeah, I mean.  That's comparable to what? Gemini offered, I guess like it was short. But and to the.  Point, but still gave all the details that you needed for.  I think.  00:30:22 Speaker 3  Yes, I think the key for both Maida and Gemini.  Your follow up question has to be relatively quick. You can't at too much time pass before asking that follow up or it's too late.  00:30:38 Speaker 1  Bing.  Yeah. Otherwise I think the system times out and then you might.  Have to start again.  00:30:45 Speaker 3  Yes. And so that's what M's been working on is follow up questions like this.  00:30:52 Speaker 1  Yeah. Yeah. But I think there I feel like there's such a change from the previous year to this year, just in conversation. I feel, M, I think you're doing really great, has been a good, good amount of progress that I can see from last summer to this summer.  Yes, when it comes to just conversational. And everything I think you know and I. Think the glasses are?  Great. I think they're helping a lot too. And of course, this year and if everything together, I think the therapies and all of that together.  00:31:25 Speaker 3  Definitely.  00:31:32 Speaker 1  OK. Let's see how many we have 5 minutes. OK. All right. M, anything related to self-care that you can think of that you would still want to ask Gemini or Alexa or your glasses? No, you can you can you practice a couple more commands.  00:31:53 Speaker 2  Yep.  00:31:55 Speaker 1  OK. All right, let's see. So I think with finding a doctor, it will again be the best. If we tried with Alexa because.  It's going to it's location specific information so.  We can try.  Let's try Alexa.  For finding a type of doctor, maybe. Let's let's see. Could do you think, uh, what kind of doctor would you like to find?  00:32:33 Speaker 2  Physical therapist.  00:32:36 Speaker 1  OK, let's try with Alexa first.  And then Gemini, let's see if that would.  00:32:44 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, find me a physical therapist.  00:32:50 Speaker 4  We found a few options for that.  Physical therapy 3.1 miles away from Rochester Ave. 3 miles away. Physical therapy 3 miles away.  00:33:08 Speaker 3  It gave three options, the title how far away it was. Yeah. Is that OK?  00:33:17 Speaker 2  Yes.  00:33:19 Speaker 1  Yeah, OK, that's great. And it it is definitely listing all of that along with showing it on the screen. If there is a screen, so.  That's a good part.  Let's try.  Let's try maybe with the glasses, M, because I know that Gemini will not allow you to go live with this because it's probably location specific again.  So let's ask. The same question to Mera find me.  A physical therapist.  00:33:52 Speaker 2  Middle. The medic.  Find me a physical therapist.  To make sure the we're setting to make sure the.  00:34:14 Speaker 3  Location.  00:34:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, location is on for meta.  00:34:17 Speaker 1  Location specific. It's. Yeah. OK, so here's a good way. I think when they're if you have your glasses on and you're trying to, you know, find information that is location specific. The best option in in any situation would be because you would have your phone or your iPad, which would have the Alexa app. So you tell your glasses to open the Alexa app and you know and and then then use the command like you know, finding a doctor or, you know creating.Medication like I think what was the other one that we had difficulty with? Uh.  Ohh yeah. Finding the over the counter medications or you know, things like that, I guess that it would it, it would help a lot. I I think to just use the glasses to.  Turn turn Alexa on on an on either of those devices, the phone or iPad, whatever he has. But I think like the information related.  Questions were pretty good on Gemini and made. Up both so.  Maybe we could try 1 of this. M, let's try this. How do I treat a migraine on your meta glasses? Let's see what it says.  00:35:44 Speaker 2  In metal. How do I treat a migraine?  00:35:59 Speaker 4  Having. It set.  00:36:00 Speaker 2  Said for ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Or consult the doctor for another advice.  00:36:08 Speaker 1  OK. All right. So that's that's good information, I think and. All right. Do you want to try the same one on Gemini and compare the answers?  00:36:25 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini. How can I treat a migraine?  00:36:33 Speaker 5  Migraines can be really tough over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help. Sometimes a cold compress on your forehead or a warm bath can ease the pain too. Just a reminder that I don't provide medical advice or diagnosis. You should always talk to a medical professional.  00:36:51 Speaker 1  OK. OK. M, can you tell me? Which one had better information according to you?  00:37:00 Speaker 2  The Gemini.  00:37:01 Speaker 1  Gemini. Why do you think?  00:37:06 Speaker 2  She said because. I can't give medical advice.  00:37:11 Speaker 5  OK, great.  00:37:14 Speaker 1  OK. Alright, so it kind of gave a disclaimer that it cannot provide like any medical advice and. Well, which is good and that's why you were you would pick Gemini or Mera in this one.  00:37:34 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:37:34 Speaker 1  Yeah.  It also gave one extra information. I don't know if Maeda gave that to you, but.  Did Meda also tell about the cold compress?  00:37:48 Speaker 2  No.  00:37:48 Speaker 3  Or just.  00:37:50 Speaker 1  Yeah, it it just I think you told me only about ibuprofen and then the OR a doctor visit the doctor. So there was one extra piece of information which can be like you know, I think some people might benefit from that.  Yeah, I I mean, I have heard some people would probably use like a cold compress. So which is a good information, good piece of information.  To have, I guess.  Yeah. OK.  Alright, I think we are good, but.  I don't know.  If if you do you have anything else, M, that you would like to try on either of the tools that we have related to?  And self-care medical needs or carrying out the dog or anything, anything at all.   00:38:43 Speaker 2  No.  00:38:44 Speaker 3  I have an idea.  00:38:46 Speaker 4  Yeah.  00:38:46 Speaker 3  You're talking about laundry and self-care on the live. When I tried the live at the beach, it just took a picture, kind of like an app called seeing AI. So if I'm going to put it on live, I'll get M to ask and I'll turn the camera on him.  00:39:06 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:39:06 Speaker 3  What am I wearing? Because as a blind person, you would like to know what you're wearing, right? It does. It. Does that sound good? Let's just try to see if it'll work because it's kind of related.  00:39:12 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:39:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  00:39:19 Speaker 3  OK.  00:39:21 Speaker 2  In Germany.  00:39:23 Speaker 4  I gotta turn the camera facing.  00:39:25 Speaker 2  Gemini.  00:39:26 Speaker 4  One minute, please.  00:39:31 Speaker 3  So.  00:39:32 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini. What am I wearing?  00:39:37 Speaker 5  I can't tell what you're wearing from here. Could you show me again?  00:39:42 Speaker 2  In Germany, what am I wearing?  00:39:52 Speaker 5  I can't see what you're wearing.  00:39:55 Speaker 3  I can't. That's what color your shirt.  00:39:58 Speaker 2  Is and Gemini? What color is my shirt?  00:40:00 Speaker 5  I can't see what you're wearing.  00:40:03  Oh.  00:40:03 Speaker 3  I and it's looking right at him. Like you can see M in the screen.  00:40:08 Speaker 1  In in the in the frame OK.  00:40:10  Yeah.  00:40:14 Speaker 5  OK, I can't tell what color your shirt.  Is.  00:40:19 Speaker 1  That's interesting.  00:40:21 Speaker 3  Ohh that is yeah, because it's not able to get the color.  00:40:26 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:40:29 Speaker 3  What color is my shirt?  00:40:29 Speaker 5  Yeah, not able to identify.  I can't tell what color your shirt is.  00:40:35 Speaker 3  I mean.  Books by Jennifer Keller.  00:40:38 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK, that's pretty interesting, I know.  00:40:45 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:40:45 Speaker 1  Because you have your front camera on and it it's it. I mean, he's in the frame, and even then it's not. Probably does it? Do you think that if you like if the front camera were to be on and you took a picture and then it would?  Be able to.  And then if you like entered it on there and then it. Would be able to talk.  00:41:13 Speaker 5  I can't use Google lens yet when we are live. For now, going live is great for things like chatting, finding answers or brainstorming new ideas.  00:41:21 Speaker 1  Got it. So.  00:41:23 Speaker 3  OK.  Are the Google ends at the top and that's what I pushed and there was nothing.  00:41:30  Nothing.  00:41:32 Speaker 3  And here. What color is my shirt?  00:41:42 Speaker 5  I'm having trouble identifying the color of your shirt. It looks like it could be pink.  00:41:46 Speaker 3  Oh, it looks like it could be pink. OK.  00:41:47 Speaker 1  Looks like OK.  00:41:50 Speaker 3  Maybe it's the lighting.  00:41:53 Speaker 1  Yeah, but you know, it should still say you know how it said for you that it could be pink.  00:42:00 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:42:00 Speaker 1  It would at least the lives 1-2 would be able to. You would think that it would be.  Able to give.  You an option at least that ohh it would. It seems like it could be this.  00:42:10 Speaker 3  Sir. Yeah, and that was using the live.  00:42:15 Speaker 1  That was using the.  00:42:16 Speaker 3  OK. And this is right this top. So maybe that's why it saw it right?  00:42:18 Speaker 1  OK.  It probably could be.  Yeah, yeah, probably this the version that you know how there's a free version of Gemini that we are using.  All of the versions are not as as advanced so.  That that could be.  It also, but yeah, I don't know.  00:42:48 Speaker 3  Yeah. Yeah. All right, that's great. Let's see.  00:42:57 Speaker 1  Right, M, I think you did a great job. Do you have anything else that you'd like to?  Share.  00:43:03 Speaker 2  No.  00:43:04 Speaker 3  No. OK, what's easier for you to use you like the Gemini?  And do you like using Alexa with your glasses?  00:43:15 Speaker 2  Yep.  00:43:16 Speaker 1  Yeah, with the glasses, I guess the I mean anything location specific or date or event specific that he has to do like calendar specific I would say I guess using the glasses to either connect it to Siri or wherever his calendar is or Alexa that would be.  That would be very good. I guess that that still works better.  00:43:40 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:43:40 Speaker 1  But I think with information Gemini.  Did a great job. I guess when it came to.  Providing short information, but still you know it's still concise, but to the point and directing it.  00:43:49 Speaker 3  Yes it will.  00:43:55 Speaker 1  Pretty well I guess.  00:43:56 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:43:58 Speaker 1  OK. I'll see you guys in the break in the main room actually, OK.  00:44:04 Speaker 3  Get ready to share something to R, M.  00:44:08 Speaker 2  Alright.     , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  It appears you have provided a detailed explanation of the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\nThe SOAP note is a structured method of documenting patient encounters that helps healthcare workers assess, diagnose, and treat patients effectively. It consists of four sections: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n1. **Subjective**: This section contains the patient's subjective experiences, personal views, or feelings about their condition. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI), which provides context for the assessment and plan.\n\n2. **Objective**: This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. **Assessment**: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, lists the problem, differential diagnoses, and discusses the plan for each problem.\n\n4. **Plan**: This section details the need for additional testing, specialist referrals, patient education, counseling, and any therapy needed (medications).\n\nThe SOAP note helps improve communication among healthcare professionals and ensures a comprehensive and efficient assessment and treatment plan for patients. However, it does have some limitations, such as the inability to document changes over time effectively. Extensions to the SOAP model, like SOAPE, have been proposed to address this gap.\n\nIn the provided conversation, the subjective information includes the patient's chief complaint (chest pain) and history of present illness (describing the chest pain). The objective information might include findings from a physical exam or laboratory tests. The assessment could involve considering potential causes for the chest pain based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, and the plan might involve ordering further tests or prescribing medication. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  To improve the response from the language model, it could be beneficial to provide more specific examples of the plan section in a SOAP note, particularly focusing on self-care tools like Alexa, Gemini, and Meta Glasses. This will help better align the generated SOAP note with the target SOAP note.\n\nIn the plan section, instead of just stating that \"the plan might involve ordering further tests or prescribing medication,\" it would be helpful to provide examples of how these tools can help with self-care in specific scenarios. For instance:\n\n* Alexa: Alexa can assist in setting reminders for medication reminders, schedule appointments, and even order prescription refills through compatible services (e.g., Amazon Pharmacy).\n* Gemini: In addition to providing information on over-the-counter medications and treatment options, Gemini can also help with tracking daily routines such as exercise or diet plans, and reminders for pet care like feeding schedules or water changes for fish tanks.\n* Meta Glasses: Meta Glasses can provide real-time health monitoring data, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and even glucose readings (if compatible with wearer's medical devices), which can help users better manage their health and share this information with healthcare providers.\n\nBy providing more detailed examples of how each tool can contribute to self-care in various scenarios, the response from the language model will not only better match the target SOAP note but also provide valuable and actionable insights for users interested in leveraging these technologies for their self-care needs. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?\u201d  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  \u201cTrazadone\u201d  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week\u2019s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. \u201cIs there a fact you would like to know?\u201d) M.A. practice the following commands: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?\u201d  -  \u201c Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cFor  the  gym\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?\u201d  -  \u201cAlexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?\u201d   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying \u201csuch as___\u201d to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.\u2019s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as \u201cWho do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?\u201d  and  \u201cIs  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?\u201d.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  news  and  facts.  Please  practice  these  five commands with your Alexa.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Individual training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver \nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A. \nSpeaker 3: Clinician \nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa \nSpeaker 5: Clinician \nSpeaker 6: Clinician \nSpeaker 7: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver \nSpeaker 8: Clinician\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nWe did the.

Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  In response to your request for a SOAP note on the topic \"Ensuring the structure and style of the provided text follows the rubric for a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note\", I have provided an example SOAP note below:\n\nTitle: Ensuring the Structure and Style of Text Follows the Rubric for a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) Note\n\nSubjective\nChief Complaint (CC): Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI): The text does not follow the required structure and style of a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nHistory: No pertinent past medical history is mentioned.\nReview of Systems (ROS): Not applicable as no symptoms or conditions have been reported.\nCurrent Medications, Allergies: Not applicable as no medications or allergies have been documented.\n\nObjective\nVital signs: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPhysical exam findings: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nLaboratory data: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nImaging results: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nRecognition and review of documentation of other clinicians: The text does not demonstrate adherence to the SOAP note structure, indicating a lack of collaboration and shared understanding among healthcare providers.\n\nAssessment\nProblem: Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style, leading to inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nDifferential Diagnosis: It is unclear if there are other underlying issues contributing to the lack of adherence to the SOAP note structure and style.\nDiscussion: The text demonstrates a lack of understanding or adherence to the required structure and style for a SOAP note, making it difficult to quickly understand the patient's status and the assessment and plan for their care.\n\nPlan\nTesting needed: Educational interventions to teach proper documentation techniques in accordance with the SOAP note rubric.\nTherapy needed (medications): Not applicable as medications are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults: Not applicable as specialists are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPatient education, counseling: Provide educational materials on the importance and benefits of using a SOAP note structure, along with training on proper documentation techniques.\n\nThe text provided does not follow the required structure and style for a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation. To address this issue, it is recommended to provide educational interventions to teach proper documentation techniques in accordance with the SOAP note rubric, along with training on proper documentation techniques. Additionally, providing educational materials on the importance and benefits of using a SOAP note structure may help encourage adherence to the required format. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  To improve the response of the language model, it would be beneficial to provide a more specific and actionable suggestion for encouraging adherence to the SOAP note format. Instead of simply mentioning that educational materials might help encourage adherence, the language model could suggest strategies such as:\n\n1. Providing clear templates or examples of well-structured SOAP notes that the user can follow. This would give them a concrete starting point and make it easier to learn the format.\n2. Integrating feedback mechanisms into the system to automatically evaluate the user's SOAP note submissions and provide constructive criticism where necessary, helping them to improve their skills over time.\n3. Offering guided practice sessions where the user can work through a series of exercises designed to reinforce proper SOAP note structure and style. This could include interactive quizzes or games that help make the learning process more engaging and enjoyable.\n4. Providing ongoing support and resources, such as regular check-ins with a mentor or coach who can offer personalized feedback and guidance on how to improve the user's SOAP note writing skills.\n5. Implementing gamification elements, such as points, badges, or leaderboards, to motivate users to strive for perfection in their SOAP note submissions and compete against others in a friendly and positive environment.\n\nBy offering a more specific and actionable suggestion for encouraging adherence to the SOAP note format, the language model's response would be more helpful and informative, thereby improving its ability to achieve the objective of helping users improve their skills in writing SOAP notes. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Here's a summary:\n\nFunction: The SOAP note serves as a structured method for healthcare providers to document patient encounters in an organized way, providing a framework for evaluating information, diagnosing, and treating patients effectively.\n\nStructure:\n1. Subjective: This section includes the patient's symptoms, history of present illness (HPI), medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, review of systems (ROS), current medications, and allergies.\n2. Objective: This section documents vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n3. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n4. Plan: This section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, therapy needed (medications), specialist referrals, and any other follow-up steps.\n\nIssues of Concern:\n1. Order of information: While the traditional SOAP note follows Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan order, rearranging it to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) may provide quick access to ongoing care information and improve efficiency.\n2. Time integration: The original SOAP model does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap.\n3. Data volume: The shift to electronic documentation has led to the inclusion of large volumes of data, which can burden clinicians if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize relevant information for easy access and efficient diagnosis and treatment. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  Based on the given target and generated SOAP notes, I'll analyze the differences between them.\n\nThe target SOAP note has a clear Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan structure that aligns with the conventional SOAP format. In contrast, the generated SOAP note seems to lack the Subjective and Objective sections, focusing only on Assessment and Plan for two different topics (Selfcare and Medical Needs, Meal Preparation).\n\nSince the target SOAP note includes detailed information about the patient's interaction and progress during the session, while the generated one is more focused on discussing specific actions taken related to the mentioned topics, I would assign a loss score of 5. This is because although there are differences in structure and content, they still convey information relevant to the patient encounter.\n\nA perfect match (score 0) would require the generated SOAP note to include all sections (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and provide detailed information about the patient's interaction and progress during the session, similar to the target SOAP note. A completely different SOAP note (score 10) would provide minimal or no relevant information related to the patient encounter. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: MA, Speaker 3 MA\u2019s mom, Speaker 4 Gemini, Speaker 5  RT, Speaker 6    Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  There we go.  00:00:04 Speaker 2  Thank you. Alright. So M, tell me how how is it going? Have you tried using Gemini at?  All like this past week.  00:00:16 Speaker 3  Yeah, me and my mom each on Tuesday. And she asked me to use general find out what we're looking at. And I asked Gemma what we were looking at.  00:00:29 Speaker 2  Sorry, where were you at but. Did you go somewhere you said?  00:00:32 Speaker 3  Alicia Alicia beach.  00:00:35 Speaker 2  Ohh OK oh, that was that was the week before, is that correct?  00:00:39 Speaker 4  Yeah, as well as this.  00:00:41 Speaker 2  Week oh, this week too. OK, OK, so that was new.  00:00:45 Speaker 4  I'm still on summer break for a week, so we've been. Going to the beach at. Least weekly.  00:00:49 Speaker 2  That's nice. OK. OK, I got it. So then how was it different from the first time?  00:00:58 Speaker 3  Well. Ask Gemini might to somewhere we're looking at and we're on live. It looks like you guys are at the beach. And then.  You said, do you guys, are you guys having fun? I said, yeah.  00:01:15 Speaker 4  She asked if we're having fun the first week that we asked her. She did not ask that the second week did say it looks like you're at the beach.  00:01:27 Speaker 2  Got it. OK. Did it say anything about the weather or what's in the environment or nothing, just about just that you you are you are at the beach, that's all?  00:01:40 Speaker 3  Yeah, just.  00:01:40 Speaker 4  And it. Yeah. And it also like it picked up the legs. I think it picked up M's legs because he was holding the phone. And so it said it in the four ground, it shows feet or leg, something along those lines as those. And also it it took him the whole view of what it seemed. We were trying to compare it or I was trying to compare it to an app called be my eyes which is an app that the blind community uses and you can hold up your phone with be my eyes on it or you can use it through your glasses and it will. Be my eyes is where you can call a volunteer and they will describe what's going on around. A person. So I'm just trying to compare it to different things on the yeah.  00:02:38 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's interesting. OK, alright. OK. So would you say that that was a better fit when you wanted to sort of see something or ask about information about any picture or anything that's like live in front of him?  00:02:59 Speaker 4  I'd say the live is really good to be honest with you. The other thing we used it for, remember in the car when we were driving.  M's dad is from Australia. He was telling M a story about a ship that was a boat that was shipwrecked in like the 70s. And so we asked Gemini what boat was shipped wrecked in Brisbane, Australia. In the 70s and within seconds. It came back with the name and blah blah blah and my husband's going. That's exactly right. And he was some obscure thing that happened in the 70s that really didn't make worldwide news.  00:03:47 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah. So it's really digging information from. Like even the so much so many years back. So which is which is great and it's A and and the good part is that it.  Was accurate, yes.  00:04:00 Speaker 4  Yeah, it was. It was. It was for an obscure fact. It was. You know, like when was World War 2?  00:04:08 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah, OK. Well, nice. That's that's very good to know. OK, I'm gonna share my screen so we can. Get on with this. So this is going to be a little different from last year. We're just gonna do a final review where so we're just gonna review each week's learnings and then I'll provide you with an like an open-ended prompt for any like that particular topic. Of the week. And then we'll. Both of us together, M or even Mom, we can come up with two voice commands per topic and practice those using either Alexa, Gemini or even for you. Your glasses, whichever is is the best fit based on the command that you want to or the activity that you want to practice. OK, alright. So. So let's see where we we start here. So this is information seeking that was the first topic that we discussed and the topics that were covered during that week was about asking about the weather making and. Deleting to do lists, adding events to a calendar, local, asking about local and international news. And information related to sporting events or any kind of other information that you're curious about, you could ask. Those are sort of like the broad topics that we covered for information seeking that week. So let's find 2 tasks that you would like to practice. Related to information seeking and practice, those using either Gemini, your glasses, or Alexa. So let's see what you pick and then we'll decide based on that. If if that makes sense.  00:06:09 Speaker 4  What would you like to do, M?  00:06:12 Speaker 3  When is it going to rain next?  00:06:14 Speaker 4  OK, so to ask about the weather, which. Platform do you think would be better germini. OK, just let me open my phone.  00:06:33 Speaker 2  Are you asking about the weather in your area or is there somewhere you're going or you're curious about?  00:06:42 Speaker 4  Local or do you want to find out where your sister's at?  00:06:45 Speaker 3  State weather.  00:06:49 Speaker 4  OK, go with this. I'll turn the volume up high so she can hear. OK, you ready?  00:06:58 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemina.  00:06:59 Speaker 3  What is the local state weather?  00:07:05 Speaker 5  In state it's 83 and sunny today it'll be sunny with a high of 86 and.  A low of 60.  00:07:12 Speaker 3  Is it going? To rain this soon.  00:07:16 Speaker 5  Currently, there's no chance of rain.  00:07:20 Speaker 3  That makes sense.  00:07:23 Speaker 2  OK, very good.  00:07:24 Speaker 5  OK, you'd like to know if it's.  00:07:29 Speaker 2  That's perfect. OK. All right, what did you? Is that very where your sister lives or what did you say?  00:07:37 Speaker 4  Did so I asked if M wanted to ask where his sisters cause his sister is in Africa, right? Now. Ohh. I at. If you want to ask what the.  Weather where she's at.  00:07:48 Speaker 2  OK, OK, got it. Got it. OK, that was really good. M, I think you did a great job and I think it picked up your command really easily and it it seems like it provided the appropriate weather conditions and everything and also chances of rain. So that's that's great.  Good job asking a follow-up question, M, that was very good. Yeah, alright, let's find another task that or another task or activity related to information seeking that you would like to ask.  00:08:23 Speaker 4  You know what you want to ask?  00:08:25 Speaker 3  Gemini, what's your favorite color?  00:08:26 Speaker 4  No, no, no. Let's not do favorite color. Let's think information setting or something in the world, something global, something.  00:08:36 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemini. What's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:39 Speaker 4  No, it's tap the phone.  00:08:45 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemma, what's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:49 Speaker 5  Africa is a big place, so the weather varies a lot. It could be hot and dry in the Sahara or warm and humid in the.  Congo do. Have a specific country or city in mind.  00:08:58 Speaker 3  Tanzania.  00:09:02 Speaker 5  OK, in Tanzania it's currently 71\u00b0 and partly cloudy. It's going to be mostly sunny with a high of 82 and a low of 69\u00b0.  00:09:12 Speaker 3  About Kenya.  00:09:17 Speaker 5  OK, in Nairobi, Kenya, it's currently 55\u00b0 and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 77\u00b0 and the low is 54\u00b0.  00:09:27 Speaker 3  In Uganda.  00:09:32 Speaker 5  OK. In Kampala, Uganda it's currently 64\u00b0 and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 81\u00b0 and the low is 63\u00b0.  00:09:43 Speaker 2  That's great.  00:09:44 Speaker 3  581 in the low 64.  00:09:45 Speaker 4  Yeah, those are the three places his sister is. Going to be.  00:09:50 Speaker 2  OK. That makes sense. OK, way. To go like with asking all those. Follow-ups, M again, great job.  00:09:57 Speaker 3  Thank you.  00:09:58 Speaker 2  OK. So that I think the live is working much better when whenever he's using Gemini. I guess when in the first session when we are trying to do the weather related questions it was. It was not taking the place. Remember the location and then we had to sort of say the location I think doing live makes like I think it it catches the location on its own or something.  00:10:27 Speaker 4  I agree, and I think live for M especially is a lot easier because when you're not on live, you have to touch the button at the bottom, the microphone and then if you want to stop, you have to find the stop button at the top of the phone. And when you use voiceover, you can do that, but you have to go through it will read every single section.  00:10:54 Speaker 2  Yeah, right.  00:10:57 Speaker 4  Live you just touch the screen anywhere and away you go. Touch the screen again. And it stops.  00:11:03 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's that is really good, I think, yeah, I I I'm glad we found that and found it really quick early on in the training.  00:11:11 Speaker 2  So that has helped a lot. I feel alright, so move on.  00:11:16 Speaker 4  And M can also ask S you know who else is to open up that app and then go to live and it it will just do.  00:11:26 Speaker 2  It OK. Alright, so that's even better because if no one's around you, he could always do that, right, M? Like you can ask. Your phone phones assistant starting with us and and just say that open or like start live on on Gemini or something.  00:11:45 Speaker 3  Yeah. OK.  00:11:48 Speaker 2  OK. So M, the next topic we or we talked about was entertainment. This was I think on one of the Tuesdays that you were not not here and you were at your therapy session. So from last year you might remember that we talked about the different topics under entertainment. It was related to searching information related to media, listening to music, watching movie. These with Gemini and AI tools you can also generate stories and generate any content like generate new content and new stories and you can also tell jokes and play trivia games like you were able to on Alexa. So if you. Were to do. Two tasks related to entertainment. What would you pick?  00:12:41 Speaker 3  Or task. Who made V for Vendetta the movie? 00:12:45 Speaker 2  OK. All right, so UM and what would you, which platform would you use? Which tool you would use for that? It could be your glasses or Gemini or even Alexa or your phones assistant.  00:13:06 Speaker 3  Wanna ask Gemini?  00:13:07  Speaker 2 OK. All right, let's try.  00:13:10 Speaker 4  Go ahead.  00:13:11 Speaker 3  Hey Gemini, who made the V for Vendetta movie?  00:13:17 Speaker 5  V for Vendetta was directed by James Mcteigue of the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis, who were famous for the Matrix movies.  00:13:27 Speaker 2  Is that correct, M?  00:13:28 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:13:29 Speaker 2 OK. Alright,  00:13:31 Speaker 4  M, what do you use on a multiple times during the day with your glasses? What do you ask your glasses? No, you don't. What do you do multiple times and I have to ask you to please stop. No play. No. Player. And play his music multiple times, OK, He uses his glasses a lot to play his music because it will play music from.  00:14:05 Speaker 3  Apple music.  00:14:06 Speaker 4  Apple music or from Amazon? It'll he has to.  00:14:10 Speaker 2  Tell it. OK. Alright. Do you want to try using one of those commands and see? So when you when you use that command does it that will directly come via your earphones of the of your glasses, correct?  00:14:24 Speaker 3  Yeah, yeah.  00:14:25 Speaker 2  OK, alright. We can try that, that works. OK. Whenever you're ready and whatever music you want to play.  00:14:37 Speaker 4  What do you want to listen to?  00:14:39 Speaker 3  It's on my phone.  00:14:40 Speaker 4  OK. Can you say the command? Is it playing the music automatically? It's playing the music automatically.  00:14:50 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:14:54 Speaker 2  OK, so without even.  00:14:56 Speaker 4  Playing sometimes M will say he'll think of a song that he would like to hear, so he'll say, play whatever by whoever, and the glasses, we'll just play it. Or sometimes we could be in a store. And you know how they play music in the stores? He can say, hey, may that what song is playing? And it'll Maida will come back and tell him the name and author of whatever song is playing in the store.  00:15:26 Speaker 2  OK, got it. So right now I think it just heard us talking about playing music and even M confirming that he wanted to play music and then it just started playing music. Yes, OK.  00:15:40 Speaker 4  Yes  00:15:40 Speaker 2  Got it. OK.  00:15:40 Speaker 4  Your music off.  00:15:43 Speaker 2  Alright, M can. You try changing a song or giving it another command which which might help us kind of see how it how. It works  00:15:52 Speaker 4  for something specific.  00:15:54 Speaker 3  10 minutes. Played double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:05 Speaker 2  Is that working?  00:16:07 Speaker 3  Yeah 00:16:08 Speaker 4  It just said here's double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:11 Speaker 2  And So what is the default when it comes to playing music? So right now, like M, you did not specify that you're wanting to play on Amazon Music or, you know, something else or Apple music or anything. So how does it just take?  00:16:32 Speaker 2  Any of those uhm, platforms? Or does it ask you?  00:16:37 Speaker 3  Dad, who's double up by Nipsey Hussle from Apple Music.  00:16:42 Speaker 4  So that must be the default. It goes straight to is that Apple music?  00:16:46 Speaker 2  Apple Music, OK make sense 00:16:48 Speaker 4  We do have that in. A play list on your phone and it was already on his phone too.  00:16:53 Speaker 2  Got it, OK, alright, makes sense. M, that's pretty good. Anything else you'd like to? Do you using Gemini especially because I know you were not here during this particular topic training, so I wanted to see. Like if you wanted to generate a story or I. I don't know if you've ever used to generate content like that and if you were interested in doing that with Gemini. So you wanted to like, you know, listen to a story specifically on, you know, your favorite. Animals or like you know, something like like, you know anything it could be or it could be like a day at the beach or, you know, something some of your favorite action movies or something. And you could try using that and see. If you give it a few details, and if it would come up with a story for you.  00:17:57 Speaker 3  OK.  00:17:59 Speaker 2  So you want to tell us what you want to listen to 1st and then maybe once you know that life starts and you can say it.  00:18:07 Speaker 3  Match. Him or her to give me a short story about V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:13 Speaker 2  OK. Yeah.  00:18:18 Speaker 3  Can you create a short story? Short story for me from the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:27 Speaker 5  In a dystopian London, a masked vigilante named V fights against a totalitarian regime. He rescues a young woman named Evie and introduces her to his world of revolution as they work together, Evie learns about these past and his plans to ignite a rebellion against the oppressive government. In the end, these actions inspired the.  00:18:48 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:18:49 Speaker 4  Is that good? Is that?  00:18:50 Speaker 3  Yep.  00:18:51 Speaker 4  What the movie was about.  00:18:52 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:18:53 Speaker 2  Is that is that the only information that came up or was it like very long?  00:18:58 Speaker 4  I have to go back. Just give me a SEC.  00:19:01 Speaker 2  Oh, OK, OK. I was just curious.  00:19:11 Speaker 4  No, it was quite short. If you can see that.  00:19:16 Speaker 2  Yeah. Ohh OK, that's pretty short. Yeah, so. It's like a few sentences, like maybe like 3 to 4 sentences which.  00:19:25 Speaker 4  Yeah, I'd say 3 UM, maybe about 5.  00:19:28 Speaker 2  Five sentences. OK, alright, that's not too bad. It's definitely like much better than like, you know, asking for news that time and it like giving a bunch of information instead of like just, you know, trying to give you the gist of it. And this seems like almost. A gist or the summary of of the of the entire movie or the, you know, just the plot of the movie. Which which makes sense, but that's great. So M, you can always use these AI tools even here. I think your glasses might be a good option when you have a question like that. Or maybe you wanted synopsis. Of a book. Or you know that you'd like to read or a movie or anything. A. A series that you were kind of interested to learn about and it would give you the details about it, you know, so that you could, you could probably decide based on that whether you want to see something or listen to something or and or not, you know.  00:20:27 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:20:27 Speaker 2  Yeah, that would. Be nice. All right, so moving on the the third week or the third session was self-care and medical needs. So we here we discussed topics related to medication management, creating medication lists and finding medications. Searching for self-care tips such as laundry or caring for a loved ones or loved ones or pets, and we asked a bunch of questions about about your pet. The last time. And tips to improve mental and physical health and searching for home remedies if you if you needed something. So now based on these topics, let's find 2 activities again related to self-care and medical needs and then we can practice those. And we'll, we'll base it on which tool or platform to use based on what you want to practice.  00:21:27 Speaker 4  Gemini. OK. And what are you going to ask?  00:21:30 Speaker 3  Right from my head.  00:21:31 Speaker 4  Ohh. Could you say it louder so they can hear you?  00:21:32 Speaker 3  What's that? How do I comb my hair?  00:21:40 Speaker 4  Yeah.  00:21:41 Speaker 3  How do I comb my hair?  00:21:46 Speaker 5  Well, there are a few ways to approach it. You could start by figuring out what kind of style you're going for. Do you want something classic trendy. Or maybe a bit edgy.  00:21:55 Speaker 3  Trendy.  00:21:59 Speaker 5  OK, for something trendy you could try a textured crop with a matte finish. Or if you have longer hair, a messy Cliff might work. Do either of those sound like something? You'd like to try.  00:22:08 Speaker 3  What's a messy quote?  00:22:12 Speaker 5  A messy quiff is a hairstyle that's shorter on the sides and back, but with longer hair on top that's styled upwards and slightly messy, it's a pretty popular. Look right now.  00:22:25 Speaker 5  You're welcome. Do you need help finding a? Good Barber or salon?  00:22:28 Speaker 3  No thanks.  00:22:32 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's great. OK, I wonder that was that was really good back and forth conversation, I think and things that are that are that are that are most amazing I feel and those are the differences between using like like. Versus, you know, Gemini is you know, even if there's hesitations or interruptions, when a command is being presented to to that tool, it still picks up. It doesn't. It's not very quick to say, oh, I did not understand. So the the speech recognition is so much better. You think like that and?It it leads to less frustration.  00:23:17 Speaker 4  And it's more social, yeah.  00:23:19 Speaker 2  Yes, for sure. Definitely more social because it it's asking good follow up questions too, like for example right now with the Barber and you know finding something and just the back and forth it, it feels more human too and less robotic so.  00:23:37 Speaker 4  I. Have. I've noticed that the a device. Is the has slowly getting a little bit more personable as well as, for example, tonight M asked her to set a timer and before she did she said good evening M. I'll set a timer for 10 minutes or whatever. There it was.  00:24:01 Speaker 2  That's good. OK. Yeah. So it's it's definitely it's getting into those greetings and a little bit of personalization based on who's talking to it instead of like just you know generally answering like it would. So yeah, that makes sense. OK, Alright, M, what would be the next? A second task for you related to self-care and medical needs.   00:24:28 Speaker 3  Say, hey, Gemini, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:35 Speaker 4  You want that one, it wants a.  00:24:35 Speaker 3 Yeah. Hey, Gemma, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:45 Speaker 5  OK, here's how to put gel in your hair. Start with a small amount about a pea size drop and rub it between your palms. Apply it evenly, working from the roots to the ends. Style is desired and add more gel if needed.  00:24:57 Speaker 3  Thanks. I'll do that, Gemini. 00:25:03 Speaker 2  That's good. OK.  00:25:04 Speaker 5  OK, work tips on styling it.  00:25:06 Speaker 3  Thank you. I will.  00:25:10 Speaker 2 OK, alright, perfect. OK, so the next one next topic was meal preparation and cooking. Again that one was when on one of the on past Tuesday actually when you were not around. So we can probably practice some of the commands from maybe last year you remember how we talked about making shopping lists. By adding or viewing or listing the items that were on the list on the shopping list and then removing items, we could find recipes or find recipes related to some certain dietary restrictions. Whether it could be gluten free or vegan, or another one of the dietary restrictions that some people might. Have finding nutritional facts about different foods, for example, number of grams of sugar or sodium in a particular food item. Finding calories in some some kind of food. Finding the ingredients for cooking a specific food and then following the recipe. Like instruction by instruction or step by step.So based on all of those ideas, let's find 2 activities related to meal preparation. Before you do, I wanted to ask you, is there particularly anything that has changed from the past year that you've been contributing more towards when it comes to meal preparation, is there, are there things that have changed while you were in the kitchen with your parents or you know, while you were helping them prep?  00:26:53 Speaker 3  Yeah. Well, I came home from the army and they weren't. Me. So that's a big change.  00:27:02 Speaker 4  M, what about when going to Costco? What have you been doing more of? Putting the list on what?  00:27:12 Speaker 3  Hey.  00:27:12 Speaker 4  Yes, he's been making that list for us on and then when we're at, for example, Costco. Because it comes with glasses, he will just say I'll say them. Here's, you know, the strawberries, the bananas, and he'll tell her. Check off strawberries. Check off bananas. That kind of thing.  00:27:33 Speaker 2  OK, so mainly managing making and managing lists for for shopping is something that you do. And I think A is a perfect solution when it comes to something like that or even even the phones assistant S would do a better job, I guess because it would directly put on the notes section and make a list there. So that makes sense. So let do you think you want to try? Making a list or like is there something that you want to add to your shopping list that we could we could practice now? Or is there something else that you would like to do?  00:28:13 Speaker 4  To grab the. M, is it? Do you want to make a? List. Or do you want to get something different?  00:28:17 Speaker 3  Yeah, I would like to make. A list. Should I go to Alexa?  00:28:23 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, you can. I think your mom's just getting Alexa.  00:28:30 Speaker 3  Sure.  00:28:32 Speaker 2  Uh. Your iPad. OK, yeah.  00:28:34 Speaker 4  M's phone is having some major technical difficulties. Ohh on the side has broken off so. We're waiting kind of for his sister to get back so I can change the plan and the phones and everything. One of those things.  00:28:54 Speaker 2  Too many things when there's too so many technologies together at you so.  00:28:59 Speaker 4  You gotta get older. You'll understand my pain.  00:29:03 Speaker 2  No, I don't. I know.  00:29:06 Speaker 4  OK, M, it's ready.  00:29:09 Speaker 3  Yeah, Alexa.Add marshmallows to my Costco list.  00:29:17 Alexa  Marshmallows added to Costco.  00:29:20 Speaker 2  OK. So are you are you, are you managing like multiple lists? Because you said Costco lists. So are there like different lists for different places? That you usually manage.  00:29:34 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:29:36 Speaker 4  What's the other one? Not albertson's.  00:29:39 Speaker 3  Albertsons.  00:29:41 Speaker 2  OK. Makes sense?  00:29:46 Speaker 3  Hey, Alexa. Add cookies to my Albertson's list.  00:29:52 Alexa Cookies added to Albertsons.  00:29:54 Speaker 2  OK. Perfect. That's. That's really good. Anything else that you do with respect to meal preparation when you are in the kitchen with your dad or your mom when while they're cooking or before they're start, they start to cook?  00:30:12 Speaker 3  Hey, Alexa. Add pasta to the Albertson's list.  00:30:19 Alexa  The cost?  00:30:22 Speaker 4  What else do you do though, to help you? M sometimes helps with like cutting or that type of thing.  00:30:28 Speaker 2  Oh, OK. Do you have any questions when you when you have to do anything of that sort related to it?  00:30:37 Speaker 3  No, this guy Cesar, who's my OT specialist, got me some gloves. That are pretty nice.  00:30:44 Speaker 2  OK. All right.  00:30:47 Speaker 4  But M sets a lot of timers as well. For meeting you, set a timer for. The pizza, right?  00:30:57 Speaker 2  Right. Like how much like that would tell you how much, how much time you should boil something for or like just steam something for and just put a timer and then OK. Got it, alright, but but that's pretty good like I think. Managing lists was. Yes. Was definitely great. Do you? Do you have anything else that you would would like to find out? Like finding caloric calories in foods or nutritional facts about any food that you'd like to ask? And maybe we could this time try to use Gemini and see see if that works and how that would work because we've not gotten to practice. This part.  00:31:37 Speaker 3  OK.  00:31:38 Speaker 2  OK. What? What question are you going to ask?  00:31:44 Speaker 3  How much sugar is in the cookies I eat?  00:31:47 Speaker 4  What kind of cookies are you talking about? OK, makes you.  00:31:49 Speaker 3  Symptoms.  00:31:54 Speaker 4  On the tape, OK.  00:31:58 Speaker 3  How much sugar is in the Tim Toms?  00:32:04 Speaker 5  I couldn't find how much sugar is in Tim Tams. You might be able to find that information on the nutrition label on the packaging or on the manufacturer's website.  00:32:12 Speaker 3  OK. Thank you. Hey, Gemini. How much sugar is in the Milo? 00:32:21 Speaker 5  OK, according to the official Milo website, a cup of Milo has about 1 teaspoon of added sugar that's on top of the natural sugars from the milk and malt barley. Does that answer your question?  00:32:31 Speaker 3  Yeah, it does. Thank you.  00:32:33 Speaker 2  OK. So that's good. I mean if it doesn't have an answer to any question, then it will just say that you know it, I don't know about that.  00:32:43 Speaker 4  Yeah. And where to find it?  00:32:45 Speaker 2  Yeah. And where to find it? Yeah, that's that's really good. Alright, so that's the end of our review. Let me stop sharing for a minute and then we'll move on to some of the questions. That we have here.  00:33:05 Speaker 2  OK. Alright, so I'm just going to ask. This was also. The last time that we did the training that we just asked questions about how do you find the training? What kind of problems or challenges you faced and justice sharing about the AI in general and the training satisfaction etc. OK so start M with you and Lauren you can chime in anytime you anytime you think you wanted to contribute so. Because these some of these questions I'm starting with are related to AI satisfaction. So was it difficult or easy for you to use your AI? So Gemini or your glasses for that matter, we're gonna take both into consideration since we've used both through the training and you use those, I think you use your glasses a lot during your day-to-day life so. Tell me about it. How easy or difficult you think?  00:34:07 Speaker 3  We're using at my glass store someone just like Dang. Thank you, Gemini.  00:34:09 Speaker 2  OK. OK. So same with Gemini and and your glasses. It's easy for you to use them, OK?  00:34:20 Speaker 4  The glasses and Gemini pick up where? The a device leaves off base. They all have their place. The truly they truly have their own place, but I can see. There are certain activities 1 is better than the other, but if you can't get the answer on one, you can go to another and that's nice. Having that option, yeah, yeah.  00:34:39 Speaker 2  OK. OK, what specific problems have you faced with Gemini? For example, does it have difficulties understanding your speech or does it have have any difficulties understanding your language or or any sort of navigation issues that you've had? The Gemini.  00:35:08 Speaker 3  There's not really any.  00:35:12 Speaker 4  Actually no. And when we're in the car on Tuesday, we asked a question and it could not understand what we were asking. So we had to rework it. I'm trying to think of what that.Question was.  00:35:28 Speaker 3  Me too.  00:35:31 Speaker 4  It had to do with that boat in Australia we had to. I think it was the way the question was worded the first time. It was unable, it gave information, but it was not accurate. It was about something that happened somewhere else in Australia. But when we added.  00:35:49 Speaker 3  Been on the beach.  00:35:51 Speaker 4  Yes, that's right. When we added Brisbane to it, we're a little bit more specific. It gave a more specific answer.  00:35:59 Speaker 2  OK, makes sense. All right, so that, but when it comes to so you have to sometimes tweak your language and the words to make sure that it gives the information that you're looking for.That makes sense. OK, alright.  How about speech? I think, is there any difficulty? Do you do you feel with with respect to your understanding of speech or? For navigation with Gemini, I think ever since you found the live option, but he could go live on Gemini, I think it's it's really good. I guess the navigation has become much easier.  00:36:42 Speaker 4  Yes, it has. But remember, last week when we were on live, I'll say the question and they couldn't answer that question. Remember, I can't remember what it was for. I can't remember what it was, but we were we asked a question on live and it said you have to go. We don't have the capability yet to.  00:37:01 Speaker 2  Oh oh, I think it was like asking us to link it to Google Workspace or something, and it was about the events.  00:37:10 Speaker 4  Something along the side, yeah.  00:37:12 Speaker 2  Yeah, trying to set up events and and. The same happened. What\u2019s that? 00:37:18 Speaker 4  On the calendar, that's right.  00:37:19 Speaker 2  Calendar. Yes, yes, it it. It kind of told that it would not be able to. Yes that that those kind of questions I guess are tests where it's linked to a certain calendar. If it does not have access to it, it's gonna have a hard time linking it or you know that that's going to be. Only there. So when it comes to reminders or scheduling appointments or any of that I guess. The others are much better. Instead of like using AI and and I think you're already doing that and it's it's that's perfect. You know, whatever is working is working and what we don't want to fix, what's not broken you know so it's that's that's good. All right. So that's good. What do you like most about having Gemini, M?  00:38:10 Speaker 3  He understands me. Well.  00:38:13 Speaker 2  Yeah. So the speech recognition part is very good. It's it's a much, I think it's it's much better when it when compared to last last year's training with Alexa, I guess because you know if there were words or names of movies and people or topics or you know or. Something like a proper noun. And I think it was not correctly pronounced. It would not take that like and it would. You know, we had so much reworking always with the commands that we used to do. So that definitely is is really good. And then what do you dislike the most about having Gemini?  00:38:55 Speaker 4  The good thing too is Gemini allows a bit of a pause, a lot of times. Your follow-up question has to be really quick as Gemini allows a little bit more of a pause, allows a little bit more time for that follow up question actually and it allows a little bit more time than M's glasses. Lows.  00:39:16 Speaker 2  Ohh OK, so that's even a difference between those two AI tools. I mean, and in that case, that's great. OK. Yeah, there's definitely. And sometimes if you if if you talk too quickly after you know the after saying the wake word, it still takes that information. And if sometimes you don't say Gemini and you start just talking when you're alive. It still takes up that information. You don't have to every time say that which which I think is, is this really good when it comes to UM? You know, just normal normalizing like a conversation between two humans, like you don't always say the person's name or something, right? So that that. Makes sense. 00:40:04 Speaker 4   A little bit of a sound because M didn't have to ask. Use, say Gemini tonight at all because it makes a little sound. I don't know if you heard the sound, but it's almost like. Like when you turn on the device. You can hear the sound OK. Like a woosh, so to speak, and so he could hear that and then just go from there.  00:40:25 Speaker 2  Right. So you would know that it's it's on and like you can you can talk now and makes sense. Is there anything that you dislike about Gemini about having Gemini?  Speaker 3 No 00:40:38 Speaker 2  No. OK.  00:40:39 Speaker 4  That's the difference between Gemini and a because a just gives you a blue light and it. Cannot see the blue light. You don't know if it's on. Or not, yes. That's the big difference between them. 00:40:53 Speaker 2  That's a big difference. That's right. What would you change to Gemini to? Make it easier to use. Is there anything?  00:41:03 Speaker 3  Voice recognition.  00:41:07 Speaker 4  Well, but it is recognizing your voice.  00:41:10 Speaker 3  Speech recognition.  00:41:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, I I think that's that's why I think speech and word recognition is pretty good when when you're comparing Gemini to a I guess because it it's definitely doing better. But is there anything that you would change to make it? In any. Other aspect like how? It could be anything else too, and you know it doesn't have to be something.  00:41:39 Speaker 4  And I better.  Speaker 3 Speech resolution 00:41:42 Speaker 4  We're not sure if Gemini goes through M's glasses or not, and so if it doesn't, that would be a definite plus because remember, made us doing their own AI. So I don't know that it would go through the glasses.  00:42:00 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah. Because you know the the glasses allow him to add things to the to a. And like, you know, for the shopping list and things like that. So those two can be synched but. Yeah, I'm not sure that might be something to look into if if those if it would allow Gemini or you know some other like ChatGPT or something. But I believe it would not yeah, because you know how Alexa does not allow S or.  00:42:14 Speaker 4  And. I agree.  00:42:34 Speaker 2  This does not allow a like something because those are the parallels like they are competitors almost. So I guess that would be classes allow Surrey.  00:42:42 Speaker 4  Class. Yes, because the glasses no. You need the phone to work because the glass is paired to the phone. So I think that.  00:42:52 Speaker 2  Yeah. And I think the glasses might be also OK with like a regular Google Assistant, but not like an AI powered. You know what I mean? Because it has its own AI, but that's interesting. Maybe it's it's worth checking. Like, I I don't know whether you know it. It it could just surprise us by having. You know, be having the ability to say.  00:43:15 Speaker 4  The glasses are paired with the be my eyes app that is their accessibility feature for the blind, and so that is one thing that they truly are paired with.  00:43:22 Speaker 2  OK. Right, right. OK, that's that's good to know. OK. All right. So in this training we covered. 4 topics. So we did. News and facts, which is information. Entertainment self-care, medical needs and meal preparation. What topic would you continue to use after this training with, with with Gemini especially and why?  00:43:57 Speaker 3  Meal preparation.  00:44:00 Speaker 2  OK. Is there is there a reason why?  00:44:03 Speaker 3  Because. I think my parents would be. Happy I didn't have no preparation.   Speaker 2 Yeah, that for sure, but.  00:44:15 Speaker 4  Personally, forget about us.  00:44:16 Speaker 3  Entertainment.  00:44:20 Speaker 2  Entertainment.  00:44:21 Speaker 3  Entertainment.  00:44:23 Speaker 2  OK. What, what? What specifically in entertainment would you? Use it for.  00:44:31 Speaker 3  And my favorite songs.  00:44:34 Speaker 2  OK. Anything new? Because you're already doing those things right? Like you are playing songs already. Using your glasses. Is there anything new you would do with with with using Gemini and especially related to entertainment?  00:44:53 Speaker 4  Think about learning. Maybe about more about. The different songs or the different actors or? Different movies. Yeah.  00:45:06 Speaker 2  Well, it just.  00:45:08 Speaker 4  He just said, like, what happened to Hulk Hogan? Because, you know, it's all over the news. Right now, yeah.  00:45:13 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. Yeah. So that that makes sense. So like you would you would want to get more information about those you know those those particular movies or series related to entertainment? And maybe generate like synopsis or you know a little summary of the movie or a book or, you know, yeah, that would, that would be great. Alright. So what are your goal? What were your goals before we started this training and have you met them?  00:45:49 Speaker 4  What's your goal? What was one of your goals? Was it to learn more about Gemini or?  00:45:52 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:45:55 Speaker 4  Have you? Do you feel you've met that goal or?  00:45:56 Speaker 3  Yeah, I think here.  00:46:00 Speaker 4  You think you have.  Speaker 2 OK. Yeah 00:46:02 Speaker 4  We were at the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum. On the weekend, M used his glasses a lot there, you know, what am I looking at? You know, you're looking at an Oscar statue by whatever or, you know, the costume that Ryan seek. Was it was it?  00:46:22 Speaker 3  Brian. OK.  00:46:24 Speaker 4  Ryan, whatever the guy that wore the pink suit with the diamonds for Barbie. Yeah, yeah. Bribed that. So he used the glasses a lot for that. To what am I looking at? And he would just getting information about the different things. At the museum.  00:46:40 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. So that's I I think the glasses are such a good. Tool to have, especially when you are traveling and going places just to get more information and and it's portable enough and you don't have to take your phone out each time to sort of you know get, get, get whatever information you need. So that's perfect so. You've definitely gotten better using AI tools within your class. Glasses and anything else?  00:47:15 Speaker 4  That like in the car on the way back from that museum, we, him and I to ask a question about it, was something related to the museum. I honestly can't remember what it was. A friend of Ms was also in the car. With us and had asked a question about one of the shows or things that we saw there. Is it like when was the movie like Casablanca or something like that? I can't remember. What year? So we asked Gemini, remember distinctly. I don't remember what movie present.  00:47:48 Speaker 2  Yeah. No, no, but that's great. OK. And did you pick? Was that your first choice like that? You wanted to ask Gemini and. OK, alright.  00:47:59 Speaker 4  Gemini rather than Google it, we just asked. Gemini, Gemini.  00:48:02 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. Alright. So M, do you have any suggestions for this training program?  00:48:09 Speaker 3  That's Gemini. What your favorite colors.  00:48:13 Speaker 4  M,  Speaker 3 so great guys.  00:48:17 Speaker 4  Forget the color.  00:48:21 Speaker 2  Anything specific that you have like any suggestions you may have for us, uh or in the for the for the training program or how it should be or anything differently that we should do?  00:48:33 Speaker 3  When is Google gonna let you go? When it's going to let you leave.  00:48:41 Speaker 4  What?  00:48:42 Speaker 3  Good job.  00:48:43 Speaker 4  Ohh I say it, the format that you're doing is very good and that doing the breakout rooms is good. The questions, the slides that you have because. If M could see, he would be able to refer back to the slides. I know I was looking at the slides and you would ask a question. So I think it's a very. Good format. 00:49:06 Speaker 2   OK great. OK.  00:49:08 Speaker 4  Kind of the way that you read it out loud for M, it enables him to participate, so. I think. Yeah, you've made it. You've done the training in a way that maintains. M's interest.  00:49:22 Speaker 2  Ohh for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's really nice to know. Alright so. So do you have any questions or feedback about Geminis responses? UM, anything with the responses that went well and any challenges that you encounter with the responses? But ever since we we started like related to Gemini. Yeah. Any responses that you particularly like and those went wrong versus some things that didn't go well.  00:49:58 Speaker 3  Not that I could think of.  00:50:01 Speaker 4  I think the responses that were more personable kept M's interest and then he would. Ask a follow up question. 00:50:09 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah, 00:50:10 Speaker 4  You could just almost see a conversation going back and. Forth, 00:50:13 Speaker 2  back and forth.  00:50:16 Speaker 4  And if it wasn't as personable or gemini, and I wasn't quite understanding what the question was.  00:50:23 Speaker 3  She basically say what?  00:50:24 Speaker 4  It kind of cut, cut the conversation quickly.  00:50:29 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, that was the good part. Definitely. Like how? Especially with the sugar content that you just asked, like, you know, I did not know the answer and it still gave you a good follow up like you know response that ohh you could check here like you know and instead of like just giving a wig and incorrect answer. So that makes sense. What are some of the challenges that you encountered when asking for responses?  00:51:00 Speaker 3  Speech recognition.  00:51:03 Speaker 4  I would guess not responding quick enough. Like not asked.If you weren't quite sure what you were asking. And you start talking and you're not, and you're trying to come up with the correct answer. Yeah, she loses you.  00:51:21 Speaker 2  OK, OK.  00:51:22 Speaker 4  A little bit quicker.  00:51:24 Speaker 2  Be a little bit quicker in terms of responses, OK. Anything else that you can think of when it comes to challenges?  00:51:37 Speaker 3  He understands very much time, but not all the time.  00:51:40 Speaker 2  OK. All right. Can you give me an example of when? She doesn't understand.  00:51:48 Speaker 3  When she doesn\u2019t? 00:51:49 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:51:52 Speaker 4  Did you when you mumble a little bit?  00:51:53 Speaker 3  Now remember, a little bit should be like what did you say?  00:51:56 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:51:58 Speaker 3  I'll clear my my throat and say I said this, that or the third.  00:52:04 Speaker 2  OK. All right. That makes sense. OK. Another this is my personal thing, but I think when we first started. And we did the. Participatory design, especially when we were talking about all the responses, M and you know how you asked about the conflict between Israel and Iran. And it just sort of gave you like so much information at once and that was the thing with all the different AI tools that we tried that day. It was so much more descriptive. So.  00:52:46 Speaker 1  Hi. Claire, are we done with M?  00:52:53 Speaker 6  No, we're still on 3.1.  00:52:55 Speaker 1  Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.  00:52:56 Speaker 6  Yeah. No, you're good. Are you? Yeah.  00:52:59 Speaker 1  Hey, we just want to say bye to M and then we'll probably let her go. Yeah, because we finished early. Sorry about that. OK. Let's see. R, I may just ask you to share with Claire and Peter like one quick comment and then maybe we don't get enough time to show M. If you want to show, show them stuff you work on today as a final. Ohh there. There's. Hi. Sorry for interrupting. I know you 2 are still going. R. Want to say hi before our summer program ends, so I just figured R will show something, and then we'll let you go back to the room again. Yes, interrupting.  00:53:49 Speaker 6  Oh yeah, I was just gonna. I was using Geminni for. They to health they personal health.Like. Like things to do to, like, calm yourself down. So it's like. Like calming yourself, doing music and going outside. And just like she would give me a list of things to do and just doing creative and doing self-care. And I is music soothing does like using Geminis give you these little prompts so you can find. Find they calm or just being. You could see their mind through things like journaling and aromatherapy and just. It's even just petting them or just listening to music and writing it down, so it's like. Do you ever name is the platform I can get all these. It's just like a short list of things you just care for yourself, like doing exercise or like if she wants you. Ohh you can do some aromatherapy and just she just gives you a list of things you can back yourself up with a self-care.  00:55:00 Speaker 4  R is sharing the list of things that Gemini I told her, and she shared her screen showing the different suggestions that Gemini gave her.  00:55:10 Speaker 3  OK. That's nice. Yeah. Share your screen, R.  00:55:15 Speaker 1  And do you want to read maybe one or think one or two things that you may do this summer so M can know your summer rest of your summer plan?  00:55:26 Speaker 6  Ohh like you know. Like like end of next weekend, like coming next couple weeks. You U.S. Open of surfing is in Huntington and we're using temerity to like find parking and they're looking for survey competitions cause we asked asked her about like when will. Like the longboard surf surfing contests happen cause I like surfing longboard cause. I was like, want to watch that cause I'm not that really that great. But I just like watching. So just using Gemini to like give me information about things I like to watch. Just just to for my own summer plans. Yeah.  00:56:11 Speaker 3  Thank you for the information, R.  00:56:14 Speaker 1  M, do you have anything you want to tell R before we let her Go.  00:56:18 Speaker 4  Tell her, UM, what? We asked. Gemini will move in the car. Coming back from the beach.  00:56:24 Speaker 3  Yes, we ask Gemini, we ask Gemini, where we were.  00:56:29 Speaker 4  About the boat in Australia.  00:56:30 Speaker 3  About the boat in Australia. Is it boat that crashed? It crashed on Rainbow Beach and my boss told us about Rainbow Beach because he was from Australia. And the ship crashed in the 80s and the 70s.  00:56:47 Speaker 6  Oh.  00:56:47 Speaker 4  And so Gemini gave an obscure fact that we fall from the 70s when his father lived in Australia.  00:56:56 Speaker 6  It's like, yeah, like a family connection, but it's like. Pam is sometimes history is. Feel you feel like. Some kind of connection, yeah.  00:57:09 Speaker 4  His dad had told him a story and M verified the story with Gemini.  00:57:14 Speaker 6  Using it, it's kinda it's like this really happened. Like OK is it? Gemini knows. Yeah, it was there. So it's like backing information to what your dad told you. She it was a real thing. So you should have my. It's like another. Like another perspective for us, like using our life, yeah.  00:57:36 Speaker 4  Yeah, that's right.  00:57:38 Speaker 1  Thank you so much for sharing M and prayer let you folks go back into. Your room, OK. Yeah. And Kelly and Larry and Arisha and R, you are free to go. Having summer will stay in. Touch.  00:57:50 Speaker 2  Alright, OK.  00:57:52 Speaker 6  OK. Bye bye.  00:57:54 Speaker 1  Everybody had a good summer.  00:57:59 Speaker 3  Thank you you guys too.  00:58:18 Speaker 2  Oh. Oh, Claire's here. That's fine. OK. Alright. So. Oh, yeah. Sorry. M\u2019s momo, I think we were talking about. Wait one SEC. There we go. OK. Yeah. From your perspective, how can we make the AI responses more relevant to? You. That's that's the question you were Discussing 00:58:42 Speaker 4   right and. I remember we were just talking about it and then it. Went off.  00:58:49 Speaker 2  I know, I know. UM.  00:58:57 Speaker 4  To make the AI more relevant. Well, I think Jim and I picks up where maybe the glasses lets off or Alexa lets where the different devices stop. Gemini picks up and it gives. And another opportunity like if you can't get the answer from your phone on just because from my era and I I was new to Google, we would just start Googling everything and now it's almost as if you don't need to Google anymore, you can just. Ask Jim and I and you'll get an instant response. And for M, who grew up with all of the technology. It's so easy for him just to ask his glasses or because he's wearing them most times and he will say. Well, I need my glasses to see and so cause it tells him the information that he needs more so than just asking the phone anymore. If the glasses isn't giving the answer quick enough, he can ask Gemini.  01:00:07 Speaker 2  Yes. OK. So like different tools will give different kind of responses and there were one thought if one thought short something there's another platform to pick up and and try that for asking that particular question. OK. That makes sense. Alright, so any any command examples that you can specifically share when it comes to you know how 11 platform will let let off and then you know some some other platform would pick up. Is there a specific example?  01:00:46 Speaker 4  Think of is the calendar if you ask. On. S on the phone? Yeah. What am I doing today or what's on my calendar? Yeah, might say. Ohh. You have 3 events today.  01:01:01 Speaker 2  MHM.  01:01:02 Speaker 4  And you can say what are the events you have 3 events today, whereas if you ask Alexa, she was. If you have 3 events today at 8:00 you are going to the brain and at 10:00 you have a dental appointment. It will give, it will literally read your calendar to you.  01:01:09 Speaker 2  Correct. 01:01:21 Speaker 4   And then the downfall is Gemini won't go into your calendar unless they have access.  01:01:27 Speaker 2  Yeah. Can you think of something other way around where where AI or Gemini where and the glasses would pick up and and wear Alexa or S would not respond to or not respond appropriately? Are there any topics or or examples like that?  01:01:58 Speaker 4  Well. With the glasses, M can. He's really good. Like with playing a lot of his music and then asking questions about the author who wrote the song, or when did it come out or. Yeah, play something similar to it and it's all linked to his.To the Apple music, right, and which is on this phone whereas. The A Alexa is more linked to. Amazon Music.  01:02:30 Speaker 2  Right.  01:02:35 Speaker 4  And I would guess he we haven't done it, but actually we kind of did it in a roundabout way, asking Jim and I about certain things related to that song. You could get it, and especially like if the if the song is from a movie, for example, when we were at the museum. In Los Angeles last weekend, he could have said what is the theme song from Casablanca? That type of thing, and he would have gotten that from Jim and I and probably got more information from Gemini than from his bosses.  01:03:06 Speaker 2  Got it. OK. OK. Alright. Makes sense. So we're interested in designing the AI response to be more interactive. So imagine like a virtual clinician for you to help you with your needs. So when this training is not on, say you need it. You know, any any anything that you need, like a virtual clinician for what kinds of help would you like to receive from this kind of agent?  01:03:39 Speaker 4  Well, I think what M did tonight when we were doing those examples with his hair, yes. And he asked, like, how do I comb my hair? Because that's one thing. And he asked, I give. I've done my hair properly. Yeah. And he asked that follow up question how do I apply the type of guy and then the hair gel. That was all very relevant. To a 25 year old.  01:04:01 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  01:04:02 Speaker 4  And so I think that was very appropriate. I could see the virtual. I mean they worked with Gemini in doing that, right,  Speaker 2 right, right .  01:04:16 Speaker 4  And More so, like, stuff like that.  01:04:20 Speaker 4 How do I and I would guess you could even say something like how do I brush my teeth to make sure I clean? Them all or .   01:04:28 Speaker 2  yeahYeah. So would you say that when it comes to like a virtual agent or a virtual clinician, it would be more of providing ideas of what kind of questions and what kind of content he could ask for so that the? He could use the platforms or the tools to the fullest. Of its ability.  01:04:51 Speaker 4  I think so, yeah. Because I think the biggest difference is M has a TBI and so. And me being older and so I'm having to try to figure it out. Compared to someone like Peter, for example, who is closer in age to M, who doesn't have a TBI, I'm sure he just can come up with stuff like. This whereas M starting to get back to that type of way, whereas me it's a whole new learning experience.  01:05:24 Speaker 2  Right. Correct, correct. OK, alright. That makes so much sense. Thank you for sharing that. OK so. UM, what information do you want to share with this kind of virtual agent, or what information do you want the agent to learn so that it could help you with the homework or with the training of the of this training?  01:05:54 Speaker 4  I think the more you use the AI, the more the AI learns about you. So, for instance, with M's glasses, he can ask a question like.  01:06:07 Speaker 3  I'm blind.  01:06:08 Speaker 4  Hey Maida, what am I looking at? And Maida will give a description. And M can say remember Mata, I'm blind and my Maida will then give a more comprehensive description as yeah, he's looking at. And so the AI responds to that. When you say, remember, I'm blind or I am blind. What am I looking at? Yeah, I am blind. Is it safe to cross the street?That's not a good example because they won't. No AI will tell you it's safe to cross the street. That's a safety issue, but it might say, are there any cars in the vicinity? Yes. She's fine.  01:06:50 Speaker 3  See.  01:06:50 Speaker 4  Yeah, she's right there. She's OK. She was asking about the dog, but I think. Yeah. So no way I will tell you. Yes, you can cross the street, but they can tell you if you stay on. Remember, I'm blind. What is on the sign above me? It will read the sign more detail. 01:07:08 Speaker 2  Yeah. And it's almost like it. You want to learn your own history and your own like to remember the facts about about yourself and and then respond appropriately, you know.  01:07:26 Speaker 4  Yes, definitely. M saying the dog.  01:07:28 Speaker 2  Up. Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, I'm almost. I I should be done. I guess so.  01:07:34 Speaker 4  It's just.  01:07:38 Speaker 2  What what would be ideal interaction between between M and the agent? So a a virtual agent like that who would be helping with, you know, maintaining their learnings from this kind of training?  01:07:55 Speaker 4  Ohh, I noticed that when M uses Gemini. He would say things like thank you and Gemini responds back. You're welcome, that type of thing and it's more conversational and and even with follow up questions on both ways, whether it's from M or from the agent when they were asking about. The weather in Africa. And M said, well, how's about in, you know, Tanzania? He went to the different places assistant, and then she, he said thank you. She said you're welcome that makes a. Difference I think because it's just part of a typical conversation, because even with Alexa, he'll say, oh, thank you, Alexa. And there's no response. Siri responds back. But. Does Maida respond back to you, Maida?  01:08:47 Speaker 3  Nope.  01:08:48 Speaker 2  Doesn't does not OK.  01:08:51 Speaker 4  Sorry does but Alexa and the glasses don't say, oh, you're. Welcome. 01:08:55 Speaker 2  Yeah. And I think the other difference when he was asking about the weather, he he asked, what's the weather in, you know, Tanzania and then? For for the other two locations, he did not see. The whole question. It was like, how about in, you know, Uganda? Or how about in Kenya? So it doesn't even like it remembers like it contextually remembers what the context was and what he was asking. In the question. Previously and then kind of repeats and makes up the context on its own which which which is different from how a? Or S would be in this. Given situation.  01:09:36 Speaker 4  And with the person with the TBI. That's a lot easier because having to remember a big long prompt, yeah, a lot different than being able to have it, more like a conversation.  01:09:49 Speaker 2  Exactly. Yes. All right. Well, that that really that this it actually. Yeah. Is there anything else you would like to share with us?  Speaker 3 Nope Speaker 2 He's he's like I'm done. Can you can you just, like, be done now? I'm. I'm just so done right, M.  01:10:08 Speaker 1  M, I just want to say thank you so much for another great summer. You taught us so much about AI.  01:10:14 Speaker 2  I feel yes the same way I think and you've done so well since the past year. I think I see huge, huge. I mean I think gains in your skills and your language and your speech especially I think it's. It's really wonderful.  01:10:31 Speaker 4  What do you say, M?  01:10:32 Speaker 3  Thank you.  01:10:35 Speaker 1  And thank you so much for everything you're doing to support her mom. And we cannot do this without you every summer. And we love seeing you all making really great explorations and trying out new things with us and learning from these new available free tools. And yeah, it's been great. Summer. Is there anything like I'll. I'll follow up on the gift card. Got your e-mail and they'll probably do it in waves. And is there anything else you'd like us to follow up with or if you're interested in maybe doing more of the lessons in the fall and spring semester we're planning and thinking about that because we have a few people on the.  01:11:16 Speaker 4  Just in mind, because we're learning a lot from it as well. I mean, truthfully, Alexa has been a godsend for M because it's making him more independent. All of these different technologies and the AI, it is helping M become more independent and it's helping us. It's kind of. Think outside the box as well, and that's been wonderful. So we've truly appreciate. Every time you've offered to us, we really do.  01:11:44 Speaker 1  Thank you. M, we're all done. We'll let you go eat your dinner. Thank you so much for being very patient. With us, bye.  01:11:52 Speaker 4  Thank you so much. We appreciate all your help. Thank you. Bye bye.        \nWEBVTT   00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:13.963 Thank you. All right. Um, so Michael, tell me how\u2026 how is it going? Have you tried using Gemini at all? Like, this.  00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:19.784 Past week\u2026 Yeah.  00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.442 Yeah. Me and my mom are on the beach on Tuesday.  00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:25.522 And she asked me to use Gemini to find out what we were looking at.  00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.359 Sorry, where were you at? Did you go somewhere, you said?  00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:31.973 And I asked Gemini what we were looking at.  00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.945 Oh, okay. Oh, that was\u2026 that was the week before, is that correct?  00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970 Alessio Beach.  00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.465 Yeah. As well as this week.  00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360 I'm still on summer break for a week, so we've been going to the beach at least weekly.  00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.951 Oh, this week too, okay, okay. So that was new, um\u2026  00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:57.477 That's nice. Okay, okay, I got it. Um, so then\u2026 Um, how was it different from the first time?  00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:08.154 Ask Gemini to tell me what we're looking at. And we're on live. She said it looks like you guys are at the beach.  00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:13.396 And then\u2026 You said\u2026 do you guys\u2026 are you guys having fun?  00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:20.021 I said, yeah. She asked if we're having fun the first week that we asked her.  00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.770 Okay. Okay, okay.  00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:26.844 She did not ask that the second week. Did say it looks like you're at the beach.  00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.840 Got it, okay. Did it say anything about the weather, or what's in the environment, or\u2026 nothing, just about\u2026 just that.  00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.750 We were\u2026  00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710 You are at the beach, that's all.  00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:57.963 Yeah, and it also, like, it picked up, um\u2026 the legs, uh, I think it picked up Michael's legs, because he was holding the phone, and so it said it in the four\u2026 ground, it shows the, um, feet or legs, something along those lines, as well.  00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150 Uh-huh.  00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:02.216 And also, it\u2026 it took in the whole view of what it seemed.  00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.014 Got it.  00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.829 We were trying to compare it, or I was trying to compare it to an app called Be My Eyes.  00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.141 Mmm\u2026  00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.740 Which is, um\u2026 amount that the blind community uses.  00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:15.674 Okay.  00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:21.389 Okay? Uh-huh.  00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790 And you can hold up your phone with be my eyes on it.  00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:33.660 Or you can use it through your glasses. And it will be my eyes is where you can call a\u2026 volunteer, and they will describe what's going on around you. So it's a good person.  00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:37.811 So, I was just trying to compare it to different things on the phone.  00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:37.664 What's going on? Okay.  00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:57.583 Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting, okay. All right, okay. So, would you say that that was a better fit when you wanted to\u2026 sort of see something, um, or ask\u2026 about information about any picture or anything that's, like, live in front of him?  00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:02.644 I'd say live is really good, to be honest with you.  00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:07.503 Um, the other thing we used it for, remember in the car when we were driving?  00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.085 Okay.  00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:16.089 Michael's dad is from Australia. He was telling Michael a story about a ship.  00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:16.942 Oh?  00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:20.672 That was a boat that was shipwrecked in, like, the 70s.  00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:30.241 And so, we asked Gemini. What boat was shipwrecked in Brisbane, Australia in the 70s?  00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.802 Okay.  00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:38.627 And within seconds. It came back with the name and blah blah blah, and my husband's going, that's exactly right.  00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:44.204 And it was some obscure thing that happened in the 70s.  00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.729 Oh, okay.  00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.069 Great. Yeah, yeah, so it's really digging information from.  00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.280 That really didn't make worldwide news.  00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:59.934 Like, even the\u2026 so much, so many years back, so which is\u2026 which is great. And it's a\u2026 and the good part is that it was accurate.  00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:08.849 Yes. And it was\u2026 it was\u2026 it was for an obscure fact. It wasn't\u2026 you know, like, when was World War II?  00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.776 Yeah.  00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:14.285 Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, nice, that's\u2026 that's very good to know. Okay, I'm gonna share my screen.  00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:26.526 So, we can, um\u2026 get on with this. Um, so this is going to be a little different from last year. We're just gonna do a final review.  00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:39.654 Where, um, so we're just gonna review each week's learnings, and then\u2026 Um, I'll provide you with, like, an open-ended prompt for any, like, that particular topic of the week.  00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:54.649 And then we'll, um\u2026 both of us together, Michael, or even Mom, uh, we can come up with, um, two voice commands per topic and practice those using either Alexa, Gemini, or even for you, your glasses.  00:04:54.925 --> 00:05:02.925 Whichever is the best fit. Um\u2026 based on the command that you want to, or the activity that you want to practice.  00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:17.924 Okay? Alright, so\u2026 Um\u2026 So, let's see where we\u2026 we start here. Um, so this is information seeking. That was the first topic that we discussed.  00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:09.137 Okay.  00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:25.391 And, um, the topics that were covered during that week was about asking about the weather.  00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:35.542 Making and, uh, deleting to-do lists. Um, adding events to a calendar, local, uh, asking about local and international news.  00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:43.551 Um, and information related to sporting events, or any kind of other information that you're curious about, you could ask.  00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:47.508 Those are sort of, like, the broad topics that we covered.  00:05:47.575 --> 00:06:00.575 For information seeking that week. So, let's find two tasks that you would like to, um\u2026 practice related to information seeking, and practice those using either Gemini.  00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:07.528 Um, your glasses or Alexa. So, let's see, what you pick, and then we'll decide based on that.  00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:14.677 What would you like to do, Michael? When's it gonna rain next?  00:06:11.664 --> 00:06:13.664 If that makes sense.  00:06:14.344 --> 00:06:21.344 Okay, so to ask about the weather, which, um\u2026 What platform do you think would be better? Gemini.  00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.611 Gemini? Okay, just let me open my phone.  00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:40.977 Are you asking about the weather, um, in your area, or is there somewhere you're going, or you're curious about?  00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.630 Local, or do you want to find out where your sister's at?  00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:54.714 State weather. Okay. Okay, um\u2026 go like this, I'll turn the volume up high so she can hear.  00:06:55.135 --> 00:07:02.135 Okay, you ready? Yeah. Hey, Gemini. What is the local state weather?  00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:10.995 In state, it's 83 and sunny. Today, it'll be sunny, with a high of 86 and a low of 60.  00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:18.658 Is it gonna rain soon? Currently, there's no chance of rain.  00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:26.851 Does that make sense?  00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:29.842 Okay, very good.  00:07:29.356 --> 00:07:38.356 That's perfect, okay. All right. What did you, um\u2026 Is that very\u2026 where your sister lives, or what did you say?  00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.319 You'd like to know if it's going\u2026  00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:44.075 Now, I asked, um, if Micah wanted to ask where his sister is, because his sister is in Africa right now.  00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:55.414 Oh, okay. Oh, okay, okay, got it, got it. Okay, that was really good, Michael. I think you did a great job, and I think it picked up.  00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.882 So, if you want to ask about the weather, where she's at.  00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:07.700 Your, um, command really easily, and it provides\u2026 it seems like it provided the, uh, appropriate, uh, weather conditions and everything, and\u2026 Also, chances of rain, so that's\u2026 that's great.  00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:11.404 Good job asking a follow-up question, Michael, that was very good.  00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:22.272 Yeah. All right, let's find another task that\u2026 or another task or activity related to information seeking that you'd like to ask.  00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:30.996 You know what you want to ask? Yeah, Gemini, what's your favorite color? No, no, no, let's not do favorite color, let's think information setting.  00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:38.595 There's something in the world, something global, something\u2026 else. Hey, Gemini, what's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:45.512 Nope, it's capped the phone.  00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:52.553 In Gemini, what's the weather like in Africa? Africa's a big place, so the weather varies a lot.  00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:56.397 It could be hot and dry in the Sahara, or warm and humid in the Congo.  00:08:55.961 --> 00:09:00.961 Do you have a specific country or city in mind? Tanzania.  00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:08.254 Okay, in Tanzania, it's currently 71 degrees and partly cloudy. It's going to be mostly sunny.  00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:11.556 With a high of 82 and a low of 69 degrees.  00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.789 About Kenya.  00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.800 Okay, in Nairobi, Kenya, it's currently 55 degrees and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 77 degrees.  00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:29.612 And the low is 54 degrees. In Uganda?  00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:39.867 Okay, in Kampala, Uganda, it's currently 64 degrees and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 81 degrees.  00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:46.762 And the low is 63 degrees. Hi, is anyone who's above 64?  00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:51.214 Those are the three places his sister is going to be.  00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:49.397 That's great.  00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:56.810 Okay, that makes sense, okay, way to go, like, with asking all those follow-ups, Michael, again.  00:09:56.276 --> 00:10:20.276 Great job. Okay, so that\u2026 I think the live is working much better, um, when\u2026 whenever he's using Gemini. I guess when\u2026 in the first session, when we were trying to do the weather-related questions, it was\u2026 It was not taking the place, remember the location, and then we had to sort of say the location.  00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:03.795 Thank you.  00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:26.029 I think doing live makes. Like, I think it\u2026 it catches the location.  00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:34.205 I agree, and I think live for Michael especially, is a lot easier.  00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.689 On its own, or some\u2026 yeah.  00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:41.090 Because when you're not on live. You have to touch the button at the bottom.  00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.042 Mm-hmm.  00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:48.651 For the microphone, and then\u2026 If you want to stop, you have to find the stop button at the top of the phone.  00:10:45.503 --> 00:10:47.503 Yeah.  00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:56.225 And when you use VoiceOver, you can do that, but you have to go through a\u2026 it will read every single section.  00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:03.565 Live, you just touch the screen anywhere, and away you go. Touch the screen again, and it stops.  00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:01.361 Yeah. Right.  00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:12.886 Yeah, that's\u2026 that is really good. I think, um, yeah, I'm glad we found that, and found it really quick early on in the training, so that has helped a lot, I feel.  00:11:16.874 --> 00:11:23.874 And Michael can also ask S\u2026 You know, who asks this? To open up that app.  00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.390 Alright, um, so we'll move on. All right.  00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:26.299 Yeah. Okay.  00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.216 And then go to live, and it will just do it.  00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:32.454 Okay, alright, so that's even better, because if no one's around.  00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:36.088 You\u2026 he could always do that, right, Michael? Like, you can ask.  00:11:36.514 --> 00:11:45.514 Your phone\u2026 phone's assistant. Starting with us, and just say that open\u2026 or, like, start live on\u2026 on Gemini or something.  00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:45.301 Yeah.  00:11:46.189 --> 00:12:00.189 Okay. Alright. Okay, so Michael, the next topic we, um, we talked about was entertainment. Um, this was, I think, on one of the Tuesdays that you were not, um, not here, and you were at your therapy session.  00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.123 Yeah.  00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:14.426 So, from last year, you might remember that we talked about the different topics under entertainment. Um, it was related to searching information, related to media, listening to music, watching movies.  00:12:14.343 --> 00:12:24.343 Um, with Gemini and AI tools, you can also generate stories and generate any content, like, generate new content and new stories.  00:12:24.362 --> 00:12:32.362 Um, and you can also, um, tell jokes, um, and play trivia games like you were able to on Alexa.  00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:39.510 So, um, if you were to do two tasks related to entertainment, what would you pick.  00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:49.473 Vendetta, the movie?  00:12:45.762 --> 00:12:54.762 Okay. Alright, so, um, and what would you\u2026 which platform would you use? Which tool you would use for that?  00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:05.997 It could be your glasses, or Gemini, or even Alexa, or your phone's assistant.  00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:14.116 On us, Gemini. A Gemini, who made the VFA Vendetta movie?  00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:13.441 Okay, alright, let's try.  00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:24.271 B for Vendetta was directed by James McTeague, but the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis, who are famous for the Matrix movies.  00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:32.291 Is that correct, Michael? Okay. All right.  00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:37.776 Yeah. Michael, what do you use on a\u2026 multiple times during the day.  00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:46.716 With your glasses, what do you ask your glasses? No, you don't. What do you do multiple times? And I have to ask you to please stop.  00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:51.879 Timer? No. Play. Play games. No.  00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.500 Play your\u2026 Music. Play his music. Multiple times.  00:13:59.164 --> 00:14:05.164 He uses his glasses a lot to play his music, because it will play music from.  00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:04.972 Okay.  00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:10.738 Apple Music. Apple Music, or from Amazon. It'll\u2026 he has to tell it.  00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:24.661 Okay, alright. Do you want to try using one of those commands and see, um\u2026 so when you, when you use that command, does it\u2026 That will directly come via your earphones of the\u2026 of your glasses, correct?  00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.555 And\u2026  00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:33.879 Okay. Alright, we can try that. That works. Okay? Whenever you're ready.  00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:30.662 Yeah. Yeah.  00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:41.563 What do you want to listen to? It's on my phone. Okay.  00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.290 And whatever music you want to play.  00:14:45.962 --> 00:14:50.962 Can you say the command? Is it playing the music automatically? Yeah.  00:14:55.403 --> 00:14:57.403 It's playing the music automatically.  00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:06.889 Playing, sometimes Michael will say, um. He'll think of a song that he would like to hear, so he'll say, play whatever by whoever.  00:14:58.055 --> 00:15:00.055 Okay, so without even\u2026  00:15:06.803 --> 00:15:12.803 And the glasses will just play it. Or sometimes we could be in a store.  00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:12.805 Yeah.  00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:19.325 And you know how they play music in the stores? He can say, hey, Maida, what song is playing?  00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:25.930 And it made it will come back and tell him the name and author of whatever song is playing in the store.  00:15:23.468 --> 00:15:25.468 Mm-hmm.  00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:38.825 Okay, got it. So right now, I think it just heard us talking about playing music, and\u2026 Even Michael confirming that he wanted to play music, and then it just started playing music.  00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:52.976 Okay, got it. Alright, Michael, can you try changing a song or, um, giving it another command, which might help us kind of see how it works?  00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.735 Yes. Turn your music off on.  00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:58.223 Ask for something specific. Played double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:09.445 Is it working? Okay.  00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.519 Yeah. Here's\u2026 it just said, here's double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:11.528 --> 00:16:19.528 And so, what is the default when it comes to playing music? So, right now, like.  00:16:19.494 --> 00:16:36.494 Michael, you did not specify. That you're wanting to play on Amazon Music or, um, you know, something else, or Apple Music or anything. So how\u2026 Does it just take\u2026 any of those, um, platforms, or does it ask you?  00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:42.044 That there's double up on Nipsey Hussle. From Apple Music.  00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:47.264 So that must be the default, it goes straight to his Apple Music.  00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:47.882 Okay.  00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:50.669 Apple Music, okay. Makes sense.  00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:53.846 Did you put that in a playlist on your phone? Oh, and it was already on his phone, too.  00:16:54.572 --> 00:17:10.572 Got it, okay, great, makes sense. Alright, Michael, that's pretty good. Um, anything else you'd like to, um\u2026 do using Gemini especially, because I know you were not here during this particular, um.  00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:26.825 Topic training, so I wanted to see, um\u2026 like, you know, if you wanted to generate a story, or\u2026 I don't know if you've ever used to generate content like that, um\u2026 And if you were interested in doing that with Gemini.  00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:21.251 You know.  00:17:26.022 --> 00:17:31.022 Say you wanted to, like, you know, listen to a story.  00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:48.518 Specifically on, you know, um, your favorite animals, or, like, you know, something like\u2026 like, you know, anything it could be, or it could be, like, a day at the beach, or, you know, something\u2026 some of your favorite action movies or something.  00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:56.539 You could try using that and see if\u2026 Um, you give it a few details, and if it would come up with a story.  00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:06.675 For you. So, you want to tell us what you want to listen to first, and then maybe once, you know, that life starts and you can say it?  00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.548 Okay.  00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:12.679 I'm not\u2026 I can\u2026 or her to\u2026 Give me a short story about the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:19.604 Okay, yeah.  00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:25.549 Can you create a short story? Uh\u2026 short story for\u2026 For me, from the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:27.682 --> 00:18:33.682 In a dystopian London, a masked vigilante named V fights against a totalitarian regime.  00:18:33.797 --> 00:18:37.797 He rescues a young woman named Evie, and introduces her to his world of revolution.  00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:43.069 As they work together, Evie learns about V's past, and his plans to ignite a rebellion against the oppressive government.  00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:48.709 In the end, V's actions inspired the people. Thanks, Bill.  00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:52.868 Is that good? Yep. Is that what the movie was about? Yep.  00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:54.175 Yeah?  00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:58.054 Is that\u2026 is that the only information that came up, or was it, like, very long?  00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:05.397 I have to go back, just give me a sec.  00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:08.026 Oh. Oh, okay, okay. I was just curious.  00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:17.712 No, it was quite short. If you can\u2026 See that?  00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:27.939 Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay, that's pretty short, yeah. So it's like a few sentences, like, maybe, like, 3 to 4 sentences, which\u2026  00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:37.178 5 sentences, okay, alright. That's not too bad, it's definitely, like\u2026 much better than, like, you know, asking for news that time.  00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:32.659 Yep, I'd say 3, um, maybe about 5.  00:19:37.373 --> 00:19:52.373 And it, like, giving a bunch of information instead of, like, just\u2026 you know, trying to give you the gist of it, and this seems like almost\u2026 or just\u2026 or the summary of the entire movie, or the, you know, just the plot of the movie.  00:20:26.383 --> 00:20:38.383 You know? Yeah, that would be nice. Alright, so\u2026 Moving on, um, the third week, or the third session, was, um, self-care and medical needs.  00:20:31.252 --> 00:20:33.252 Yeah.  00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:44.486 So, uh, we\u2026 here we discussed, uh, topics related to medication management.  00:20:44.449 --> 00:20:54.449 Creating medication lists and finding medications. Um, searching for self-care tips, such as laundry or caring for a loved one or.  00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:58.178 And we asked a bunch of questions about your pet the last time.  00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:04.410 Um, and tips to improve mental and physical health, and searching for home remedies if you.  00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:12.798 Um, if you needed something. So, now, based on these topics, let's, um, find two activities again.  00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:23.810 Uh, related to self-care and medical needs, and then, um, we can practice those, and we'll base it on which, um, tool or platform to use, based on what you want to.  00:21:27.226 --> 00:21:32.226 Gemini? Okay, and what are you going to ask? And right from my head. Oh!  00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:29.766 Practice.  00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:38.175 What's that? Okay, alright.  00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.940 Could you say it louder so that I can hear it? Oh, I don't want to hear.  00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.400 How do I comb my hair?  00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:51.599 Well, there are a few ways to approach it. You could start by figuring out what kind of style you're going for.  00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:55.101 Do you want something classic, trendy, or maybe a bit edgy?  00:21:55.231 --> 00:22:05.231 Trendy. Okay, for something trendy, you could try a textured crop with a matte finish. Or, if you have longer hair.  00:22:05.238 --> 00:22:10.238 A messy quiff might work. Do either of those sound like something you'd like to try? What's a messy quiff?  00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:19.147 A messy quiff is a hairstyle that's shorter on the sides and back, but with longer hair on top that's styled upwards and slightly messy.  00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:25.238 It's a pretty popular look right now.  00:22:25.732 --> 00:22:29.732 You're welcome. Do you need help finding a good barber or salon? No, thanks.  00:22:32.524 --> 00:22:50.524 That is great! I wonder, um, that was\u2026 that was really good back-and-forth conversation, I think, and, um, things that I\u2026 that are\u2026 that are most amazing, I feel, and those are the differences between using, like, a.  00:22:50.728 --> 00:23:02.728 Alexa or Siri, versus, um, you know, Gemini, is, you know, even if there is hesitations or interruptions, uh, when a command is being presented.  00:23:02.535 --> 00:23:16.535 To that tool, it still picks up. Um, it doesn't\u2026 it's not very quick to say, oh, I did not understand. So the, um, the speech recognition is so much better, I think, like, that\u2026 and it leads to less frustration.  00:23:16.623 --> 00:23:21.623 Um. Yes, for sure.  00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:23.671 Great, and it's more social.  00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:34.959 Definitely more social, because it's asking good follow-up questions, too. Um, like, for example, right now, with the barber and, you know, finding something, and, um, just the back and forth, it feels more human, too.  00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:44.209 Um, and less robotic. So\u2026 Yeah.  00:23:37.094 --> 00:23:42.094 I have\u2026 I've noticed that\u2026 Um, the A device.  00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:47.991 Is the\u2026 is slowly getting a little bit more personable as well.  00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:56.568 Because, for example, tonight, um, Michael asked her to set a timer, and before she did, she said, good evening, Mike.  00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:54.034 Hmm\u2026  00:23:57.938 --> 00:24:00.938 Um, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes, or whatever it was.  00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:02.149 Oh.  00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:10.010 That's good, okay. Yeah, so it's definitely\u2026 it's getting into those greetings and a little bit of personalization.  00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:17.552 Based on who's talking to it, instead of, like, just. You know, generally answering like it would. So, yeah.  00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:25.740 That makes sense. Okay. Alright, Michael, what would be the next, uh, second task for you, uh, related to self-care and medical needs?  00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:32.102 Say, hey, Gemini, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:39.993 --> 00:24:41.993 Not that one? Yeah. Okay, one sec.  00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:51.767 Hey Jim, I thought I'd put gel in my hair. Okay, here's how to put gel in your hair. Start with a small amount, about a pea-sized drop, and rub it between your palms.  00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:57.500 Apply it evenly, working from the roots to the ends. Style as desired, and add more gel if needed.  00:24:58.782 --> 00:25:02.782 Yeah, thanks. I'll do that. Gemini?  00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:08.971 Okay. Four tips on styling it. Great, thank you, I will.  00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:09.974 That's good, okay.  00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:21.368 Okay. All right, perfect. Um\u2026 Okay, so the next one, um, next topic was meal preparation and cooking. Again, that one.  00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:30.229 Uh, was when, uh, on one of the\u2026 on past Tuesday, actually, when you were not around, so we can probably practice some of the commands from.  00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:34.949 Maybe last year you remember how we talked about making shopping lists.  00:25:34.225 --> 00:25:44.225 Um, by adding or viewing or, um, listing the items that were on the shopping list, and then removing items.  00:25:44.728 --> 00:25:51.728 Um, we could find recipes, um. Or find recipes related to some certain dietary restrictions.  00:25:52.986 --> 00:26:00.986 Whether it could be, um, gluten-free or vegan, um, or another one of the dietary restrictions that, um, some people might have.  00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:08.125 Finding nutritional facts about different foods, for example, number of grams of sugar or sodium.  00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:14.337 In a particular food item, um, finding calories in certain\u2026 some kind of food.  00:26:14.563 --> 00:26:23.563 Um, finding the ingredients for cooking a specific food. And then following the recipe and, like, instruction by instruction or step by step.  00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:31.177 So, based on all of those ideas, let's find two activities related to meal preparation.  00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:40.224 Um, before you do, I wanted to ask you, is there\u2026 Particularly anything that has changed from the past year that.  00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:47.858 You've been contributing more towards, uh, when it comes to meal preparation. Is there\u2026 Are there things that have changed?  00:26:47.258 --> 00:26:51.258 Um, while you are in the kitchen with your parents, or.  00:26:54.425 --> 00:26:58.425 Yeah, well, I came home from the Army. And\u2026 they weren't with me.  00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.330 You know, while you're helping them prep.  00:26:58.248 --> 00:27:09.248 So, that's a big change. Michael, what about, um, when going to Costco, what have you been doing more of?  00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:21.379 Putting the list on what? Okay? Yes. He's been making the list for us on\u2026 And then when we're at\u2026 for example, Costco.  00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:19.963 Okay.  00:27:21.942 --> 00:27:27.942 Because it comes with glasses, he will just say\u2026 I'll say to him, here's, you know, the strawberries, the bananas.  00:27:28.365 --> 00:27:34.365 And he'll tell her. Check off strawberries, check off bananas, that kind of thing. Interesting.  00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:40.673 Okay, so mainly manage\u2026 making and managing lists. Uh, for shopping is something that you do.  00:27:40.914 --> 00:27:53.914 Um, and I think, um, A is a perfect solution when it comes to something like that, or even\u2026 even the phone's assistant, um, S would do a better job, I guess, because it would directly put.  00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:59.265 On the notes, um, section, um, and make a list there, so that makes sense.  00:27:59.647 --> 00:28:06.647 Um, so let\u2026 do you think you want to try making a list? Or, like, is there something that you want to add to?  00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:13.252 Um, your shopping list, um, that we could, we could practice now, or is there something else that you would like to do?  00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:19.483 Michael, do you want to make a list, or do you want to\u2026 Yeah, I would like to make a list.  00:28:25.682 --> 00:28:27.682 Should I go to Alexa?  00:28:27.403 --> 00:28:31.403 Yeah, yeah, you can, uh, I think your mom's just getting Alexa\u2026  00:28:33.821 --> 00:28:35.821 Sure.  00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:49.434 Michael's phone is having some major technical difficulties. That on the side has broken off, so\u2026 We're waiting, kind of, for his sister to get back, so I can change the plan and the phones and everything.  00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:38.275 Oh, your iPad, okay, yeah.  00:28:42.845 --> 00:28:44.845 Oh!  00:28:56.498 --> 00:28:58.498 It's one of those things.  00:28:56.698 --> 00:29:03.698 Too many things when there's too\u2026 so many technologies together at use, so\u2026  00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.400 As your daughter gets older, you'll understand my pain.  00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:15.030 Okay, Michael, it's ready. Yeah, let's see\u2026 Add marshmallows to my Costco list.  00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:09.933 I know, I know.  00:29:20.352 --> 00:29:26.352 Okay, um, so are you\u2026 are you\u2026 are you managing, like, multiple lists?  00:29:21.321 --> 00:29:23.321 Marshmallows added to Costco.  00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:34.223 Because you said Costco list, so, um, are there, like. Different lists for different places that you usually manage?  00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:40.941 Yeah. What's the other one? Oops, Halbertson? Halbertson's.  00:29:44.014 --> 00:29:48.014 Go ahead. Hey, Alexa.  00:29:45.364 --> 00:29:48.364 Okay. Makes sense.  00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:54.663 Add cookies to my Albertson's most. Cookies added to Albertsons?  00:29:54.448 --> 00:30:05.448 Okay, perfect. That's really good. Um, anything else that you do with respect to meal preparation when you're in the kitchen?  00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:11.706 Um, with your dad or your mom while they're cooking, or before they start to cook?  00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:21.180 Hey, Alexa, I'd pass to the Albertsons list. That's the pasta on the olives.  00:30:22.374 --> 00:30:28.374 What else do you do, though, to help? Michael sometimes helps with, like, cutting or that type of thing.  00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:35.974 Oh, okay. Um, do you have any questions when you\u2026 when you have to do anything of that sort related to it?  00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:44.315 No, this guy, Cesar, he's my OT specialist. Got me some gloves that are pretty nice.  00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:55.245 Um, Michael sets a lot of timers, as well. For a meal. Tonight, you set a timer for the pizza, right?  00:30:48.645 --> 00:30:50.645 Okay. All right.  00:30:57.114 --> 00:30:58.114 Okay.  00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:14.808 Right. Like, how much, like, that would tell you, um, how much time you should boil something for, or, like, just steam something for, and just put a timer, and then\u2026 Okay. Got it. Alright, but that's pretty good. Like, I think managing lists was\u2026  00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:01.869 Um.  00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:20.588 It was definitely great. Um, do you\u2026 do you have anything else that you would like to find out, like.  00:31:20.917 --> 00:31:30.917 Um, finding caloric, um, calories in foods, or nutritional facts about any food that you'd like to ask, and maybe we could, this time try to use Gemini.  00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:36.243 And see if that works, and how that would work, because we've not gotten to practice this part.  00:31:38.064 --> 00:31:43.064 Okay? What question are you going to ask?  00:31:44.679 --> 00:31:49.679 How much sugar is in the cookies I eat? What can cookies are you talking about?  00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:56.206 Symptoms. Okay. To make sure\u2026 specific on the type, okay?  00:32:02.792 --> 00:32:04.792 How much sugar is in the Tim Tams?  00:32:04.606 --> 00:32:09.606 I couldn't find how much sugar is in Tim Tams. You might be able to find that information on the nutrition label.  00:32:09.863 --> 00:32:14.863 On the packaging, or on the manufacturer's website. Okay, thank you.  00:32:15.163 --> 00:32:19.163 Hey, Gemini. Much sugar is in the mono?  00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:27.259 Okay, according to the official Milo website, a cup of Milo has about 1 teaspoon of added sugar.  00:32:27.127 --> 00:32:33.127 That's on top of the natural sugars from the milk and malt barley. Does that answer your question? Yeah, it does. Thank you.  00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:40.363 Okay, so that's good. I mean, if it doesn't have\u2026 an answer to any question, then it will just say that.  00:32:40.548 --> 00:32:49.548 You know, it\u2026 I don't know about that. Yeah, and where to find it. Yeah, that's\u2026 that's really good.  00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:49.509 Yeah, and where to find it?  00:32:49.557 --> 00:33:02.557 Alright, so that's the end of our review. Um, let me stop sharing for a minute, and then\u2026 We'll move on to, um, some of the questions.  00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:11.716 That we have here, uh\u2026 okay. All right, um, so I'm just gonna ask.  00:33:11.962 --> 00:33:18.962 This was also the last time that we did the training that, um, we just asked questions about how you find the training.  00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:28.933 Um, what kind of problems or challenges you faced, and, um, just sharing about the AI in general, and the training satisfaction, etc, okay?  00:33:29.184 --> 00:33:35.184 So I'll start, Michael, with you, um, and Maureen, you can chime in anytime you, um.  00:33:35.064 --> 00:33:44.064 Anytime you think you wanted to contribute. So, some of these questions I'm starting with are related to AI satisfaction.  00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:55.920 So, was it difficult or easy for you to use your, um, AI? So, Gemini or your glasses, for that matter? We're going to take both into consideration, since.  00:33:56.342 --> 00:34:07.342 We've used both through the training, and you use those. I think you use your glasses a lot during your day-to-day life, so\u2026 tell me about it, how easy or difficult you think.  00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:12.691 I'm using in my glass store. Thank you, Gemini.  00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:19.450 Okay. Okay, so same with Gemini and ER glasses, it's easy for you to use them. Okay.  00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:26.969 I think both the glasses in Gemini pick up where. The A device.  00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:26.099 All right.  00:34:27.314 --> 00:34:34.314 Leaves off, basically. They all have their place, truly. They truly have their own place.  00:34:32.765 --> 00:34:34.765 Yeah.  00:34:34.195 --> 00:34:44.195 But I can see, um\u2026 For certain activities, one is better than the other, but if you can't get the answer on one, you can go to another. And that's nice, having that option.  00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:52.985 Yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, what specific problems. Um, have you faced with Gemini?  00:34:52.613 --> 00:35:07.613 Um, for example, does it have\u2026 difficulties understanding your speech, um, or does it have any difficulties understanding your language, or\u2026 or any sort of navigation issues that you've had with Gemini?  00:35:08.992 --> 00:35:13.992 There's not really any. Um, actually, no.  00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:20.792 When we were in the car on Tuesday, we asked a question, and it.  00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:29.900 Could not understand what we were asking. Um, so we had to rework it. I'm trying to think of what that question was. Me too.  00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:43.125 It had to do with that boat in Australia. We had to, um\u2026 I think it was the way the question was worded the first time, it was unable\u2026 it gave information, but it was not.  00:35:43.507 --> 00:35:50.507 Accurate. It was about something that happened somewhere else in Australia. But when we added, um\u2026 The Banana Beach?  00:35:51.473 --> 00:35:59.473 Yes, that's right. When we added Brisbane to it. Where we're a little bit more specific, it gave a more specific answer.  00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:04.696 Okay, makes sense. All right, so that.  00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:10.747 But when it comes to\u2026 so, you have to sometimes tweak your language and the words.  00:36:10.504 --> 00:36:15.504 Um, to make sure that it gives the information that you're looking for.  00:36:15.196 --> 00:36:27.196 That makes sense. Okay. All right, um\u2026 how about speech? I think\u2026 Is there any difficulty? Do you feel with respect to understanding of speech, or.  00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:41.874 Um, navigation with Gemini, I think ever since you found the live option, that\u2026 He could go live on Gemini. I think it's\u2026 it's really good. I guess the navigation has become much easier.  00:36:42.328 --> 00:36:46.328 Yes, it has. But remember last week when we were on live?  00:36:46.862 --> 00:36:53.862 Asked it a question, and they couldn't answer that question. Remember? I can't remember what it was for.  00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:52.611 Yeah.  00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:59.950 I can't remember what it was, but we were\u2026 we asked a question on live, and it said you have to go.  00:37:01.403 --> 00:37:09.403 Oh, oh, I think it was, like, um, asking us to link it to Google Workspace or something, and it was about the events.  00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:06.333 We don't have the capability yet to\u2026  00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:19.644 Um, trying to\u2026 Yeah, trying to set up events, um, and the same happened\u2026 What's that?  00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:16.866 Something along those lines, yeah.  00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:30.031 Calendar, yes, yes. It kind of told that, um, it would not be able to\u2026 yes, that\u2026 those kind of questions, I guess, are tasks where.  00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:24.785 On the calendar, that's right.  00:37:30.243 --> 00:37:35.243 It's linked to a certain calendar. If it does not have access to it, it's gonna have a hard time.  00:37:35.577 --> 00:37:57.577 Um, linking it, or, you know, that's going to be definitely there. So, when it comes to reminders, or scheduling appointments, or any of that, I guess, um\u2026 the others are much better, instead of, like, using AI, and I think you're already doing that, and it's\u2026 that's perfect, you know? Whatever's working is working, and\u2026  00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:06.250 We don't want to fix what's not broken, you know? So it's\u2026 That's\u2026 that's good. Um, alright. So\u2026 that's good.  00:38:06.698 --> 00:38:17.698 Um, what do you like most about having Gemini, Michael? Yeah. So the speech recognition part is very good.  00:38:14.901 --> 00:38:16.901 He understands me pretty well.  00:38:17.718 --> 00:38:26.718 Um, it's\u2026 it's a much\u2026 I think it's, um, it's much better when\u2026 when compared to last\u2026 last year's training with Alexa, I guess, because.  00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:47.030 You know, if there were words or names of movies. Um, people or topics, you know, or something like a proper noun. And I think it was not correctly pronounced, it would not take that, like, and it would\u2026 You know, we had so much reworking always with the commands that we used to do.  00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:54.733 Um, so that definitely is\u2026 it's really good. Um, and then what do you dislike the most about having Gemini?  00:38:55.526 --> 00:38:59.526 A good thing, too, is Gemini allows a bit of a pause.  00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:03.959 Um, a lot of times, your follow-up question has to be really quick.  00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:10.449 There's Gemini allows a little bit more of a pause, allows a little bit more time for that follow-up question.  00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:09.959 Yeah.  00:39:10.499 --> 00:39:16.499 Um, actually, and it allows a little bit more time than Michael's glasses allows.  00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:23.665 Oh, okay. So that's even a difference between those two, um, AI tools, I mean, in that case.  00:39:23.774 --> 00:39:34.774 That's great, okay. Um\u2026 Yeah, there's definitely, um\u2026 and sometimes if you, if, if you\u2026 talk too quickly after, you know, the.  00:39:34.753 --> 00:39:42.753 Um, after seeing the wake word, it still takes that information. Um, and if sometimes you don't say Gemini.  00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:50.310 And you start just talking when you're alive, it still takes up that information. You don't have to every time say that, which.  00:39:50.983 --> 00:40:04.983 Which I think is really good when it comes to, um\u2026 You know, just normal\u2026 normalizing, like, a conversation between two humans. Like, you don't always\u2026 say the person's name or something, right? So that\u2026 that makes sense.  00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:08.062 A little bit of a sound, because Michael didn't have to ask.  00:40:08.086 --> 00:40:20.086 Use, say, Gemini. Tonight at all, because it makes a little sound. I don't know if you heard the sound, but it's almost like a\u2026 Like, when you turn on a device, you can hear a little sound.  00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:17.979 Yeah.  00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:25.501 Like a whoosh, so to speak, and so he would hear that, and then just go from there.  00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:24.369 Um, okay.  00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:31.330 Right, so you would know that it's on, and, like, you can\u2026 you can talk now, and makes sense.  00:40:31.722 --> 00:40:35.722 Is there anything that you dislike about Gemini, about having Gemini?  00:40:40.092 --> 00:40:46.092 That's the difference between Gemini and A, because A just gives you a blue light.  00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.406 No? Okay. All right.  00:40:46.564 --> 00:40:52.564 Yeah. Yes. Yeah.  00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:50.667 And if you cannot see the blue light, you don't know if it's on or not.  00:40:53.990 --> 00:41:02.990 That's a big difference, that's right. Um, what would you change to Gemini, um, to make it easier to use? Is there anything?  00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:58.058 So that's a big difference between the two.  00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:09.967 Divorce recognition? Well, but it is recognizing your voice.  00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:30.175 Yeah, I think that's\u2026 that's what I think speech and word recognition is pretty good when you're comparing, um, Gemini to A, I guess, because it\u2026 It's definitely doing better, but is there anything that you would change to make it\u2026  00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.073 Speed recognition?  00:41:30.636 --> 00:41:39.636 In any other aspect, like how, um\u2026 It could be anything else, too, and, you know, it doesn't have to be something.  00:41:42.516 --> 00:41:48.516 Speech recognition? Um, we're not sure if Gemini goes through Michael's glasses or not.  00:41:48.762 --> 00:41:53.762 And so, if it doesn't, that would be a definite plus.  00:41:53.750 --> 00:42:00.750 Because remember, made us doing their own AI, so I don't know that it would go through the glasses.  00:42:00.797 --> 00:42:19.797 Yeah, yeah. Because, you know, like, the glasses allow him to\u2026 add things to the\u2026 to A, and, like, you know, for the shopping list and things like that, so those two can be synced, but\u2026 Yeah, I'm not sure. That might be something to look into, um, if those\u2026 if it would\u2026  00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:41.199 Allow Gemini or, you know, some other, like, chat GPT or something, but\u2026 I believe it would not\u2026 Yeah, because you know how Alexa does not allow S, or S does not allow A, like, something\u2026 because those are\u2026 the parallels, like, they are competitors, almost.  00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:20.739 And\u2026  00:42:32.972 --> 00:42:34.972 I agree.  00:42:41.638 --> 00:42:47.638 So I guess that would be\u2026 Yes.  00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:50.210 Classes allow Surrey. But probably because that glass is, no, you need the phone to work.  00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:58.712 Yeah, and I think the glasses might be also okay with, like, a regular Google Assistant.  00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:57.125 Because the glass is paired to the film, so I think that's\u2026  00:42:59.038 --> 00:43:12.038 But not, like, an AI-powered. You know what I mean? Because it has its own AI, but that's interesting. Maybe it's worth checking. Like, I don't know whether, you know, it could just surprise us by having.  00:43:15.502 --> 00:43:22.502 The glasses are paired with the Be My Eyes app. That is their accessibility feature for the blind.  00:43:16.178 --> 00:43:19.178 You know, having the ability to sync.  00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:24.548 Okay. Okay.  00:43:21.978 --> 00:43:26.978 And so that is one thing that they truly are paired with.  00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:42.498 Right, right. Okay, that's\u2026 that's good to know, okay. Alright, so in this training, um, we covered\u2026 four topics. So, we did, um\u2026 news and facts, which is information seeking.  00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:51.938 Um, entertainment, self-care, medical needs. And meal preparation. Um, what topic would you continue to use after this training?  00:43:55.872 --> 00:43:59.872 With, um, with Gemini, especially, and why.  00:44:01.184 --> 00:44:03.184 Meal preparation.  00:44:03.892 --> 00:44:11.892 Because\u2026 I think my parents would be\u2026 Happy if I didn't create a meal preparation.  00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:06.895 Okay. Is there a reason why?  00:44:12.053 --> 00:44:19.053 Yeah, uh, that, for sure, but\u2026 I\u2026 Yes.  00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:22.156 For you personally, forget about us. Entertainment. Go ahead, say it again.  00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:25.269 Entertainment. Okay.  00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:35.296 Um, what specifically in entertainment would you use it for?  00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:43.295 Okay. Um\u2026 Anything new, because you're already doing those things, right? Like, you are playing songs already using your glasses.  00:44:35.698 --> 00:44:37.698 And my favorite songs.  00:44:43.379 --> 00:44:51.379 Is there anything new you would do with, um, with using Gemini, and especially related to entertainment?  00:44:53.887 --> 00:45:04.887 Think about learning, maybe, about\u2026 more about, um\u2026 the different songs, or the different actors, or\u2026 Different movies.  00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:10.848 Yeah. He just said, like, what happened to Hulk Hogan?  00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:12.795 What did you say?  00:45:13.384 --> 00:45:20.384 Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, so that, that makes sense. So, like, you would, you would want to get more information about those.  00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.090 Because, you know, it's all over the news right now.  00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:37.674 You know, those particular\u2026 movies or series related to entertainment, and\u2026 maybe generate, like, synopsis, or\u2026 you know, a little summary of the movie, or a book, or, you know\u2026 Yeah, that would\u2026 that would be great.  00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:43.892 All right, um, so what are your goals\u2026 what were your goals?  00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:51.415 Before we started this training, and have you met them?  00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.260 What was your goal? What was one of your goals? Was it to learn more about Gemini, or\u2026?  00:45:55.302 --> 00:46:02.302 Have you\u2026 do you feel you've met that goal, or\u2026? You think you have?  00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:18.938 We were at the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum. On the weekend. Michael used his glasses a lot there. You know, what am I looking at? You know, you're looking at an Oscar statue by whatever.  00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:08.445 Okay. Yeah.  00:46:15.895 --> 00:46:16.895 Uh-huh.  00:46:16.978 --> 00:46:20.978 Yeah. Mm-hmm.  00:46:19.036 --> 00:46:24.036 Or, you know, the costume that Ryan Seek. Was it\u2026 who was it? Brian Gilligan.  00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:30.179 Ryan, whatever, the guy that wore the pink suit with the diamonds for Barbie?  00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:40.410 I gotta describe that, so he used the glasses a lot for that, to\u2026 what am I looking at? And he was getting information about the different things at the museum.  00:46:34.389 --> 00:46:36.389 Yeah, yeah.  00:46:40.961 --> 00:46:45.961 Yeah, okay. So, that's\u2026 I think the glasses are such a good.  00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:55.550 Tool to have, especially when you're traveling and going places, just to\u2026 get more information, and it's portable enough.  00:46:55.538 --> 00:46:58.538 And you don't have to take your phone out each time.  00:46:58.256 --> 00:47:04.256 To, um, sort of, you know, get, get whatever information you need. So that's perfect.  00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:11.588 Um, so, you've definitely gotten better using AI tools within your class.  00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:21.498 Glasses, and anything else. Um\u2026 that you\u2026  00:47:15.576 --> 00:47:29.576 In the car, on the way back from that museum. We use Gemini to ask a question about, um\u2026 it was something related to the museum. I honestly can't remember what it was.  00:47:25.158 --> 00:47:27.158 Yeah.  00:47:29.332 --> 00:47:34.332 A friend of Michael's was also in the car with us and had asked a question about.  00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:35.158 Yeah.  00:47:34.869 --> 00:47:42.869 One of the shows or things that we saw there. Is it, like, when was the movie, like, Casablanca, or something like that? I can't remember.  00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:47.109 Yeah. Oh.  00:47:42.282 --> 00:47:47.282 What year, so we asked Gemini. That I do remember distinctly.  00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:58.708 Yeah, no, no, but that's great, okay, and, um, did you pick\u2026 Was that your first choice? Like, that you wanted to ask Gemini? And\u2026 okay, alright.  00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.881 I don't remember what movie, for example.  00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:04.560 That's\u2026 Gemini, yeah, okay.  00:48:02.942 --> 00:48:06.942 Gemini, rather than Google it, we just ask Gemini.  00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:09.511 Alright, so, Michael, do you have any suggestions for this training program?  00:48:09.285 --> 00:48:16.285 Ask Gemini what her favorite color is. Michael! So pretty good, guys.  00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:33.046 Anything specific that you have? Like, any suggestions you may have for us, or for the training program, or how it should be, or\u2026 Um, anything differently that we should do.  00:48:21.708 --> 00:48:23.708 Forget the color!  00:48:37.303 --> 00:48:39.303 When is Google gonna let you go?  00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:44.863 When is Google gonna let you leave? Leave what? Good job. Okay.  00:48:46.325 --> 00:48:57.325 I'd say the format that you're doing is very good, and doing the breakout rooms is good, the questions\u2026 the slides that you have, because, um.  00:48:49.294 --> 00:48:50.294 Oh!  00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:05.100 If Michael could see, he would be able to refer back to the slides. I know I was looking at the slides when you would ask your question.  00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.860 Yeah. Okay. Great, okay.  00:49:05.622 --> 00:49:22.622 So I think it's a very good format. And the way that you, um, read it out loud for Michael enables him to participate, so I think\u2026 Yeah, you've made\u2026 You've done the training in a way that, um, maintains Michael's interest.  00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:21.361 For sure.  00:49:22.348 --> 00:49:44.348 Oh, for sure. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's really nice to know. Um, alright, so\u2026 So, do you have any\u2026 questions or feedback about Gemini's responses? Anything\u2026 with the responses that went well, and any challenges that you encounter with the responses that.  00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:54.261 Ever since we started, like, related to Gemini. Um, yeah, any responses that you particularly like, and those went well.  00:49:58.761 --> 00:50:00.761 Versus some things that didn't go well.  00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:04.764 Not that I could think of. I think the responses that were more personable.  00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:06.746 Okay.  00:50:05.438 --> 00:50:09.438 Um, kept Michael's interest, and then he would ask a follow-up question.  00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.920 Yeah, yeah. Back and forth. Mm-hmm.  00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:14.062 Yeah, you could just almost see a conversation going back and forth.  00:50:17.968 --> 00:50:24.968 And if it wasn't as personable, or Gemini wasn't quite understanding what the question was\u2026 Just basically say what?  00:50:29.156 --> 00:50:39.156 Yeah, yeah, that was the good part. Um\u2026 Definitely, like, how\u2026 especially with the sugar content that you just asked, like, you know, I did not know the answer.  00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:33.125 It kind of cut the conversation quickly.  00:50:39.566 --> 00:50:48.566 And it still gave you a good\u2026 follow-up, like, you know, response that, oh, you could check here, like, you know, instead of, like, just giving a vague and incorrect answer.  00:50:48.285 --> 00:50:56.285 Um, so that makes sense. Um, what are some of the challenges that you encountered, um, when asking for responses?  00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:13.010 Speech recognition? I would guess not responding\u2026 quick enough. Like, not ask\u2026 If you weren't quite sure what you were asking.  00:51:13.924 --> 00:51:18.924 And you start talking, and you're not\u2026 and you're trying to come up with the correct answer.  00:51:17.478 --> 00:51:19.478 Mm-hmm.  00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:23.646 Yeah. Okay, okay.  00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:24.776 She loses you. A little bit quicker.  00:51:24.506 --> 00:51:33.506 Be a little bit quicker in terms of responses, okay. Um, anything else that you can think of when it comes to challenges?  00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:40.244 She understands me most of the time, but not all the time.  00:51:40.747 --> 00:51:45.747 Okay. All right, um, can you give me an example?  00:51:45.707 --> 00:51:51.707 Of when she doesn't understand? Yeah.  00:51:48.726 --> 00:51:56.726 When she doesn't? Angie, when you mumble a little bit? You wanna mumble a little bit? She'll be like, what did you say?  00:51:57.611 --> 00:52:03.611 I'll clear my throat and say\u2026 I've said this, that, or the third.  00:52:00.569 --> 00:52:02.569 Yeah. Yeah.  00:52:04.804 --> 00:52:11.804 Okay, all right. That makes sense, okay. Um\u2026 Another\u2026 this is my personal thing, but.  00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:26.059 I think when we first started and we did the\u2026 Participatory design, especially when we were talking about all the responses, Michael. Um, and you know how you asked about the conflict between Israel and Iran.  00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:30.210 And it just sort of gave you, like, so much information at once.  00:52:45.419 --> 00:52:53.419 Oh, hi! Claire, um, are we done with Michael?  00:52:53.220 --> 00:53:01.220 No, we're still on 3.1. Yeah. No, you're good. Are you\u2026 yeah, I don't know.  00:52:55.207 --> 00:53:07.207 Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I mostly just want to say bye to Michael, and then we'll probably let her go, yeah, because we finished early, sorry about that.  00:53:09.155 --> 00:53:27.155 Okay. Um\u2026 Let's see, Rosie, I may just, um, ask you to share with Claire and Peter, um, like, one quick command, and then maybe we don't get enough time to show Michael.  00:53:27.531 --> 00:53:47.531 If you want to show them stuff you work on today as a final, um\u2026 Oh, there, there's Prayal. Hi! Sorry for interrupting, I know you two are still going. Um, Rosie, you wanna say hi before our summer program ends, so I just figured Rosie will show something, and then we'll let you go back to the room again.  00:53:30.662 --> 00:53:32.662 Great, okay.  00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:57.827 Oh, yeah, I was just gonna\u2026 I was using Gemini for, um\u2026 Like, through the health, um, like, personal health, um.  00:53:51.446 --> 00:53:53.446 Yeah, sorry about interrupting.  00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:03.590 Like. Like, things to do to, like.  00:54:03.606 --> 00:54:14.606 Calm yourself down. So it's like, um\u2026 like, calming yourself doing music and going outside, and just like\u2026 she would give me a list of things to do.  00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:25.280 And is doing creative and doing, um\u2026 self-care, and I\u2026 is music soothing? Does I\u2026 Using, um, Gemini to give you these.  00:54:25.057 --> 00:54:42.057 That are problems, so you can find. Find, like, calm, or just being\u2026 in a good state of mind through things like journaling and the aromatherapy, and just\u2026 He's even just petting them, or just listening to music and writing it down so they\u2026  00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:59.779 Do you ever know is a platform I can get all these\u2026 it's just, like, a short list of things, you just care for yourself, like doing exercise, or\u2026 Lucky, she wants you, oh, you can do some aromatherapy and\u2026 Jess, she just gives you a list of things you can back yourself up with, like, self-care.  00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:06.510 Rosie is sharing the list of things that Gemini told her, and she shared her screen.  00:55:06.276 --> 00:55:12.276 Showing the different, um. Suggestions that Jim and I gave her. Okay, that's nice.  00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:18.043 You can do this. Yeah\u2026  00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:21.510 And do you want to read, um, maybe one more thing, one or two things that you may, um.  00:55:16.662 --> 00:55:18.662 Share your screen, Rosie.  00:55:21.098 --> 00:55:26.098 Do this summer, so Michael can know your summer\u2026 rest of your summer plan?  00:55:26.439 --> 00:55:33.439 Oh, like, you know\u2026 Like, like, end of next week, and coming next couple weeks.  00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.680 The U.S. Open of Surfing is in Huntington, and we're using Gemini to, um.  00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:44.447 They find parking and\u2026 They're looking for, um, survey competitions, because.  00:55:44.294 --> 00:55:50.294 We asked her about, like. One will be the longboard surfing, um.  00:55:50.275 --> 00:56:02.275 Contest happened, because I like surfing longboard, because. I was just, like, want to watch that, because I'm not that\u2026 really that great, but I just like watching, so just using Gemini to, like.  00:56:01.967 --> 00:56:09.967 Giving information about things I like to watch, just\u2026 Just to, um, for my own summer plans, yeah.  00:56:14.598 --> 00:56:18.598 Michael, do you have anything you want to tell Rosie before we let her go?  00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.538 Thank you for the information, Rosie.  00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:24.387 Tell her, um, what we asked, um, Gemini when we were in the car, coming back from the beach.  00:56:24.858 --> 00:56:28.858 We asked Gemini to, uh\u2026 We're gonna streamline where we were.  00:56:29.592 --> 00:56:34.592 About the boat in Australia. About the boat in Australia. There's a boat that crashed.  00:56:35.407 --> 00:56:41.407 That crashed on Rainbow Beach. And my boss told us about Rainbow Beach, because he was from Australia.  00:56:44.035 --> 00:56:53.035 And this ship crashed in the 80s, or the 70s. And so Gemini gave an obscure fact that was truthful.  00:56:56.965 --> 00:57:06.965 Oh, no, thanks. Here you go, like, a family connection, but it's like\u2026 kind of is\u2026 I don't know if history's\u2026 feel, you feel it.  00:56:57.079 --> 00:57:01.079 From the 70s, when his father lived in Australia, and\u2026  00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:07.289 Yeah.  00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:14.630 His dad had told him a story, and Michael verified the story with Gemini.  00:57:11.057 --> 00:57:13.057 Some kind of connection, yeah.  00:57:14.004 --> 00:57:31.004 Oh, yeah, using that, it's kind of\u2026 it's like\u2026 This really happened, like\u2026 Okay, is it\u2026 Gemini knows it was there, so\u2026 backing information to what your dad told you, so you\u2026 It was a real thing, so\u2026 used to jeopardize, like, another\u2026  00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:36.125 I think another perspective. For us to, like, use in our life, yeah.  00:57:32.964 --> 00:57:34.964 Yeah.  00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:44.413 Thank you so much for sharing, Michael, and pray I'll let you folks go back into your room.  00:57:40.588 --> 00:57:42.588 Yeah, that's right.  00:57:45.126 --> 00:57:53.126 Yeah, and um, Kaylee and Lori and Orisha and Rosie, you are afraid to go. Have a\u2026 Nice up the summer, we'll stay in touch.  00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:49.756 Okay.  00:57:50.828 --> 00:57:54.828 All right, okay. Okay, bye.  00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:05.597 Thank you, you guys, too.  00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:23.211 Okay, so you want me to take the notes? Okay.  00:58:22.352 --> 00:58:32.352 Um, alright, so, um\u2026 Yeah, sorry, Maureen. I think we were talking about\u2026 Where do we go?  00:58:33.046 --> 00:58:40.046 Yeah, um\u2026 from your perspective, how can we make the AI responses more relevant to you?  00:58:43.045 --> 00:58:50.045 Right, and\u2026 I remember we were just talking about it, and then it went off.  00:58:45.305 --> 00:58:47.305 That's\u2026 that's the question we were discussing.  00:58:54.818 --> 00:58:59.818 I know, I know. Um\u2026  00:58:58.951 --> 00:59:02.951 To make the AI more relevant. Um.  00:59:04.106 --> 00:59:14.106 Well, I think Gemini picks up. Where maybe the glasses lets off, or Alexa likes\u2026 Um, where the different devices.  00:59:04.996 --> 00:59:05.996 Yeah.  00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:25.930 Stop Gemini picks up. And it gives\u2026 And another opportunity, like, if you can't get the answer from your phone on Chess.  00:59:18.419 --> 00:59:20.419 Yeah. Mhm.  00:59:26.831 --> 00:59:40.831 Because from my era, I was new to Google, we would just start Googling everything, and now it's almost as if you don't need to Google anymore, you can just ask Gemini, and you'll get an instant response.  00:59:40.227 --> 00:59:45.227 And for Michael, who grew up with all of the technology.  00:59:45.265 --> 00:59:52.265 It's so easy for him just to ask his glasses, or\u2026 because he's wearing them most times, and he will say.  00:59:52.275 --> 00:59:59.275 Well, I need my glasses to see. And so, because it tells him the information that he needs.  00:59:59.055 --> 01:00:08.055 More so than just asking the phone anymore. If the glasses isn't giving the answer quick enough, he can ask Gemini.  01:00:07.967 --> 01:00:16.967 Yes. Okay, so, like, different tools will give different kind of responses, and there were one\u2026 if one falls short, something.  01:00:17.173 --> 01:00:23.173 There's another platform to pick up and try that for asking that particular question.  01:00:23.352 --> 01:00:35.352 Okay, that makes sense. Um\u2026 All right. Um\u2026 So, any command examples that you can specifically share when it comes to.  01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:44.140 Um, you know, how one\u2026 uh, one platform will let\u2026 let off, and then, you know, some other platform would pick up.  01:00:45.955 --> 01:00:50.955 All I can think of is the calendar. If you ask.  01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.430 Is there a specific example?  01:00:51.138 --> 01:01:02.138 Um, S on the phone. What am I doing today? Or what's\u2026 on my calendar. She might say, oh, you have 3 events today.  01:00:58.177 --> 01:01:04.177 Yeah. Mm-hmm.  01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.200 Yeah.  01:01:02.003 --> 01:01:09.003 And you can say, what are the events? You have 3 events today. Whereas if you ask Alexa.  01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:16.501 She was like, you have 3 events today. At 8 o'clock, you are going to the brain, and at 10 o'clock, you have.  01:01:13.284 --> 01:01:15.284 Uh-huh.  01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:21.365 A dental appointment. It will give\u2026 it will literally read your calendar to you.  01:01:22.009 --> 01:01:28.009 And then the downfall is Gemini won't go into your calendar unless they have access.  01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:27.465 Correct.  01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:46.530 Yeah. Um, can you think of something other way around where\u2026 where AI or Gemini, where\u2026 Um, and the glasses would pick up and, and where Alexa or\u2026 S would not respond to, or not respond appropriately.  01:01:51.523 --> 01:01:54.523 Are there any topics or examples like that?  01:01:56.409 --> 01:02:09.409 Um\u2026 Well, with the glasses, Michael can\u2026 is really good, like, with playing a lot of his music, and then asking questions about the author.  01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:16.224 Who wrote the song, or when did it come out, or\u2026 play something similar to it.  01:02:16.893 --> 01:02:21.893 And it's all linked to his\u2026 to the Apple Music, right? And which is on this phone.  01:02:17.563 --> 01:02:19.563 Yeah.  01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:28.808 Whereas\u2026 the A Alexa is more linked to.  01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:40.892 Amazon Music. Um\u2026 And I would guess, um, we haven't done it, but actually, we kind of did it in a roundabout way.  01:02:34.676 --> 01:02:36.676 Right.  01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:54.283 Asking Gemini about certain things related to that song. You could get it, and especially\u2026 Like, if the song is from a movie, for example, when we were at the museum in Los Angeles last weekend.  01:02:54.328 --> 01:03:06.328 He could have said, what is the theme song from Casablanca? And that type of thing, and he would have gotten that from Gemini, and probably gotten more information from Gemini than from his classes.  01:03:02.876 --> 01:03:04.876 Yeah.  01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:20.381 Got it, okay, okay. All right, makes sense. Um, so we're interested in designing the AI response to be more interactive, um, so\u2026 imagine, like, a virtual clinician.  01:03:20.275 --> 01:03:28.275 Um, for you to, um, help you with your needs. Um, so when this training is not on, um, say you needed.  01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:34.172 You know, any, any, um\u2026 anything that you need, like a virtual clinician for.  01:03:34.297 --> 01:03:39.297 What kinds of help would you like to receive from this kind of agent?  01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:44.830 Well, I think what Michael did tonight, when we were doing those examples with his hair.  01:03:45.206 --> 01:03:51.206 And yeah, it's like, how do I comb my hair? Because that's one thing in EOS, I, have I done my hair properly?  01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:50.662 Yes.  01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:58.128 And he asked that follow-up question, how do I apply the type of hairsty, and then the hair gel.  01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.240 Yeah. No. Mm-hmm.  01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:06.327 That was all very relevant to a 25-year-old. And so, I think that was very appropriate.  01:04:05.238 --> 01:04:07.238 Yeah, yeah.  01:04:06.129 --> 01:04:12.129 Um, I could see the virtual\u2026 I mean, it worked with Gemini doing that, right?  01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.412 Mm-hmm.  01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:18.052 Right, right.  01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:32.434 And, um\u2026 more so, like, stuff like that. Um\u2026 how do I\u2026 I would guess you could even say something like, how do I\u2026 brush my teeth to make sure I clean them all, or, um\u2026  01:04:27.507 --> 01:04:35.507 Yeah, yeah. So, would you say that when it comes to, like, a virtual agent or a virtual clinician, it would be more of.  01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:51.704 Um, providing ideas of what. Kind of questions and what kind of content he could ask for. Um, so that the\u2026 he could use the, um, platforms or the tools to the fullest of its ability.  01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:59.472 I think so, yeah. Um\u2026 Because I think the biggest difference is Michael has a TBI.  01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:12.661 And so\u2026 And me being older, and so I'm having to try to figure it out compared to someone like Peter, for example, who is.  01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:05.573 Yeah.  01:05:12.444 --> 01:05:20.444 Closer in age to Michael, who doesn't have a TBI, I'm sure he just can come up with stuff like this, where, um.  01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:25.048 Right. Yeah. Right.  01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:28.184 Michael's starting to get back to that type of way, whereas for me, it's a whole new learning experience.  01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:41.749 Correct. Correct. Okay, alright, that makes so much sense. Um, thank you for sharing that. Um, okay, so\u2026 Um, what information do you want to share with this kind of virtual agent?  01:05:42.993 --> 01:05:51.993 Or what information do you want the agent to learn, so that it could help you with the homework, or\u2026 like, the training of this training.  01:05:53.136 --> 01:06:00.136 Um, I think the more you use the AI, the more the AI learns about you.  01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:10.060 So, for instance, with Michael's glasses. He can ask a question, like, um\u2026 I'm blonde. Hey, Maida!  01:06:10.544 --> 01:06:13.544 What am I looking at? And Maida will give a description.  01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:21.802 And then Michael can say, remember, Maida, I'm blind, and my Maida will then give a more comprehensive description.  01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:19.588 Mm-hmm.  01:06:21.587 --> 01:06:31.587 As somebody's looking at. And so, the AI responds to that when you say, remember, I'm blind, or I am blind, what am I looking at?  01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:27.888 Yeah.  01:06:31.702 --> 01:06:34.702 Or, I am blind, is it safe to cross the street?  01:06:34.443 --> 01:06:46.443 That's not a good example, because they won't\u2026 no AI will tell you it's safe to cross the street because that's a safety issue. But, um, it might say, are there any cars in my vicinity?  01:06:35.613 --> 01:06:37.613 Yes.  01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:48.625 Yeah. Yes.  01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:54.293 She's fine. Yeah, she's right there, she's okay. She was asking about the dog.  01:06:54.673 --> 01:07:04.673 But I think, um\u2026 Yeah, so no AI will tell you, yes, you can cross the street, but they can tell you, um, if you say, remember, I'm blind.  01:07:04.924 --> 01:07:07.924 What is on the sign above me. It will read the sign.  01:07:07.696 --> 01:07:16.696 Right. Yeah, and it's almost like\u2026 you want to learn your own history and your own, like.  01:07:12.025 --> 01:07:14.025 More detail.  01:07:16.218 --> 01:07:23.218 To remember the facts about. About yourself, and then respond.  01:07:23.016 --> 01:07:34.016 Um, appropriately, you know. Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, I'm almost\u2026 I should be done, um, I guess.  01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:34.139 Yes, definitely. Michael's just throwing the dog up.  01:07:34.526 --> 01:07:42.526 Alright, so\u2026 Alright, what would be, um, ideal interaction between.  01:07:38.276 --> 01:07:40.276 This is a screen I'll open.  01:07:42.457 --> 01:07:48.457 Between Michael and the agent, so a virtual agent like that, who would be helping with.  01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:58.301 You know, maintaining the learnings from this kind of training.  01:07:55.167 --> 01:08:03.167 Well, I noticed that when Michael uses Gemini. He would say things like, um.  01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:09.959 Thank you, and Gemini responds back, you're welcome, that type of thing. And it's more conversational.  01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:17.042 Listen. And, um\u2026 And even with follow-up questions on both ways, whether it's from Michael or from the agent.  01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:15.916 Yes.  01:08:17.195 --> 01:08:22.195 When they were asking about, um. The weather in Africa.  01:08:22.023 --> 01:08:28.023 And Michael said, well, how's about in, you know, Tanzania? He went to the different places, his sister's got.  01:08:22.378 --> 01:08:28.378 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:31.956 And then she\u2026 he said, thank you. She said, you're welcome.  01:08:32.387 --> 01:08:37.387 That makes a difference, I think, because it's just part of a typical conversation.  01:08:35.798 --> 01:08:37.798 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:42.712 Whereas, even with Alexa, he'll say, oh, thank you, Alexa, and there's no response.  01:08:41.403 --> 01:08:43.403 Correct.  01:08:43.254 --> 01:08:50.254 Um, Suri responds back. But\u2026 does Maver respond back to you? Maida doesn't.  01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.256 Yeah.  01:08:49.415 --> 01:08:55.415 Does not. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah.  01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:56.979 Gemini does, and Suri does, but Alexa and the glasses don't say, oh, you're welcome.  01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:07.507 Yeah, and I think, um, the other difference when he was asking about the weather, he\u2026 he asked what's the weather in, um, you know, Tanzania? And then, for the.  01:09:07.574 --> 01:09:24.574 Other two locations, he did not say the whole\u2026 question. It was like, how about in\u2026 you know, Uganda, or how about in Kenya? So, it doesn't even, like, it remembers, like, it contextually remembers what the context was and what he was asking in the.  01:09:24.496 --> 01:09:36.496 Question previously, and then kind of repeats and makes up the context on its own, which, which\u2026 Which is different from how A or S would be, um, in this given situation.  01:09:35.265 --> 01:09:45.265 That's right. And with the person with the TBI. Or\u2026 that's a lot easier, because having to remember a big, long prompt.  01:09:42.827 --> 01:09:44.827 Yeah.  01:09:44.983 --> 01:09:48.983 It's a lot different than being able to have it more like a conversation.  01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:58.320 Yeah. Exactly, yes. All right, well\u2026 That\u2026 that really\u2026 that this is it, actually, yeah. Is there anything else you would like to share with us?  01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:07.045 He's like, I'm done. Can you\u2026 can you just, like, be done now? I'm just so done, right?  01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:15.120 Well, Michael, I just want to say thank you so much for another great summer. You taught us so much about AI.  01:10:11.384 --> 01:10:23.384 Thank you. I feel, yes, the same way. I think, and you've done so well, um, since the past year. I think I see huge, huge, um.  01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:30.393 I mean, I think gains in your skills and your language and your speech, especially, I think it's really wonderful.  01:10:34.968 --> 01:10:54.968 And thanks so much for everything you're doing to support her mom, and we\u2026 cannot do this without you every summer, and we love seeing you all making really great, um, explorations and trying out new things with us, and learning from, um, these new available free tools, and, um, yeah, it's been a great summer.  01:10:35.836 --> 01:10:37.836 What do you say, Michael? Thank you.  01:10:38.962 --> 01:10:39.962 Yeah.  01:10:55.096 --> 01:11:02.096 Um, is there anything, um, like, I'll follow up on the gift card, it got to your email. Um, they'll probably do it in waves.  01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:15.735 Nice. Um, and is there anything else you'd like us to follow up with, or, um, if you're interested in maybe doing more of the lessons in the fall and spring semester, we're planning and thinking about that, because we have a few people on the way.  01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:26.596 Yeah, please keep us in mind, because, um, we're learning a lot from it as well. I mean, truthfully, Alexa has been a godsend for Michael, because it's making him more independent.  01:11:19.824 --> 01:11:21.824 So let's the people that are\u2026  01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:35.325 All of these different technologies and the AI. It is helping Michael become more independent, and it's helping us, kind of.  01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:40.404 Think outside the box as well, and that's been wonderful. So we've truly appreciate.  01:11:44.218 --> 01:11:51.218 Thank you. Michael, we're all done. We'll let you go eat your dinner. Thank you so much for being very patient with us.  01:11:44.807 --> 01:11:47.807 Every time you are offered to us, we really do.  01:11:51.857 --> 01:11:57.857 Thank you so much, we appreciate all your help. Thank you. Bye-bye.  01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:08.890 I go, he's so funny. He's like, I'm funny! Okay, Claire K stopped the recording?  01:12:02.307 --> 01:12:03.307 Aye.   , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  It seems like you've asked for a breakdown of a SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note and its function, structure, and issues of concern. Here's a summary:\n\nFunction: The SOAP note serves as a structured method for healthcare providers to document patient encounters in an organized way, providing a framework for evaluating information, diagnosing, and treating patients effectively.\n\nStructure:\n1. Subjective: This section includes the patient's symptoms, history of present illness (HPI), medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, review of systems (ROS), current medications, and allergies.\n2. Objective: This section documents vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n3. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n4. Plan: This section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, therapy needed (medications), specialist referrals, and any other follow-up steps.\n\nIssues of Concern:\n1. Order of information: While the traditional SOAP note follows Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan order, rearranging it to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) may provide quick access to ongoing care information and improve efficiency.\n2. Time integration: The original SOAP model does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap.\n3. Data volume: The shift to electronic documentation has led to the inclusion of large volumes of data, which can burden clinicians if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize relevant information for easy access and efficient diagnosis and treatment. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  The given text in the variable seems to provide a good summary of the purpose and advantages of using a SOAP note. However, it may be beneficial to add more specific and actionable feedback for the language model to help improve its output for this particular objective function. Here's some constructive criticism and suggestions:\n\n1. Emphasize the need for a detailed Subjective section in the generated SOAP note: \"In order to provide a more accurate diagnosis, it's crucial that the generated SOAP note includes a comprehensive Subjective section detailing the patient's symptoms, medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, review of systems (ROS), current medications, and allergies.\"\n\n2. Encourage including Objective data: \"Additionally, to allow healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding treatment plans, it's essential that the generated SOAP note includes vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data in the Objective section.\"\n\n3. Provide examples of Assessment issues: \"Moreover, in the Assessment section, highlight specific areas where the generated SOAP note may lack detail or accuracy, such as problems, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\"\n\n4. Offer suggestions on how to improve the Plan section: \"Lastly, suggest improvements to the Plan section, like considering additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, therapy needed (medications), specialist referrals, or any other follow-up steps that might be beneficial for a more accurate and efficient treatment.\"\n\nBy providing these specific points of feedback, the language model can focus on areas where it needs improvement and adjust its responses to produce a more effective and accurate SOAP note. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation. Specifically, give feedback to the following span of text:\n\n<VARIABLE> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a (...) note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </VARIABLE>\n\nGiven the above history, describe how the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses could be improved to improve the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>.

S:  RT  arrived  to  the  session  on  time,  motivated  and  ready  to  participate  in  the  training.  During  the initial recap session, pt had difficulties with camera and the screen appearing dark. Technical difficulties were troubleshooted by prompting pt to command Alexa to go home. Pt demonstrated commands from previous week\u2019s lesson on entertainment, \u201cAlexa can you play Dani California on YouTube.\" Pt as able to use commands learned last week to play, pause, and change volume in video.  O   3.  User  Needs:  Pt  identified  3  self-care/  health  related  needs  she  has  difficulty  managing due to her left arm weakness including tying her hair into a ponytail, applying lotion, and spills/stains on shirt 2/2 loss of pressure control. Pt identified two technology/tools she currently uses to manage self-care related difficulties. Pt identified 6/10 scenarios to complete the sentence: \u201cI want to learn how to manage/ take care of.\u201d  4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  utilized  voice  commands  to  create  medication  list,  set  reminders,  and ask personal health and self-care related information on the Alexa device in 15/16 trials in a 1:1 setting with the clinician given minimal verbal cues.   A:   3.  User  Needs:  Rosie  appropriately  responded  to  all  user  needs  assessment  interview  questions. During user needs assessment, pt was thoughtful in her responses and transparent about daily barriers to ADLs related to self-care. Pt PLOF was independent, LUE dominant. Currently pt faces challenges managing ADLs (i.e., tying her hair, squeezing lotion) d/t left arm weakness. Pt also reported desire to eat healthier and reduce processed foods in her diet.  4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  met  her  goal  of  using  concise  voice  commands  in  80%  of  trials  to  create medication lists, set alarms/reminders, and inquire about health-related info (i.e., local dentists, laundry, medications) on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues. Pt demonstrated intelligible speech when verbalizing Alexa voice commands and executed 15 commands successfully and independently given an initial model. One command, \u201cwhat do I take for stomach pain\u201d was not executed by Alexa and instead, pt was prompted to ask Alexa to read the medication list. In a group setting, pt demonstrated appropriate sustained attention skills and pragmatics such as turn taking and commenting.  P:  Week  3  homework  will  be  assigned.  Metacognitive  strategy  will  be  implemented  in  next  week\u2019s session to allow pt to reflect and provide feedback on use of Alexa throughout the week to discuss Alexa use for personal needs and ADLs.  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT>  The provided text discusses the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, a widely used method of documentation in healthcare that helps structure and organize information for healthcare providers.\n\nThe SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record. The four headings of a SOAP note are:\n\n1. Subjective - This section documents the patient's personal views or feelings about their condition, known as the chief complaint (CC) and history of present illness (HPI). It also includes medical, surgical, family, social history, and review of systems (ROS).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes the subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including any necessary medications, specialist referrals or consults, and patient education.\n\nThe text also discusses issues of concern regarding the SOAP note, such as its inability to document changes over time and the potential for data-filled notes to burden healthcare providers if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy-to-find places, making it easier for clinicians to follow. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  Based on the provided information, the generated SOAP note closely matches the target SOAP note. The subjective (S), objective (O), assessment (A), and plan (P) sections are all present and contain relevant information about the patient's condition, progress in therapy, identified needs, VAT session results, and homework assignment for the next week.\n\nHowever, there are a few differences between the two SOAP notes:\n\n1. In the target SOAP note, the goal is set for the patient to utilize concise voice commands to execute functional commands related to ADLs with 80% accuracy given moderate verbal cues. In the generated SOAP note, the goal is slightly rephrased, but the core intention remains the same: the patient was able to use concise voice commands in 80% of trials to create medication lists, set alarms/reminders, and inquire about health-related info on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues.\n\n2. In the target SOAP note, there is a specific mention of technical difficulties at the beginning of the session and troubleshooting steps taken to resolve these issues. This detail is not present in the generated SOAP note.\n\n3. In the target SOAP note, the patient's PLOF (Passive Range of Motion) and LUE dominance are mentioned under User Needs, while in the generated SOAP note, this information is not provided.\n\nOverall, the differences between the two SOAP notes are minor, and I would rate the loss score as 2 out of 10. The generated SOAP note closely follows the structure and content of the target SOAP note, making it a valuable summary of the patient's progress and needs in the therapy session. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-01-2024 (Week 3) R.T.

How are you doing, Speaker 3?\n00:00:11 Speaker 3\nI'm doing well because today around half day I went over to my community pool with my dad and we did some treading water and like no water. I'm trying to get back into the pool but like just, you know, it's good for me to be in the water. So. I'm happy because of that. \n00:00:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's really great.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nSo Speaker 6 will be coming in a little bit, so we're going to get started without her. Let me just. Pull up. What I need OK. If you're still trying to fix your computer, I can still give you a minute or I can start. Just let me know when you'r ready.\n00:01:08 Speaker 3\nMaybe you can just start or I can like. Stop video and see what happens, and this is the same so they can move. It's that laptop cameras not working OK. But I can just still listen to you.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 5 is that is that going to be fine? OK. Perfect. OK. Umm, so we were gonna try to look at what we did last week. So last week we were going through and doing playing music or looking at the videos. So I was going to see if you could show me how to play a music or video from your Speaker 7.\n00:02:00 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, I'm Speaker 7. I I just asked her to like go on YouTube and like, play a song and she just. I just do it that way. Just ask for the YouTube video and she plays it when I just say play this.\n00:02:08 Speaker 1\nYeah. So let's see. So last week you were trying to pull up the Olympic ceremonies. I know it was having a difficult time. Did you want to try to pull that up again? Or try something different.\n00:02:40 Speaker 3\nMaybe I'll try to play some music or something.\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:02:45 Speaker 3\nOK, just ask her, OK? Speaker 7. Can you play Banning CA on YouTube.\n00:02:57 Speaker 7\nWhat you need to?\n00:03:13 Speaker 1\nIt's just still searching?\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's playing right now. Like the YouTube is trying to show you on my phone, but. Just playing the song.\n00:03:23 Speaker 1\nSo I can't. I can't hear it, but I last week we worked on turning the volume up and the volume down. Could you try doing that this time?\n00:03:31 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. OK. Speaker 7, can you turn the volume down? Speaker 7, can you turn the sound up?\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n00:03:56 Speaker 3\nCan you stop the video? So it's in there somewhere. I stopped it. Yeah.\n00:04:05 Speaker 1\nOK, great. I think that was easier than last week too.\n00:04:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, because like you know, I've done it most of the times last week. You know, it's indoor rain somewhere, so I can just do it again.\n00:04:22 Speaker 1\nHave you been working on it throughout the week?\n00:04:26 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, like this. I think it was Tuesday we were playing. Like it it like UM. We're listening. I was asking them Speaker 7 to play another song and this it's like I wanted to listen to it and she pulled it up and it's like. Something to getting used to doing.\n00:04:50 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. That's super and that's super useful.\n00:04:54 Speaker 3\nYeah, I know it's new thing is getting part of my routine and saying make her play song and do.\n00:05:05 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Have you have you set it up to the playlist that you made?\n00:05:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, I just ask Speaker 7 like to go on YouTube and like for an artist and just like it just kind of plays some one night for each other. So I'm just, I just go by artist. Yeah.\n00:05:28 Speaker 1\nOK. Great. Today we're going to be talking about self-care needs. So I wanted to find out what type of self-care or health related activity. Do you have difficulties managing?\n00:05:54 Speaker 3\nWell. Trying to think, well, like selfcare is like when they, like tried to. Like she like, want, like, want to look good in the mirror and look at my do my hair and stuff sometimes. Like ohh. My left arm is kind of weaker at this point in our recovery, so my hair up in a ponytail or headband or something. It's like sometimes it's kind of a struggle to get into place.\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:06:27\nYeah.\n00:06:30 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that can? Be a little bit difficult.\n00:06:37 Speaker 3\nWell, I put a lot of lotion on my skin cause I like being in the pool and chlorine eats her skin, so I put it on a lot and so sometimes like I want to put a lot of lotion on and sometimes it gets like your clothes kind of get too lotiony. It's too much on your it's kind of like on your shirt and stuff like. Too much so. So you have to find it in the middle, like too much or too little.\n00:07:11 Speaker 1\nIs it because you squeeze out too much?\n00:07:14 Speaker 3\nI squeeze out too much and then I go there, put this on my face.\n00:07:19 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. And then you have a lot.\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nOf extra. Yeah. So like, I'll put it back in a plastic bag.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nOK. Anything else that self-care related?\n00:07:39 Speaker 3\nI'm well, I'm trying to. Cut down my process. Food in my diet, to where like my eat more like natural food than fruits and grains, and my diet. Not eating like processed food or fast food or like like frozen meals I'm kind of. And make my diet more healthy, so it's good for my overall health. I'm trying to cut those out of my diet.\n00:08:09 Speaker 1\nOK. And and maybe maybe with the food, do you have any technologies or tools? That can help you manage these needs.\n00:08:24 Speaker 3\nWell, I can. Like. Tell my smartphone to. Like. Read me my my shopping list or then say say it to me out loud and so say if I want to go to the grocery store, I want to get that. Not that. So are you gonna get this this this. So it's like in my mind it backs up and ohh I need to shop for this. Then that one too. So I sometimes use that like I need to make a little list in my phone.\n00:09:03 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Like, I mean, yeah, really useful.\n00:09:07 Speaker 3\nI know. Yeah, I like listening everything cause like my background is in science and protocols are all this usually step by step by step.\n00:09:19 Speaker 1\nDo you typically when you're making the list? UM. Do you? Like is it on your computer or? What do you what do you make? Your list on.\n00:09:35 Speaker 3\nOh, on my like my iPhone, there's a little UM notes app, so like if I'm in my in the store I have my phone with me all the time. I don't have a little. I usually get a piece of paper and write it by hand. But if I have it on my phone, out in public, I can just look at it. But. Trying and I can just hold in my hand and look at that. I need to go down the aisle and. Get some milk or something.\n00:10:00 Speaker 1\nAll right, that's great. And then I was wondering, Speaker 3, when you were talking about squeezing out the lotion. Sometimes it squeezes too much. Is that due to weakness? In your arm.\n00:10:14 Speaker 3\nI think it's a combination of. Like weak arm and also how much pressure I can. I'm supposed to use or. I think it's either too much or too little. It's like just. To like round it out, see like. I think it only did like a little squeeze or that I squeeze it too hard. It's like all of it out.\n00:10:37 Speaker 1\nDo you use one hand or two hands?\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nI always use my left hand, it's dominant, but I probably need to use both to too. So in my head I think it's just one hand and I actually need to use 2.\n00:10:52 Speaker 1\nOK. I mean that makes sense. Sometimes I like to use one hand because it seems convenient, but.\n00:10:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, and that's not what I'm supposed to do.\n00:11:03 Speaker 1\nOK. But that's that's good. And that's the way that you can help manage in the future? UM. OK, let's see. So I have something, but I don't know if you take, do you take medications? You don't have to tell me what or any.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nOhh I take medication regularly. I have a little pill case in my bathroom I take I have daily doses to take, yeah.\n00:11:33 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to think of. 10 scenarios to complete this the sentence, so I want to learn to manage my medications. Or slash take care of myself more about. Let's see. So I read the question kind of funny. OK, so I want to learn how to manage my medications or take care of myself more about.\n00:12:28 Speaker 6\nHi. Sorry I'm. I'm so sorry I'm late. I've been commuting to Rancho every single day so. But. Where's Speaker 3?\n00:12:40 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm actually having some camera issues, but I'm here.\n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nOK. Hi, Speaker 3. \n00:12:44 Speaker 3\nHi, Speaker 6. \n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nHello.\n00:12:51 Speaker 1\nWe were just going to try and work on coming up with some sentences about managing our medication or self-care. So is there anything that you want to maybe have to learn to manage medications or anything that you think would help?\n00:13:21 Speaker 3\nWell. I I say I take daily medication for my. I have like dose. I got regular dosage ofpills for like anti seizure meds and  I just need to take them twice daily so maybe I need to put like alarms on my phone for the times it's supposed to go and like oh, I know that that's for that.\n00:13:50 Speaker 1\nOK, so alarms you said two times a day.\n00:13:52 Speaker 3\nYeah, I take one early morning, one late night. Yeah. So I have twice a day pills for anti seizure.\n00:14:00 Speaker 1\nOK. So doing an alarm.\n00:14:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, alarm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nAll right. And then. Are there other things for managing that? There's other aspects besides medication that you think for self-care that maybe you can have something, maybe Speaker 7 help manage?\n00:14:36 Speaker 3\nMaybe like I have like well alarms would be like you know I have physical therapy appointments or speech sessions like maybe I'll ask her to. Like makes me have like. A. A reminder like 30 minutes before or something cause like my PD clinic is like like a couple streets away from my house. So I need to like the little time to get ready.\n00:15:04\nYes.\n00:15:07 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. And then maybe if we're trying to come up with something for uh. Like maybe another thing to help with like if you have your medications for taking besides like just an alarm for time, we could have it set up something about the dosage instructions or potential side effects.\n00:15:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, I could just maybe ask her to do a reminder of like, UM. Check the like when we check the side of the bottle or something like that. So like they have a little medicine like like little fact sheet about what this is for. Yeah. Maybe like right, maybe about like 20 minutes before. I'm just taking this look, look at the side of the bottle or something like that.\n00:16:12 Speaker 1\nDo you is do you always take the same amount of the same medication?\n00:16:18 Speaker 3\nCurrently, but my neurologist, he said in like a week or two he's gonna, like, face out one and switch it with another. So I need to. I'm in like transition right now. So I'm it's like in the next couple weeks I'm going to like switch one out and get a new one.\n00:16:41 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.  So for that one, will the dosage change?\n00:16:48 Speaker 3\nWell, the dosages would change like one postman faced out and then one is building up this new one is. So this is will be going up.\n00:16:57 Speaker 1\nOK. Are you going to take it the same amount of times a day?\n00:17:02 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's both twice a day, but they're on the new pill is higher now and the I'm phasing out the old one that was on SO1 going up, one going down.\n00:17:16 Speaker 1\nAll right, so we could set up something that will because it's going to be a new dosage, maybe to remind you about what dosage to take possibly.\n00:17:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good reminder.\n00:17:33 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that you that could help you manage the medication or manage you know, other aspects of self-care? That we talked about.\n00:17:49 Speaker 3\nWell, I think that those are my 2. Issues in self-care right now, like with this weakness, weakness and like on my left side. But I wanna try to do my hair or put it in a ponytail or back behind my face like I'm trying to do it evenly. But this left side. Not always there. And then taking my daily medication, then sticking to this like the doses aren't supposed to be on right now. And also I'm I'm supposed to be doing daily stretches for my PT clinic to make my body open up. So I think they need to get reminders for that too.\n00:18:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, yeah, that would be great.\n00:18:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because I have a little packet. They gave me a little like, oh, do this one do this one they like. I'm supposed to actually do them. Speaker 7 reminds me of it. OK, you. Need to do it.\n00:18:51 Speaker 1\nSorry, I froze for a second, so I wasn't sure what happened. Go ahead, sorry.\n00:19:12 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's like it was. It was breathing for me. Breaking up for me a little bit. These are great. I just want to make sure we also ask. Sorry, I sorry, I missed the beginning. Have we asked Speaker 3 the goals yet or what her goal is or? Oh, we have, OK.\n00:19:36 Speaker 1\nWhat her goal is?\n00:19:38 Speaker 6\nSo. Yes, so we can. So, Speaker 3, what is your goal with Speaker 7? What do you hope to use Speaker 7 for?\n00:19:51 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm well. Currently I'm trying to do. I have my cell phone having alarms and daily planned activities like, you know, go to the USC election meeting it makes like a little noise and I need to have my Speaker 7 like back her up too or something. Ohh, go to your like tomorrow over at Chapman has Irvine campus. I live in Irvine so I go to PT over there, so about like. 45 minutes before. I just need to go get dressed, so maybe I can have Speaker 7 give me reminders and I'll I'll do this then.\n00:20:32 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:20:34 Speaker 3\nSo I just like how, UM, the Alex. I'm trying to use here right now. It's like I have my alarms and my reminders on my phone but need to have when you have two things telling you what to do is easier.\n00:20:49 Speaker 6\nYes, I think Speaker 7 is a great tool for you, especially when you're at home and it gives you that extra reminder to, you know, tie your hair or check. Yeah. Check. You know, 30 minutes before you have your PT session remind you to get ready. Like, oh, it's time to get ready. Yeah. OK.\n00:21:11 Speaker 3\nI need to get ready and leave. Yeah, because like you know, PT or a different album, there's like a speech that we can wear jeans and a top PD and wear your leggings and your hair in the back and the bun. And like, like fitness shoes. It's like it's different.\n00:21:29 Speaker 6\nTrue, right? OK reminders or?\n00:21:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because my different appointments are different.

I love that, good goals to work towards. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go back to the main room so we can learn some more skills about medication, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:25:23 Speaker 4\nAlright, if thank everyone's back, I'm going to share my screen again and we're going to practice a couple and then we'll go back into our breakout rooms. OK so. It's going to be a two-part command, but first we're going to use our Lexa to create a medication list for the sake of practicing as a group. We can do like a over the counter medication like by Advil or Tylenol as practice. So does anyone want to go first?\n00:26:09 Speaker 8\nWell, I can do it. Speaker 13. Give me a. Tell. Naproxen. Pill.\n00:26:25 Speaker 13\nAre you trying to shop for Naproxen pill?\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nYes.\n00:26:32 Speaker 13\nOne moment. Showing results from Naproxen Pill. The first one is Amazon Basic care back and muscle pain. Naproxen Sodium tablets, 220 milligrams, 90 count.\n00:26:50 Speaker 8\nOK, they. She wants me to pick up that naproxen pill, so that's good. I I can. Maybe I didn't. Tell our ask. Properly. I'll do it again.\n00:27:17 Speaker 4\nAnd Speaker 8, the there is an example on the right here. So say the wake up word and then create my medication list and then you could use that medication name you just mentioned.\n00:27:30 Speaker 8\nOK. Speaker 7. Create my. Medication list. And I want it. On. Not.\n00:27:46 Speaker 7\nCreate a list called medication right?\n00:27:51 Speaker 4\nIt picked up. Yep, he dropped it, picked up the first command. So we created the list. So now as a follow up you could add that name.\n00:27:51 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 7.\n00:28:01 Speaker 13\nRight.\n00:28:02 Speaker 8\nRight. Give me an aspirin. How's that?\n00:28:09 Speaker 13\nI've created medication list. What would you like to add to it?\n00:28:14 Speaker 8\nAspirin.\n00:28:17 Speaker 13\nI've added aspirin to your medication list. What else?\n00:28:26 Speaker 8\nCough drops.\n00:28:30 Speaker 13\nI've added cough drops to your medication list.

So it will ask those follow up questions just like that. And then how you responded when you added those specific examples? It's a great job, OK. Does anyone want to go next in creating their medication list?\n00:28:59 Speaker 2\nI will go. Speaker 14, create my medication list. Compounded hormones. Heart medication. Supplements. Sleep. I have all these medication profiles. Compounded hormones. R DHEA. Thyroid. Progesterone, estrogen cream, testosterone cream.\n00:29:43 Speaker 4\nDid did it pick up? The command did anything come up on the screen when you said that? OK, so how about first let's try that again. Let's first create that medication list.\n00:29:53 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, create my medication list.\n00:30:06 Speaker 14\nCreate a list called medication, right? Yes.

It has the same screen.\n00:31:18 Speaker 4\nYou could try that again. Say the wake up wake word and then say I'm all done. Maybe see if that.\n00:31:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, all done now.\n00:31:29 Speaker 14\nI'm not sure.\n00:31:32 Speaker 4\nOr how about?\n00:31:33 Speaker 2\nAll done now. Creating medication. Lists. Speaker 14's all done now.\n00:31:47 Speaker 14\nSorry, I'm not sure.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:31:51 Speaker 4\nOK, say the wake wake word again. Say go home.\n00:31:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, go home. It the screen turned off.\n00:32:06 Speaker 4\nDid it turn off? Yes. OK, so it's back. Do you see the main display again now? Yes, OK. Perfect.

Speaker 1, I can share my I can share the screen and then do you want to go ahead and? Should we go through the commands? So let me share my screen real quick. Oh.\n00:40:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, because I have the slides cause I.\n00:40:30 Speaker 6\nYou have the slides. Do you mind sharing? Can you share them? Because I don't have permission at the moment. Or I can ask Speaker 5.\n00:40:42 Speaker 1\nIt's saying that I can.\n00:40:45 Speaker 6\nOhh share screen OK. Yes you can. OK perfect.\n00:40:50 Speaker 6\nOK. \nAnd then I will note, oh, are you just OK?\n00:40:53 Speaker 1\nIt won't let me. Yeah, because I'm disabled too.\n00:40:58 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, if you're sending reminders, that's one of the things that you mentioned earlier, Speaker 3.\n00:41:09 Speaker 3\nThat to make it ohh I need this need to be ready for this in like 45 minutes or something to like flash on my screen. I'll need to get ready for PT or something.\n00:41:25 Speaker 6\nYes. Should we try that? Speaker 3, do you want to try that right now and set a a, maybe a reminder. So let's do. Do you want to do 30 minutes before your PT session?\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right, so. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder for 12:00 PM tomorrow for PT in an half hour?\n00:41:53 Speaker 7\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:41:56 Speaker 3\n12:00 PM.\n00:41:59 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at noon.\n00:42:04 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nAlright, I did it. Yeah, it says.\n00:42:09 Speaker 4\nNice.\n00:42:12 Speaker 3\nFriday, August 2nd at noon. So I have to get ready for. PC at that time.\n00:42:19 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:42:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:42:23 Speaker 6\nYeah. So the PT session starts at 12:30.\n00:42:26 Speaker 3\nWell, it's they want me there around like. So it actually starts at 12:45, but it's nice like they give myself 1/2 an hour to get ready and the only out of the door by 12:30. So like.\n00:42:39 Speaker 6\nOh. Ohh good.\n00:42:41 Speaker 3\nWhenever the you know the clinicians have to be there on time at to meet them at the door. So say I need a little time.\n00:42:48 Speaker 6\nYeah, good. I love how you already strategized and kind of gave yourself enough time to get ready and yeah, you.\n00:42:57 Speaker 3\nIt's good for me to plan. I need time for that. Customers like. Well PT like. You have to. Well, I try to look presentable because it's PT you wear, like your sweats and like, not really that attractive but like. I want to look like. You know, athleisure, it's like kind of like trendy workout plans, but but that is because they, they know that a team of clinicians are my peers. So I want to look fashionable in my own head.\n00:43:30 Speaker 6\nOhh yeah. Well, that's always. Yeah. I mean it's always, I mean you feel better too if you kind of like, yeah, absolutely.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's confidence. Yeah, I'm going to do this and like, I need half an hour to get ready.\n00:43:45 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know. Women, we need our time to get ready.\n00:43:51 Speaker 3\nIf you need your time and like you know, I have to put my hair up in a ponytail. That. Looks. No straight line behind my head because like you know, sometimes those PT clinicians comes and just put you on your back on the pad. It's like you wanna hang your hair out of the way?\n00:44:07 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. Speaker 3, I can see you already thinking about. Everything and you, you have all your outfits for different therapy sessions. I like that you're very organized. You're very.\n00:44:18 Speaker 3\nI'm really organized. I'm I'm a scientist, so I can think everything has to be. It's categorizing. Everything has a box to stick it.\n00:44:27 Speaker 6\nI love that. OK. All right. Let's go back to our slide. All right. I think we are on this one. OK. All right. Go ahead, Speaker 1, we can kind.\n00:44:44 Speaker 1\nOK, sure. So kind of like the the alarm you just set, this one's going to be specific for the medication like the medication you mentioned for that you take for seizures, yeah. So you can try that command. They wrote it up here and you can try it with that medication.\n00:45:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Speaker 7. Remind me to take Keppra at 7:00 AM.\n00:45:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that was good. That was like my morning dose. Yeah, it's on there, it says.\n00:45:35 Speaker 1\nOK, good. And you can do the same thing?\n00:45:38 Speaker 3\nFor the night dose, yeah. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder? For taking my my nightly medicine Keppra at 7:00 PM. 7:00 PM.\n00:46:03 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 7:00 PM.\n00:46:09 Speaker 3\nWell, it seems like she has both. Of them now.\n00:46:12 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great.\n00:46:15 Speaker 3\nYeah. If I say if I string it like word by word, she had to follow it like that.\n00:46:22 Speaker 1\nThat's OK. Yeah. Sometimes the way we say it, she'll she'll want us to say it in a specific way, but that's good. So now you two alarm set for every day.\n00:46:34 Speaker 3\nYeah, every day. Yeah.\n00:46:37 Speaker 1\nOK, great.\n00:46:38 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:43 Speaker 6\nShould we move on to the next one? Let's try this one.\n00:46:53 Speaker 1\nOK, so this one when we you need to find an over the counter medication so you can if you're trying to look for a specific medication, you can ask Speaker 7 where to find that medication so. What medication would you want to find?\n00:47:16 Speaker 3\nProbably would like to find like Tylenol like pain reliever like. Maybe I\u2019ll just command her.\n00:47:25 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:47:25 Speaker 3\nOh, OK, Speaker 7. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:47:34 Speaker 7\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy, who is 6 miles away on campus Drive and 1:50 right in. .7 miles away on Culver Drive, Urban Medical Center pharmacy 6.3 miles away on 7th Ave. St. 101 you can ask me for things like what's the address for the first one?\n00:48:04 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options where I can buy it.\n00:48:09 Speaker 6\nNice, I know. And she even read you the addresses.\n00:48:12 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's like, well, I've gone to that one before. It's like right down the street from my house.\n00:48:17 Speaker 6\nOh, good. She's pretty accurate, right? Yeah.\n00:48:21 Speaker 3\nI like how she's like spot on because like, my brain is analytical like that. So I can I like how she sticks to it.\n00:48:30 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK, great. Well, yeah that I think that's really helpful that way. You know if you know that you can't have to go to a close one, then she tells you how far it. Is so then you can the one that. It's close.\n00:48:50 Speaker 3\nOr like sometimes I go to like. I mean, I'm going to like a session now, I guess like my PT clinic is on the right and that one right there is on the route just to get it on the way or something like that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that would be super, super helpful.\n00:49:07 Speaker 3\nYou know, because like, well sometimes like. They make me work at PT, so maybe on the way back I need to get. Some Tylenol.\n00:49:18 Speaker 6\nNice.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nSo, Speaker 3, do you do your laundry?\n00:49:24 Speaker 3\nI do, but I I just took time. I've been right now I don't have a lot right now, but sometimes like, well, I have a little bin. If it's full, I can do one little. But it's only about like half full right now, so. I usually when my bin is full, I can stick it in. It's like 1 load per bin so.\n00:49:46 Speaker 1\nOK. Do you just wait till it gets full or do you do it? You know, once a week or once a month or.\n00:49:55 Speaker 3\nI usually rely on my bin like cause it's a size about like one load and usually I have. It's just like I usually label everything is like color like colors and cotton cause like it washes everything even though something so like. Different kinds of fabric. When you wash it all together, I have like a dyed a towel with a cut, cut, cut color in it. I have white underwear. They get dyed.\n00:50:30 Speaker 1\nSo do you read it?\n00:50:32 Speaker 3\nYes, and I use separate and then also I do my sheets once a month like the sheets in my bed. So I have to do that load by itself like with like a hot wash like hot temperature because like. It's cotton and it it kills like stuff on my bed and needs to get it. Clean.\n00:50:54 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, that's great. OK. So this one, the first step is how to do laundry. So I know you do your own laundry, but we can ask Speaker 7 and see how Speaker 7 says to do laundry.\n00:51:09 Speaker 3\nOK, I\u2019ll try. OK Speaker 7. How do I do my laundry? She gave me a couple. Then you click on or maybe select number one.\n00:51:32 Speaker 4\nThanks.\n00:51:37 Speaker 3\nOK, so Speaker 7 select number 1.\n00:51:44 Speaker 7\nFrom nearly dark 18. To give stretch things out of white clothing, use a one to one ratio of dish soap, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, and enough water to soak. A shallow bucket works well. Once the item is soaked for 30 minutes, washer is usually when you're ready to do laundry, zip it and tossing the load.\n00:52:11 Speaker 3\nWell, she just read to me about how to. Wash UM sweat stains out of UM like white clothing and using like a a combo of baking soda and and soap and hydrogen peroxide. Different like ratios and you say? Ohh stick it in.\n00:52:32 Speaker 1\nThat's really helpful.\n00:52:33 Speaker 3\nYou know, it's like, well, it's really I liked how it's really different like you know, when you have a scientific procedure different like it's like different parts of it like you have got the whole like procedures, then you have the the beginning, this and this and this it is scientific.\n00:52:59 Speaker 6\nI love that. It's all, it's all like analogy, right? They're all analogy, yeah.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nOK, so I was thinking that we could try to set a reminder for to do it at a specific time because you do your sheets once a month. Maybe you can have Speaker 7. You can pick a date and then just have Speaker 7 tell you on that date.\n00:53:30 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:53:33 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7. Can you set a reminder for me to do my laundry on August 15th?\n00:53:43 Speaker 7\nWhat time should I remind you?\n00:53:49 Speaker 3\n8:00 AM.\n00:53:51 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for August 15th at 8:00 AM.\n00:53:57 Speaker 3\nWell, she just made a reminder for me, she said. 8:00 AM on August. August 15th, halfway through the month, and. I have no appointments during that early morning time.\n00:54:13 Speaker 1\nOh, perfect.\n00:54:14 Speaker 3\nIt worked for my schedule.\n00:54:18 Speaker 1\nThat's great.\n00:54:22 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 3, on the Speaker 7 screen, does it say laundry as the name of the reminder or? Maybe you can ask Speaker 7 to. Show you your reminders. Alright? Yeah.\n00:54:43 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7, can you show me my reminders?\n00:54:55 Speaker 6\nDo you? Do you see one that says laundry on August 15th, or it's just a blank?\n00:55:00 Speaker 3\nIt's no, it's there's a bunch of them, so it says on August 15th. Do my laundry 8:00 AM and then. And. So every Thursday at like 520 prepare for Trojan space and then. Friday. Tomorrow it says. Half an hour PT, so it's 12:00 PM. Half an hour. That's like a reminder and then. I have my dosage. For taking my meds in the morning and night time, so I think there's about. Looks like there's about six things in the reminder list for me now. So I'm happy.\n00:56:00 Speaker 6\nThat's awesome. And you did them all. Yeah, I think you.\n00:56:05 Speaker 3\nWe may have a step by step. It's easier for me to think that way.\n00:56:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, you set them all up very nicely. Very good. OK, next one.\n00:56:18 Speaker 1\nOK, so we can do the stains out. You kind of did that one when you asked how they did the laundry, she kind of told you how to get. The stains out. Maybe we can try the one about fabric softener.\n00:56:40 Speaker 3\nUhm, OK, I'll try the command, OK. Hey. Speaker 7. When do I use fabric softener?\n00:56:59 Speaker 7\nEvery cycle, but it is usually recommended to use it every few washes.\n00:57:06 Speaker 3\nWow, she just told me that. It's used in every cycle or. Can we rotate it like recommended every two or? Every, every other wash and. Every like and as needed. So to add your fabric softener thing. It's like kind of your own choice you do you need it or you can just let it go.\n00:57:31 Speaker 1\nOh, OK. Do you use fabric softener?\n00:57:41 Speaker 3\nYes, if like the item we're trying to wash. Can be kind of like like stretched out. So I need to make it. So some things need to be a little crisp anywhere.\n00:57:57 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Let's try the next one. OK, so this one. So if your head's really hurting and you have a headache or a migraine. We can try to ask Speaker 7 how to how do we would treat that.\n00:58:20 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK, cool. Speaker 7, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:58:29 Speaker 7\nThere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for migraine food applying ice packs to the back of the head with temple taking and not taking a warm shower or bath inside, drinking water resting, and with physical therapy.\n00:58:52 Speaker 3\nOhh, she just read off things to do. You have migraine symptoms and different techniques you can do like put ice on the back of your neck or go to PT clinic and. Like soothe yourself.\n00:59:09 Speaker 1\nDo you ever get migraines?\n00:59:12 Speaker 3\nI actually do not get migraines.\n00:59:15 Speaker 1\nOK, good.\n00:59:17 Speaker 3\nBut some people do. It's like a lot of people.\n00:59:21 Speaker 1\nYeah, those are good ways to help if you if you do get migraines. But even if you get a headache they might help.\n00:59:26 Speaker 3\nYeah, like it's good to like. Like sometimes you just want to like, listen to some chill music and just. Check out.\n00:59:39 Speaker 5\nYeah, that could help too.\n00:59:41 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like when they're doing a lot of other things with my day, sometimes you have to take a break.\n00:59:50 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's really helpful. OK. Should we try another one? OK, this one's for stomach pains, OK.\n00:59:58 Speaker 3\nI'll try, OK. Speaker 7. What do I take for stomach pains?\n01:00:08 Speaker 7\nI don't know that one.\n01:00:12 Speaker 3\nHe just said. I don't know that one.\n01:00:20 Speaker 1\nWell, let's see. So what? What is something we could take for stomach pain? There's medicine like.\n01:00:31 Speaker 3\nLike anti acid or something like that like so everyone has different pains.\n01:00:38 Speaker 1\nI think wasn't there when you put on your medication list.\n01:00:41 Speaker 3\nOhh, like Tylenol? Like a pain med.\n01:00:45 Speaker 7\nInteractive adventures with character.\n01:00:47 Speaker 1\nOr Pepto bismol.\n01:00:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, Pepto bismol.\n01:00:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, that I think might have been on that list too. So we could read the list off of like medications that you would take. Help remember.\n01:01:06 Speaker 3\nYeah. Speaker 7, can you read me my medication list?\n01:01:19 Speaker 7\nI don't know.\n01:01:21 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just read it to me. Pepto Bismol and Tylenol.\n01:01:29 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.\n01:01:31 Speaker 3\nShe she read it.\n01:01:34 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Should we try one more?\n01:01:41 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n01:01:43 Speaker 1\nOK, so for this one it says finding a specific healthcare provider, so we could probably tell Speaker 7 what kind of doctor give a like, what kind of doctor would you want to find?\n01:01:56 Speaker 3\nI'm probably a good dentist, so you specific Doctor. OK, I command her OK. Speaker 7. Find me a dentist.\n01:02:13 Speaker 7\nFound a few options for them. It was Spring Hills Dentistry 5.6 miles away on Newport, Dr. Irving Children's Dentistry 2.7 miles away on Culver, Dr. E University Park Dental 4.1 miles away on university.\n01:02:35 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options for different choices for dental care in my area. Even though I think my dentist is farther farther away but it's just good to read those options to.\n01:02:49 Speaker 1\nYeah. And I think if you asked her again, she could like to find more. She could umm, search, search for more. Yeah. Or if you, I think search for your dentist. She could probably tell you where that is too.\n01:03:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. We will try to ask. Speaker 7. Can you? Look for Irvine dental.\n01:03:20 Speaker 7\nFound in Irvine Dental. Irvine Dental was 4.8 miles away.\n01:03:25 Speaker 3\nI just found it.\n01:03:29 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just wrote me the address and. It just said it's currently closed because it actually stops at six and it says, well, it gave me the address and the suite where it's at so. I go there sometimes, like every couple months, so if I need to like check up or. I have a cavity. I don't like that, but it sends you to get it pulled. \n01:03:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense. Well, that's great. And next time you go, maybe you can use Speaker 7 to help with the address and have the address\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like, well, when my mom drives somewhere, I can just plug it into her like. She puts her little. Map thing and Google Maps and just type in the address and go.\n01:04:22 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's great.\n01:04:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n01:04:37 Speaker 6\nThose are all the commands. And Speaker 3, you did them with 100% accuracy, so that was great.\n01:04:43 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n01:04:51 Speaker 6\nOK, I think we are good to go back to the main room. OK, OK.\n01:05:02 Speaker 5\nOK, I'm going to stop the breaker room. Good job. Nice work, Speaker 3. I really feel like you can utilize this on top of everything that you've been using.\n01:05:13 Speaker 3\nI have my phone alarms and now have my Speaker 7 back it up, yeah.\n01:05:19 Speaker 5\nFeel free to pick your preferred ones because we don't want you to fully cover and drop what you've been doing. OK? Yeah, just pick what's easy for you.\n01:05:21 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:05:34 Speaker 5\nHi everyone.\n01:05:42 Speaker 5\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will. Be oh, I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slides a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So I expect another homework for this week on self-care information. Just just to double check, did you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two? You got all the slides. I know, Speaker 8. You got it, Speaker 10. You got it. OK, Speaker 2, you got it too.\n01:06:21 Speaker 8\nYep.\n01:06:25 Speaker 2\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n01:06:34 Speaker 5\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Laura, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our PowerPoint train. OK, so after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be any time, but if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd the. So think week six if you go by numbers in your head. Week six, we would like to hear from you just. We will ask you some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well. You can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share together because. Chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel feel free to bring them as well. And I will send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n01:08:17 Speaker 8\nOK.\n01:08:18 Speaker 7\nAny questions?\n01:08:20 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8, we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 8, if you still wanted to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and then we'll let you go. I promise.\n01:08:32 Speaker 5\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can be brief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday. Bye.\n01:08:52 Speaker 9\nAll right, Speaker 8, I'm going to open the breakout.\n01:08:54 Speaker 5\nRoom. OK. Oh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 8 and Speaker 11 and Speaker 12 can go. And don't forget to record.\n01:09:04 Speaker 6\nOK.\n01:09:06 Speaker 8\nYou want me to join or not?\n01:09:08 Speaker 5\nYes, Speaker 8, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going to change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Speaker 16.\n01:09:30 Speaker 6\nYay, great job. OK, stop.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  The provided text discusses the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, a widely used method of documentation in healthcare that helps structure and organize information for healthcare providers.\n\nThe SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record. The four headings of a SOAP note are:\n\n1. Subjective - This section documents the patient's personal views or feelings about their condition, known as the chief complaint (CC) and history of present illness (HPI). It also includes medical, surgical, family, social history, and review of systems (ROS).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes the subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including any necessary medications, specialist referrals or consults, and patient education.\n\nThe text also discusses issues of concern regarding the SOAP note, such as its inability to document changes over time and the potential for data-filled notes to burden healthcare providers if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy-to-find places, making it easier for clinicians to follow. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT:  To enhance the quality of the response, the language model could focus on providing more detailed information about the importance and benefits of organizing information in a SOAP note using easy-to-find places. This would help clinicians follow the patient's progress better, as well as make it easier for them to extract relevant data quickly during their busy schedules.\n\nAdditionally, the response could highlight the history of the SOAP note and its inventor, Dr. Larry Weed, stressing its significance as a cognitive aid and potential index for learning from medical records. This would give readers a deeper understanding of why it is important to structure patient information in this manner.\n\nLastly, the language model could offer suggestions for best practices when creating SOAP notes, such as using clear and concise language, providing relevant medical history and family background, thoroughly documenting physical exam findings, and listing problems and differential diagnoses accurately. These tips would help clinicians create more useful and effective SOAP notes for both their own purposes and to share with colleagues or other healthcare professionals.\n\nBy including these suggestions, the response from the language model would not only provide a summary of the patient's progress and needs but also educate readers on the importance and benefits of using a well-structured SOAP note. This would improve the overall quality and usefulness of the notes for both clinicians and patients alike. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation. Specifically, give feedback to the following span of text:\n\n<VARIABLE> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a (...) note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </VARIABLE>\n\nGiven the above history, describe how the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses could be improved to improve the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>.

This can be achieved by expanding on the benefits of using a well-organized SOAP note:\n\n1. Enhance Clinical Decision Making: A well-structured SOAP note allows healthcare providers to quickly access relevant information about a patient's medical history, symptoms, physical examination findings, and tests results. This makes it easier for clinicians to make informed decisions about diagnosis, treatment plans, and referrals, ultimately improving the quality of care for patients.\n\n2. Facilitate Collaboration: A clear and organized SOAP note enables other healthcare professionals, such as specialists or consultants, to easily understand a patient's medical history and current status. This facilitates seamless collaboration between clinicians, ensuring that all relevant information is shared accurately and efficiently, ultimately benefiting the patient.\n\n3. Improve Learning Opportunities: A well-documented SOAP note serves as an essential educational resource for medical students, residents, and other healthcare professionals. It provides a detailed account of a patient's presentation, diagnostic process, treatment plan, and follow-up care, offering valuable insights into the practice of medicine and promoting ongoing learning and professional development.\n\n4. Promote Efficiency: By organizing information in a SOAP note, clinicians can quickly find relevant data during their busy schedules, reducing the time spent searching for information and improving overall efficiency. This ensures that patients receive timely and effective care while minimizing delays or oversights in diagnosis or treatment.\n\nBy emphasizing these benefits of using a well-structured SOAP note, the system prompt can help guide the language model to provide a more informative and educational response that highlights the importance of organizing patient information effectively.

This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file  Session 4 M.A. (Self care) 7-17-2025.m4a    Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  And then. Yeah, yeah. I just start to record.  Thank you. Thank you.  All right. So all right, M, let's get started. Tell me, how was your time at the beach? What did you do?  00:00:15 Speaker 2  That's fun.  00:00:17 Speaker 3  What did you? Just.  00:00:19 Speaker 2  No, me and my. Mom just went for a little while.  00:00:22 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:00:23 Speaker 2  We took our dog Roxy.  00:00:25 Speaker 4  OK.  00:00:27 Speaker 2  We didn't take her dog off, she but.  We should have.  00:00:32 Speaker 1  Yeah. Did you hear more dogs there on the beach?  00:00:36 Speaker 2  Yeah, there are a lot of dogs on the beach.  00:00:39 Speaker 1  OK. M, do you hope your parents take? Care of the dog.   00:00:47 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:00:47 Speaker 1  Do you do anything for him or her?  00:00:50 Speaker 2  For her.  00:00:52 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:00:53 Speaker 2  I do.  00:00:54 Speaker 1  Oh, OK. And what kind of things? Do you do?  00:00:58 Speaker 2  Nothing much.  00:01:00  All right.  00:01:00 Speaker 3  What do you do for Roxy when she growls at the door? Do you do anything? No. Do you ignore? Her. Or do you?  00:01:08 Speaker 2  Yeah, just in there.  00:01:09 Speaker 3  Let her outside. M, do you let her? Outside.  00:01:14 Speaker 2  Outside.  00:01:16 Speaker 3  OK. Is she? And when do you?  Let her in. Yep.  00:01:20 Speaker 1  OK. OK, that's good. Is there anything else that you that that you like to do like some kind of care that you like to provide for your dog and help help Mom and Dad with it?  00:01:34 Speaker 2  I like to fill up a bowl of water.  00:01:37 Speaker 1  OK, alright, that's great. How often do you have to do that?  00:01:43 Speaker 2  Once a day.  00:01:45 Speaker 3  OK.  00:01:49 Speaker 1  All right, I'm going to share my screen and today we are going to talk about self-care and medical needs. The the reason I was asking questions about Roxy, I did not know you had a dog. And then also if there are things that. That would help you ask. I mean, if you wanted to ask Gemini about caring for your dog, you know and and helping helping Mom and Dad with it or something that you could do that would be very nice. What do you think?  00:02:18 Speaker 2  Would be.  00:02:20 Speaker 1  Yeah. Would that be useful to you?  OK, alright, let's get started and see. What we can, what kind of? Questions we can ask and what kind of commands we can. Share. Right.  OK. Can you see my?  00:02:36 Speaker 3  Screen. Yes, we can. OK.  00:02:39 Speaker 1  All right, so. Self-care and M needs. I think you're pretty familiar with that from last year and we talked about medication management, searching for laundry and self-care, tips, tips to improve physical and mental health. And searching for some home remedies, if you if you had some health. Problems and searching for a nearby doctor. So with Alexa we were able to do many of these, but we're going to see how different those two are going to be like if you were to ask Alexa and if you were to ask Gemini. So what we could do, do you have your? Alexa anywhere.  00:03:25 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's behind.  00:03:26 Speaker 1  Yeah. Ohh OK. So it's still it's on, right?  00:03:26 Speaker 2  Us.  00:03:29 Speaker 1  It will still give. You information if you had, if you had to use. What?  00:03:33 Speaker 3  Yes it is.  00:03:35 Speaker 1  All right. And do do you happen to have it on your phone at all? I mean, you can use that too. If you wanted to practice, actually it's.  00:03:43 Speaker 3  It is on M's phone, but his phone is having an issue, but it's on the iPad and I.  00:03:47 Speaker 1  Have the iPad right. OK. Yeah, that's good, too. So I I wanted to for some of those commands. Where?  We're looking for location specific details or a time specific details where you are you know. I think you know setting up a reminder or like an event, then we want to see and use Alexa as well like to see what the difference is, we're going to see if that makes any difference and which one is better, OK. Alright, OK, let's see. Right. Uh, let's see. So some help managing medications.  We did this with Alexa last year, M. It's about creating a medication list and then showing your medication list. So let's see if it will let you create a medication list on your on Gemini first. We know that Alexa does it pretty well, but let's start with Gemini and this one.  And and see how how that goes.  00:04:53  Thanks.  00:04:53 Speaker 1  So.  00:04:54 Speaker 3  Is the Gemini live or just Gemini?  00:04:59 Speaker 1  It's up to you. I I think you said in the e-mail that the live worked when and then he could use it with his voice, right? Yeah.  00:05:08 Speaker 3  Yes. Where when you use the regular Gemini, you have to touch your microphone and then you have to find the spot to turn it off the stop.  00:05:17 Speaker 1  Turn it off where is.  00:05:19 Speaker 3  His life. Right. You don't have to do that. It's your voice. And then you just touch the screen.  00:05:24 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK. Yeah, sure. So for sure. Yeah, let's do it live. If it because that that way he can be more independent with, you know, working on those commands.  00:05:35 Speaker 3  You're just gonna use my phone, M to experiment.  00:05:36 Speaker 2  OK.  00:05:41 Speaker 5  OK, I'm ready when you are. What would you like me to do?  00:05:44 Speaker 2  Making medications for me.  00:05:48 Speaker 5  So I can't use reminders yet when we.  Are live for. Now going live is great for things like chatting, finding answers, or brainstorming new ideas.  00:05:57 Speaker 3  Did you hear? That.  00:05:58 Speaker 1  So what did it say? Uh, it cannot use it. It cannot.  00:06:01 Speaker 3  It cannot make a medication list going live yet it's great for getting what was the other thing it said notification and.  00:06:09 Speaker 2  Notification.  00:06:13 Speaker 3  Reminder and remind no, it wasn't reminders. I should have had.  00:06:18 Speaker 1  It OK, I have it in the chat in. Case do you do you want to just?  Try it on Alexa maybe.  00:06:27 Speaker 3  OK. Or I can go to the. Other one and also.  00:06:30 Speaker 5  Control other apps yet when?  00:06:31 Speaker 1  We are live. Let's let's try. Let's try Alexa, because I think that's as effective when it comes to making lists. And you know, creating lists and showing those or reading those lists stuff. So. So let's just practice that those kind of. You know, commands on on there, whichever, because I feel like whichever he can do on his own independently, those we can, you know, test on Gemini. But others like I think maybe we can we can try Alexa.  00:07:03 Speaker 3  OK. Yeah. To talk to. You're going to use A to make a list medication.  00:07:11 Speaker 4  List no, no.  00:07:13 Speaker 2  Open the Alexa app.  00:07:16 Speaker 3  Huh.  00:07:17 Speaker 4  OK, go ahead.  00:07:21 Speaker 3  It's open. Just make your list M.  It's open.  00:07:31 Speaker 2  Hey, Alexa.  00:07:37 Speaker 4  Go ahead.  00:07:41 Speaker 3  Make a medication.  00:07:42 Speaker 2  Make a medication list.  00:07:50 Speaker 3  No. Try again, M.  00:07:52 Speaker 2  Yeah, let's make a medication list.  00:07:59 Speaker 3  It could be using your device.  00:08:04 Speaker 2  Yeah, let's make a medication list. Sermon.  00:08:13 Speaker 3  Let me just put it over here.  00:08:18 Speaker 1  OK. M, have you tried making medication lists on with your with your glasses at all?  00:08:26 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:08:28 Speaker 1  OK. And does how how is? That and does that help you more? Yeah. OK. You can try that too, either 1 whichever 1 you prefer. If you prefer Alexa, we can try on that. Or we can try it on on your on your glasses.  00:08:46 Speaker 2  OK.  00:08:47 Speaker 3  Try.  00:08:48 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, make a medication this.  00:08:55 Speaker 3  You know what, M? You'll have to.  00:08:58 Speaker 4  Could I ask you?  00:09:02 Speaker 2  A medication called Trazodone.  00:09:07 Speaker 4  I've added medication called.  00:09:12 Speaker 2  Mark 2. As the Mac tool.  00:09:25 Speaker 4  What other items you want?  00:09:27 Speaker 2  The Mac too.  00:09:34 Speaker 1  No.  00:09:34 Speaker 4  You have.  00:09:37  It's.  00:09:37 Speaker 4  What?  00:09:38 Speaker 3  What's happening is with the glasses when he talks, you guys can't hear because it's going through his glasses and the one that's talking is the actual device that's behind him. So.  00:09:52  Garment.  00:09:52 Speaker 3  Take it off.  00:09:55 Speaker 1  Ohh, I'm so sorry.  00:09:57 Speaker 3  But you're you're worthless. It made the. So on the main device.  00:10:01 Speaker 1  OK, perfect. It did make the list OK. Alright, that's good. But I mean we can also, you know use whichever 1 is more convenient because you M, you wear your glasses almost all all the time. Now I think you're so much more used to it. So we can, you know, do these commands using your glasses. Because I I think the two things together, it's it's becoming very difficult and challenging. So that's fine, you know, but for this next one, since it made the medication list already on Alexa, let's just try this next one on Alexa. But the next few ones, whichever Gemini live cannot be used for, we can try his glasses. Let's try. It OK? Yeah, that would be good. OK.  So M, the next command we have here is show your medication. Show me my medication list.  00:10:58 Speaker 2  Yeah, Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:08 Speaker 3  So.  00:11:09 Speaker 2  Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:17 Speaker 3  No, I think you have.  00:11:18 Speaker 2  To say Alexa, show me my medication list.  00:11:25 Speaker 3  She was the lines moving, but I think he's just a touched ohh. She did. She did.  00:11:31 Speaker 1  She did get it. OK. All right. On the on the iPad. OK.  00:11:35 Speaker 3  Medication called Trazodone. You've got Robitussin Tylenol cough drops and neosporin. No.  00:11:42 Speaker 2  OK. You're welcome.  00:11:44 Speaker 1  Did you did you Add all of them right now or was it only the Trazodone that he was trying to add?  00:11:53 Speaker 3  Right. The Trazodone tonight and the other ones were there from before.  00:11:58 Speaker 1  From before. OK, OK. Alright, M. When when you've used to manage medications, if you've used your glasses, do you check those medications off once you have received those medications? Or just leave them on the on the. List what do you do?  00:12:23 Speaker 2  I try to check them off, but if if I if I don't remember then they stay on.  00:12:27 Speaker 1  Then it stays on. OK got it. Right, that's that's why maybe from that that was the list from the previous times. Got it. OK. All right, so the next.  00:12:41 Speaker 3  Remember when we say show me, it shows it, it doesn't read.  00:12:46 Speaker 1  Right, it does not read it, yeah. That is, that is a that is. A drawback from Alexa I remember I I think from last time. So I think show and read me my medication list might be a better command for you M. So that yeah, it makes. OK. All right, let's try to find some over the counter medications, OK. Let's see. Alright, so the next command. Can you put your glasses back on and let's let's try it with the glasses because I think.  You use those more than. Your Alexa app.  00:13:31 Speaker 2  OK.  00:13:32 Speaker 1  OK, So what medication would you like to find if if you, if you wanted to know something or if you're curious about finding a medication?  00:13:42 Speaker 2  M.  00:13:45 Speaker 3  An over the counter, one not a prescription.  00:13:48 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:13:50 Speaker 3  Something over the counter. OK.  00:13:55 Speaker 2  Ibuprofen.  00:13:56 Speaker 1  OK, ibuprofen. So let's ask the command, let's do this command. Where do I find ibuprofen?  00:14:04 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, where do I find ibuprofen?  00:14:08 Speaker 1  OK.  00:14:12 Speaker 4  CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away.  00:14:17 Speaker 1  It's the device at the back that's talking correct. OK, that worked OK.  00:14:20  Yeah.  00:14:23 Speaker 1  How about let's compare the responses now, so that gave you some information. I couldn't hear that, but was that accurate like? So was it closed like the pharmacies or something?  00:14:35 Speaker 3  And. It listed pharmacies that are very close to our homes and the address.  00:14:36 Speaker 1  OK. Got it.  Which we're the address. OK, M, let's try that same command on with your glasses. So with meta.  00:14:52 Speaker 2  The matter?  In Maida. Where can I find ibuprofen?  00:15:10 Speaker 3  What did he say?  00:15:11 Speaker 2  Targets CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.  00:15:13 Speaker 1  OK. Was it listing the addresses as? Well.  00:15:17 Speaker 2  No.  00:15:18 Speaker 1  No. OK. So that's the difference. It's not giving a location for those pharmacies, it's it's just listing like regular pharmacies where you could find like or regular stores where you could find them.  00:15:32 Speaker 4  Yep.  00:15:33 Speaker 1  OK, alright.  00:15:34 Speaker 3  Should he try Gemini?  00:15:38 Speaker 1  We can try. Yeah, for sure. Let's let's give it a go.  00:15:42 Speaker 3  House.  00:15:44 Speaker 2  Hey, Jim and I are working to find ibuprofen.  00:15:50 Speaker 5  I couldn't find any stores that sell ibuprofen nearby. You could try searching online to see what's available.  00:15:56 Speaker 1  Hmm. OK, so location specific details are are the best like using Alexa I guess.  00:16:05 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:16:06 Speaker 1  Yeah, or maybe Siri. That would be similar, I guess, but uh, more or less. One of those tools rather than anything. Which is run within all the large language model I guess or an AI.  00:16:21 Speaker 3  What do you wanna know what Siri says?  00:16:25 Speaker 1  Sure.  00:16:26 Speaker 3  Oh yes.  00:16:27 Speaker 2  Hey Siri, where can I find ibuprofen?  00:16:33  I don't know where you are.  00:16:36 Speaker 2  Said I don't know where you are. XXXX(Address).  00:16:37 Speaker 3  Tell her where you are.  Oh, she didn't care.  00:16:46 Speaker 2  XXXX(Address)  00:16:48 Speaker 3  Have to wake her up.  00:16:50 Speaker 2  He's stirring. Hey Siri. XXXX(Address). Where do I find ibuprofen?  00:17:03 Speaker 4  You're welcome.  00:17:08 Speaker 3  Should we lost her? So. Try again to saying where do I find ibuprofen?  00:17:16 Speaker 2  Siri, where do I find you, Siri? Where do I find ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga?  00:17:23 Speaker 5  They don't seem to be able to get your current location.  00:17:27 Speaker 1  Is is the location on on this phone.  00:17:31 Speaker 3  It's. For sharing.  It should be, you know.  00:17:34 Speaker 1  That's so odd. Usually it's it's so good at picking up location if it's a phone, but.  00:17:40 Speaker 3  So.  00:17:41 Speaker 2  Siri, where do I find ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga?  00:17:47  I don't know where you are.  00:17:49 Speaker 5  OK, I found this on the web for ibuprofen in Rancho Cucamonga.  00:17:53  Check it out.  00:17:56 Speaker 3  And that's where Siri is the downfall. It she'll tell you where she found it, but you have to be able to see what she all.  00:17:56  1st.  00:18:05 Speaker 3  Oh, not read it aloud to you.  00:18:08 Speaker 1  Ohh got it. So I wonder if maybe we might have to add.  Like list those.  00:18:18 Speaker 3  Or.  00:18:21 Speaker 1  Yeah, that's that's tough, I know.  00:18:23 Speaker 3  That's the serious issue, but.  The Alexa. Tells you the name of the place and an address, yeah. And Gemini and Maida just tells you the name of the stores.  00:18:39 Speaker 1  Right.  00:18:40 Speaker 3  And.  00:18:40 Speaker 1  I think.  00:18:42 Speaker 3  Gemini is very limited.  00:18:44 Speaker 1  Yeah, I think if we, if we probably gave Gemini like in advance we said that this is my address and then ask.  Where can I find ibuprofen? It probably might work, but again, I'm not sure.  00:19:02 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:19:03 Speaker 1  Yeah, yeah, but that's again a lot of commands. I feel like it it has to be simple enough. And the best part about Alexa is that he can use his glasses to turn like, you know, turn on Alexa on his, like, the app on his phone or the iPad. And then he can say the command. So that makes it much easier to navigate. And seeing less number of words and comments.  00:19:30 Speaker 3  Very much.  It's the same as when you're in the actual store. He's wearing the glasses and he's asking.  A what's on my list grocery list. And she will tell him and he'll say check off tomatoes, whatever it is. And when you're in a store, it's coming. It's very indiscreet because it's coming. He only he really hears the voice. And so it's very discreet.  00:19:44 Speaker 1  MHM.  00:20:03 Speaker 3  Correct.  00:20:05 Speaker 1  Though that he has those now, I I think I think that's making it so much easier for him to navigate. M, are you enjoying those? Because it makes you. How does that make you feel?  00:20:06  Yeah.  00:20:18 Speaker 2  They make me feel good, they play music and they make me feel.  Secure.  00:20:26 Speaker 1  That's good. OK.  That's amazing. All right, let's move on. Alright so.  Here we have. Learning to do laundry, but we can do something else. Is there something else related to self-care or caring for your dog?  That.  A kind of question you might want to ask which could be, yeah, anything related to your care, your family's care, self-care, or your dogs, you know well-being.  Anything, anything of that sort that you would like to ask?  00:21:08 Speaker 2  And.  00:21:10 Speaker 1  OK, what can you think of?  00:21:15 Speaker 2  And said to a.  00:21:19 Speaker 3  Well, don't tell Priel first.  00:21:22 Speaker 2  Trial. Alright. Hey, Creole, can I say to Alex?  00:21:28 Speaker 1  OK, uh, what? What would you like to ask though?  00:21:34 Speaker 2  When can I feed my dog or no? My dog drink water?  00:21:40 Speaker 1  When can my dog dog drink?  Water. Is that what you said?  00:21:43 Speaker 2  Yeah, one kind of allow my dog to drink.  Water. OK. Yeah, sure. Hey, Alex.  I'm trying to allow my dog to drink water.  00:21:53 Speaker 4  Something.  00:22:02 Speaker 2  It's in the com reference.com puppies could start drinking water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:09 Speaker 1  Sorry, I can't hear you. What? What did. What did you say?  00:22:12 Speaker 3  Say it louder, M.  00:22:14 Speaker 2  She said here's something from here's something I found on reference.com. It's.  Puppies are allowed to drink water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:26 Speaker 1  OK.  00:22:26 Speaker 3  They can drink water when they're three weeks old.  00:22:28 Speaker 1  When they're three weeks old, OK, was.  Does that answer your question?  Or do we need to? Did you mean that how many times a day or?  00:22:38 Speaker 2  How many times a day?  00:22:39 Speaker 3  What are?  00:22:40 Speaker 1  The indications for me to give my dog water or something like that.  00:22:46 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, what are the indications for me to get my dog water?  I think she heard me, but she shut off.  00:23:00 Speaker 3  Say it louder, my.  00:23:01 Speaker 2  Hey, Alexa, what are the indications to get my dog drink water?  00:23:08 Speaker 4  There's something I found on you get your dog to make sure there's constant access. And. Chicken broth.  00:23:35 Speaker 3  Lot of information, lot of information.  00:23:36 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:23:40 Speaker 1  Could you process and like? Could? Could you remember any of the details that it just said? No, it was a lot.  00:23:48 Speaker 3  What were some of the details, M?  00:23:49 Speaker 2  The dog.  Small amounts of urine.  Take her to the hospital or the vet.  00:23:56 Speaker 1  OK.  00:23:57 Speaker 2  But the. Excuse me.  00:24:05 Speaker 1  You're OK? No worries.  00:24:08 Speaker 3  What else did she say?  00:24:10 Speaker 2  He said. I don't know. I can't remember.  00:24:17 Speaker 3  Did she say to put one bowl of water out or lots of multiple bowls of water?  00:24:22 Speaker 1  Multiple bowls of water.  Do you do that for Roxy? No. Maybe she does she.  Know, though, that that's where she drinks water.  Probably does. Yeah. All right. Do you want to try that same command for Gemini? Maybe because that would, I think that kind of question we could try live with with Gemini and see if that would give some similar or different information. Let's try.  00:24:54 Speaker 2  Hey, Jim and I, where can I? When can I allow my dog to drink water?  00:25:00 Speaker 5  If your dog just had surgery, it's best to check with your vet about when they can have water. Usually they'll say to wait a couple of hours and give them just a little at first. If your dog hasn't had surgery, then they can have water whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:13 Speaker 1  OK, that was pretty good.  00:25:17 Speaker 2  And then when whenever when is whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:18 Speaker 1  I've got.  00:25:25 Speaker 5  That's right. Dogs can drink water whenever they seem thirsty.  00:25:31 Speaker 1  OK.  00:25:31 Speaker 2  Probably seem thirsty, Gemini.  00:25:35 Speaker 5  If your dog is panting a lot, drooling, or has dry looking gums, they might be thirsty. Sometimes they'll also lick their lips or look for their water bowl.  00:25:45 Speaker 1  That's amazing, M. I loved that you could ask a follow up question like that. That's amazing.  00:25:52 Speaker 2  Thank you.  00:25:53 Speaker 1  Yeah, but, and that was really good information according to me. What did. What did you think, M?  00:26:00 Speaker 2  I thought so too.  00:26:01 Speaker 1  Yeah, that was short and to the point and it gave you whatever you needed, I guess.  Did that answer your question?  00:26:09 Speaker 2  Yeah, it did.  00:26:10 Speaker 1  OK, alright, that's great. Now let's go. Let's move on.  Alright, so there are more questions about how to OK, this was all about the laundry that we talked last time. Let's try one of these. So getting so this is about getting stains out of clothes. So do you want to ask Gemini?  What do I use to get get stains out of my clothes?  00:26:40 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini.  When can I get? Where do I get or what do I use to get stains out of my clothes?  00:26:49 Speaker 5  There are lots of things you can use to get stains out of clothes. It kind of depends on what kind of stain it is. Do you know what stains your clothes?  00:26:56 Speaker 2  Bleach.  00:27:00  Did you say bleep?  00:27:01 Speaker 5  OK, for bleach stains, you'll want to use something.  00:27:05  Sorry.  00:27:06 Speaker 5  Yes, I can still hear you.  No worries. Take your time.  00:27:12 Speaker 2  Tomatoes.  Tomato juice.  00:27:20 Speaker 5  Tomato juice stains can be a bit tricky. First, try blotting up as much of the juice as you can, then rinse the stain in cold water. If it's still there, try rubbing some dish soap into the stain and washing.  It again OK.  00:27:33 Speaker 3  OK, what I what I noticed is M's.  00:27:35 Speaker 5  OK, got it.  00:27:40 Speaker 3  Didn't have a concise question to begin with.  He said what I mean where I mean and she still answered the question. Yes, that is the difference between, I guess the two systems, right? Absolutely.  It's.  00:27:58 Speaker 1  Even if there is some hesitation to begin with or during the question or the command, it will still. So take the.  Question in a context. So it kind of.  Understands the OR like you know, understands the context I could.  Say.  And then answers that question. So that is that is a good thing about using these AI tools, I guess.  00:28:25 Speaker 3  And that's a little bit more superior to Siri.  Because she's more literal.  And Alexa is kind of not as literal as Siri, but a little bit. Gemini is more forgiving.  00:28:33 Speaker 4  Mm-hmm.  00:28:45 Speaker 3  Of the three.  00:28:46 Speaker 1  I think. Ohh yeah, yeah.  When you ask if you do, you have you had any?  Success with using the glasses to ask questions like this, like for information related to self-care.  00:29:05 Speaker 2  And for the most part.  00:29:06 Speaker 3  Do you want to try the same question here you guys?  00:29:11 Speaker 1  So the question is, what do I use to get stains out of my clothes?  00:29:17 Speaker 2  In meta.  What do I use to get stains?  In my clothes.  What if my stainless bleeps?  Cherries and sour Oxiclean, or take it to a professional cleaner.  00:29:51 Speaker 3  OK.  00:29:51  Try.  00:29:52 Speaker 1  Take it to the professional cleaners and.  00:29:54 Speaker 3  It said try shout or Oxiclean or you could try taking it to a.  00:29:59 Speaker 1  Professional. Cleaner. OK, alright. I mean that seems like valid information to me. I'm not sure but but it does. Yeah, I mean.  That's comparable to what? Gemini offered, I guess like it was short. But and to the.  Point, but still gave all the details that you needed for.  I think.  00:30:22 Speaker 3  Yes, I think the key for both Maida and Gemini.  Your follow up question has to be relatively quick. You can't at too much time pass before asking that follow up or it's too late.  00:30:38 Speaker 1  Bing.  Yeah. Otherwise I think the system times out and then you might.  Have to start again.  00:30:45 Speaker 3  Yes. And so that's what M's been working on is follow up questions like this.  00:30:52 Speaker 1  Yeah. Yeah. But I think there I feel like there's such a change from the previous year to this year, just in conversation. I feel, M, I think you're doing really great, has been a good, good amount of progress that I can see from last summer to this summer.  Yes, when it comes to just conversational. And everything I think you know and I. Think the glasses are?  Great. I think they're helping a lot too. And of course, this year and if everything together, I think the therapies and all of that together.  00:31:25 Speaker 3  Definitely.  00:31:32 Speaker 1  OK. Let's see how many we have 5 minutes. OK. All right. M, anything related to self-care that you can think of that you would still want to ask Gemini or Alexa or your glasses? No, you can you can you practice a couple more commands.  00:31:53 Speaker 2  Yep.  00:31:55 Speaker 1  OK. All right, let's see. So I think with finding a doctor, it will again be the best. If we tried with Alexa because.  It's going to it's location specific information so.  We can try.  Let's try Alexa.  For finding a type of doctor, maybe. Let's let's see. Could do you think, uh, what kind of doctor would you like to find?  00:32:33 Speaker 2  Physical therapist.  00:32:36 Speaker 1  OK, let's try with Alexa first.  And then Gemini, let's see if that would.  00:32:44 Speaker 2  Hey Alexa, find me a physical therapist.  00:32:50 Speaker 4  We found a few options for that.  Physical therapy 3.1 miles away from Rochester Ave. 3 miles away. Physical therapy 3 miles away.  00:33:08 Speaker 3  It gave three options, the title how far away it was. Yeah. Is that OK?  00:33:17 Speaker 2  Yes.  00:33:19 Speaker 1  Yeah, OK, that's great. And it it is definitely listing all of that along with showing it on the screen. If there is a screen, so.  That's a good part.  Let's try.  Let's try maybe with the glasses, M, because I know that Gemini will not allow you to go live with this because it's probably location specific again.  So let's ask. The same question to Mera find me.  A physical therapist.  00:33:52 Speaker 2  Middle. The medic.  Find me a physical therapist.  To make sure the we're setting to make sure the.  00:34:14 Speaker 3  Location.  00:34:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, location is on for meta.  00:34:17 Speaker 1  Location specific. It's. Yeah. OK, so here's a good way. I think when they're if you have your glasses on and you're trying to, you know, find information that is location specific. The best option in in any situation would be because you would have your phone or your iPad, which would have the Alexa app. So you tell your glasses to open the Alexa app and you know and and then then use the command like you know, finding a doctor or, you know creating.Medication like I think what was the other one that we had difficulty with? Uh.  Ohh yeah. Finding the over the counter medications or you know, things like that, I guess that it would it, it would help a lot. I I think to just use the glasses to.  Turn turn Alexa on on an on either of those devices, the phone or iPad, whatever he has. But I think like the information related.  Questions were pretty good on Gemini and made. Up both so.  Maybe we could try 1 of this. M, let's try this. How do I treat a migraine on your meta glasses? Let's see what it says.  00:35:44 Speaker 2  In metal. How do I treat a migraine?  00:35:59 Speaker 4  Having. It set.  00:36:00 Speaker 2  Said for ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Or consult the doctor for another advice.  00:36:08 Speaker 1  OK. All right. So that's that's good information, I think and. All right. Do you want to try the same one on Gemini and compare the answers?  00:36:25 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini. How can I treat a migraine?  00:36:33 Speaker 5  Migraines can be really tough over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help. Sometimes a cold compress on your forehead or a warm bath can ease the pain too. Just a reminder that I don't provide medical advice or diagnosis. You should always talk to a medical professional.  00:36:51 Speaker 1  OK. OK. M, can you tell me? Which one had better information according to you?  00:37:00 Speaker 2  The Gemini.  00:37:01 Speaker 1  Gemini. Why do you think?  00:37:06 Speaker 2  She said because. I can't give medical advice.  00:37:11 Speaker 5  OK, great.  00:37:14 Speaker 1  OK. Alright, so it kind of gave a disclaimer that it cannot provide like any medical advice and. Well, which is good and that's why you were you would pick Gemini or Mera in this one.  00:37:34 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:37:34 Speaker 1  Yeah.  It also gave one extra information. I don't know if Maeda gave that to you, but.  Did Meda also tell about the cold compress?  00:37:48 Speaker 2  No.  00:37:48 Speaker 3  Or just.  00:37:50 Speaker 1  Yeah, it it just I think you told me only about ibuprofen and then the OR a doctor visit the doctor. So there was one extra piece of information which can be like you know, I think some people might benefit from that.  Yeah, I I mean, I have heard some people would probably use like a cold compress. So which is a good information, good piece of information.  To have, I guess.  Yeah. OK.  Alright, I think we are good, but.  I don't know.  If if you do you have anything else, M, that you would like to try on either of the tools that we have related to?  And self-care medical needs or carrying out the dog or anything, anything at all.   00:38:43 Speaker 2  No.  00:38:44 Speaker 3  I have an idea.  00:38:46 Speaker 4  Yeah.  00:38:46 Speaker 3  You're talking about laundry and self-care on the live. When I tried the live at the beach, it just took a picture, kind of like an app called seeing AI. So if I'm going to put it on live, I'll get M to ask and I'll turn the camera on him.  00:39:06 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:39:06 Speaker 3  What am I wearing? Because as a blind person, you would like to know what you're wearing, right? It does. It. Does that sound good? Let's just try to see if it'll work because it's kind of related.  00:39:12 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:39:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  00:39:19 Speaker 3  OK.  00:39:21 Speaker 2  In Germany.  00:39:23 Speaker 4  I gotta turn the camera facing.  00:39:25 Speaker 2  Gemini.  00:39:26 Speaker 4  One minute, please.  00:39:31 Speaker 3  So.  00:39:32 Speaker 2  Hey, Gemini. What am I wearing?  00:39:37 Speaker 5  I can't tell what you're wearing from here. Could you show me again?  00:39:42 Speaker 2  In Germany, what am I wearing?  00:39:52 Speaker 5  I can't see what you're wearing.  00:39:55 Speaker 3  I can't. That's what color your shirt.  00:39:58 Speaker 2  Is and Gemini? What color is my shirt?  00:40:00 Speaker 5  I can't see what you're wearing.  00:40:03  Oh.  00:40:03 Speaker 3  I and it's looking right at him. Like you can see M in the screen.  00:40:08 Speaker 1  In in the in the frame OK.  00:40:10  Yeah.  00:40:14 Speaker 5  OK, I can't tell what color your shirt.  Is.  00:40:19 Speaker 1  That's interesting.  00:40:21 Speaker 3  Ohh that is yeah, because it's not able to get the color.  00:40:26 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:40:29 Speaker 3  What color is my shirt?  00:40:29 Speaker 5  Yeah, not able to identify.  I can't tell what color your shirt is.  00:40:35 Speaker 3  I mean.  Books by Jennifer Keller.  00:40:38 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK, that's pretty interesting, I know.  00:40:45 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:40:45 Speaker 1  Because you have your front camera on and it it's it. I mean, he's in the frame, and even then it's not. Probably does it? Do you think that if you like if the front camera were to be on and you took a picture and then it would?  Be able to.  And then if you like entered it on there and then it. Would be able to talk.  00:41:13 Speaker 5  I can't use Google lens yet when we are live. For now, going live is great for things like chatting, finding answers or brainstorming new ideas.  00:41:21 Speaker 1  Got it. So.  00:41:23 Speaker 3  OK.  Are the Google ends at the top and that's what I pushed and there was nothing.  00:41:30  Nothing.  00:41:32 Speaker 3  And here. What color is my shirt?  00:41:42 Speaker 5  I'm having trouble identifying the color of your shirt. It looks like it could be pink.  00:41:46 Speaker 3  Oh, it looks like it could be pink. OK.  00:41:47 Speaker 1  Looks like OK.  00:41:50 Speaker 3  Maybe it's the lighting.  00:41:53 Speaker 1  Yeah, but you know, it should still say you know how it said for you that it could be pink.  00:42:00 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:42:00 Speaker 1  It would at least the lives 1-2 would be able to. You would think that it would be.  Able to give.  You an option at least that ohh it would. It seems like it could be this.  00:42:10 Speaker 3  Sir. Yeah, and that was using the live.  00:42:15 Speaker 1  That was using the.  00:42:16 Speaker 3  OK. And this is right this top. So maybe that's why it saw it right?  00:42:18 Speaker 1  OK.  It probably could be.  Yeah, yeah, probably this the version that you know how there's a free version of Gemini that we are using.  All of the versions are not as as advanced so.  That that could be.  It also, but yeah, I don't know.  00:42:48 Speaker 3  Yeah. Yeah. All right, that's great. Let's see.  00:42:57 Speaker 1  Right, M, I think you did a great job. Do you have anything else that you'd like to?  Share.  00:43:03 Speaker 2  No.  00:43:04 Speaker 3  No. OK, what's easier for you to use you like the Gemini?  And do you like using Alexa with your glasses?  00:43:15 Speaker 2  Yep.  00:43:16 Speaker 1  Yeah, with the glasses, I guess the I mean anything location specific or date or event specific that he has to do like calendar specific I would say I guess using the glasses to either connect it to Siri or wherever his calendar is or Alexa that would be.  That would be very good. I guess that that still works better.  00:43:40 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:43:40 Speaker 1  But I think with information Gemini.  Did a great job. I guess when it came to.  Providing short information, but still you know it's still concise, but to the point and directing it.  00:43:49 Speaker 3  Yes it will.  00:43:55 Speaker 1  Pretty well I guess.  00:43:56 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:43:58 Speaker 1  OK. I'll see you guys in the break in the main room actually, OK.  00:44:04 Speaker 3  Get ready to share something to R, M.  00:44:08 Speaker 2  Alright.     , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  It appears you have provided a detailed explanation of the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\nThe SOAP note is a structured method of documenting patient encounters that helps healthcare workers assess, diagnose, and treat patients effectively. It consists of four sections: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n1. **Subjective**: This section contains the patient's subjective experiences, personal views, or feelings about their condition. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI), which provides context for the assessment and plan.\n\n2. **Objective**: This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. **Assessment**: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, lists the problem, differential diagnoses, and discusses the plan for each problem.\n\n4. **Plan**: This section details the need for additional testing, specialist referrals, patient education, counseling, and any therapy needed (medications).\n\nThe SOAP note helps improve communication among healthcare professionals and ensures a comprehensive and efficient assessment and treatment plan for patients. However, it does have some limitations, such as the inability to document changes over time effectively. Extensions to the SOAP model, like SOAPE, have been proposed to address this gap.\n\nIn the provided conversation, the subjective information includes the patient's chief complaint (chest pain) and history of present illness (describing the chest pain). The objective information might include findings from a physical exam or laboratory tests. The assessment could involve considering potential causes for the chest pain based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, and the plan might involve ordering further tests or prescribing medication. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: MA, Speaker 3 MA\u2019s mom, Speaker 4 Gemini, Speaker 5  RT, Speaker 6    Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  There we go.  00:00:04 Speaker 2  Thank you. Alright. So M, tell me how how is it going? Have you tried using Gemini at?  All like this past week.  00:00:16 Speaker 3  Yeah, me and my mom each on Tuesday. And she asked me to use general find out what we're looking at. And I asked Gemma what we were looking at.  00:00:29 Speaker 2  Sorry, where were you at but. Did you go somewhere you said?  00:00:32 Speaker 3  Alicia Alicia beach.  00:00:35 Speaker 2  Ohh OK oh, that was that was the week before, is that correct?  00:00:39 Speaker 4  Yeah, as well as this.  00:00:41 Speaker 2  Week oh, this week too. OK, OK, so that was new.  00:00:45 Speaker 4  I'm still on summer break for a week, so we've been. Going to the beach at. Least weekly.  00:00:49 Speaker 2  That's nice. OK. OK, I got it. So then how was it different from the first time?  00:00:58 Speaker 3  Well. Ask Gemini might to somewhere we're looking at and we're on live. It looks like you guys are at the beach. And then.  You said, do you guys, are you guys having fun? I said, yeah.  00:01:15 Speaker 4  She asked if we're having fun the first week that we asked her. She did not ask that the second week did say it looks like you're at the beach.  00:01:27 Speaker 2  Got it. OK. Did it say anything about the weather or what's in the environment or nothing, just about just that you you are you are at the beach, that's all?  00:01:40 Speaker 3  Yeah, just.  00:01:40 Speaker 4  And it. Yeah. And it also like it picked up the legs. I think it picked up M's legs because he was holding the phone. And so it said it in the four ground, it shows feet or leg, something along those lines as those. And also it it took him the whole view of what it seemed. We were trying to compare it or I was trying to compare it to an app called be my eyes which is an app that the blind community uses and you can hold up your phone with be my eyes on it or you can use it through your glasses and it will. Be my eyes is where you can call a volunteer and they will describe what's going on around. A person. So I'm just trying to compare it to different things on the yeah.  00:02:38 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's interesting. OK, alright. OK. So would you say that that was a better fit when you wanted to sort of see something or ask about information about any picture or anything that's like live in front of him?  00:02:59 Speaker 4  I'd say the live is really good to be honest with you. The other thing we used it for, remember in the car when we were driving.  M's dad is from Australia. He was telling M a story about a ship that was a boat that was shipwrecked in like the 70s. And so we asked Gemini what boat was shipped wrecked in Brisbane, Australia. In the 70s and within seconds. It came back with the name and blah blah blah and my husband's going. That's exactly right. And he was some obscure thing that happened in the 70s that really didn't make worldwide news.  00:03:47 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah. So it's really digging information from. Like even the so much so many years back. So which is which is great and it's A and and the good part is that it.  Was accurate, yes.  00:04:00 Speaker 4  Yeah, it was. It was. It was for an obscure fact. It was. You know, like when was World War 2?  00:04:08 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah, OK. Well, nice. That's that's very good to know. OK, I'm gonna share my screen so we can. Get on with this. So this is going to be a little different from last year. We're just gonna do a final review where so we're just gonna review each week's learnings and then I'll provide you with an like an open-ended prompt for any like that particular topic. Of the week. And then we'll. Both of us together, M or even Mom, we can come up with two voice commands per topic and practice those using either Alexa, Gemini or even for you. Your glasses, whichever is is the best fit based on the command that you want to or the activity that you want to practice. OK, alright. So. So let's see where we we start here. So this is information seeking that was the first topic that we discussed and the topics that were covered during that week was about asking about the weather making and. Deleting to do lists, adding events to a calendar, local, asking about local and international news. And information related to sporting events or any kind of other information that you're curious about, you could ask. Those are sort of like the broad topics that we covered for information seeking that week. So let's find 2 tasks that you would like to practice. Related to information seeking and practice, those using either Gemini, your glasses, or Alexa. So let's see what you pick and then we'll decide based on that. If if that makes sense.  00:06:09 Speaker 4  What would you like to do, M?  00:06:12 Speaker 3  When is it going to rain next?  00:06:14 Speaker 4  OK, so to ask about the weather, which. Platform do you think would be better germini. OK, just let me open my phone.  00:06:33 Speaker 2  Are you asking about the weather in your area or is there somewhere you're going or you're curious about?  00:06:42 Speaker 4  Local or do you want to find out where your sister's at?  00:06:45 Speaker 3  State weather.  00:06:49 Speaker 4  OK, go with this. I'll turn the volume up high so she can hear. OK, you ready?  00:06:58 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemina.  00:06:59 Speaker 3  What is the local state weather?  00:07:05 Speaker 5  In state it's 83 and sunny today it'll be sunny with a high of 86 and.  A low of 60.  00:07:12 Speaker 3  Is it going? To rain this soon.  00:07:16 Speaker 5  Currently, there's no chance of rain.  00:07:20 Speaker 3  That makes sense.  00:07:23 Speaker 2  OK, very good.  00:07:24 Speaker 5  OK, you'd like to know if it's.  00:07:29 Speaker 2  That's perfect. OK. All right, what did you? Is that very where your sister lives or what did you say?  00:07:37 Speaker 4  Did so I asked if M wanted to ask where his sisters cause his sister is in Africa, right? Now. Ohh. I at. If you want to ask what the.  Weather where she's at.  00:07:48 Speaker 2  OK, OK, got it. Got it. OK, that was really good. M, I think you did a great job and I think it picked up your command really easily and it it seems like it provided the appropriate weather conditions and everything and also chances of rain. So that's that's great.  Good job asking a follow-up question, M, that was very good. Yeah, alright, let's find another task that or another task or activity related to information seeking that you would like to ask.  00:08:23 Speaker 4  You know what you want to ask?  00:08:25 Speaker 3  Gemini, what's your favorite color?  00:08:26 Speaker 4  No, no, no. Let's not do favorite color. Let's think information setting or something in the world, something global, something.  00:08:36 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemini. What's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:39 Speaker 4  No, it's tap the phone.  00:08:45 Speaker 3  Hey, Gemma, what's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:49 Speaker 5  Africa is a big place, so the weather varies a lot. It could be hot and dry in the Sahara or warm and humid in the.  Congo do. Have a specific country or city in mind.  00:08:58 Speaker 3  Tanzania.  00:09:02 Speaker 5  OK, in Tanzania it's currently 71\u00b0 and partly cloudy. It's going to be mostly sunny with a high of 82 and a low of 69\u00b0.  00:09:12 Speaker 3  About Kenya.  00:09:17 Speaker 5  OK, in Nairobi, Kenya, it's currently 55\u00b0 and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 77\u00b0 and the low is 54\u00b0.  00:09:27 Speaker 3  In Uganda.  00:09:32 Speaker 5  OK. In Kampala, Uganda it's currently 64\u00b0 and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 81\u00b0 and the low is 63\u00b0.  00:09:43 Speaker 2  That's great.  00:09:44 Speaker 3  581 in the low 64.  00:09:45 Speaker 4  Yeah, those are the three places his sister is. Going to be.  00:09:50 Speaker 2  OK. That makes sense. OK, way. To go like with asking all those. Follow-ups, M again, great job.  00:09:57 Speaker 3  Thank you.  00:09:58 Speaker 2  OK. So that I think the live is working much better when whenever he's using Gemini. I guess when in the first session when we are trying to do the weather related questions it was. It was not taking the place. Remember the location and then we had to sort of say the location I think doing live makes like I think it it catches the location on its own or something.  00:10:27 Speaker 4  I agree, and I think live for M especially is a lot easier because when you're not on live, you have to touch the button at the bottom, the microphone and then if you want to stop, you have to find the stop button at the top of the phone. And when you use voiceover, you can do that, but you have to go through it will read every single section.  00:10:54 Speaker 2  Yeah, right.  00:10:57 Speaker 4  Live you just touch the screen anywhere and away you go. Touch the screen again. And it stops.  00:11:03 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's that is really good, I think, yeah, I I I'm glad we found that and found it really quick early on in the training.  00:11:11 Speaker 2  So that has helped a lot. I feel alright, so move on.  00:11:16 Speaker 4  And M can also ask S you know who else is to open up that app and then go to live and it it will just do.  00:11:26 Speaker 2  It OK. Alright, so that's even better because if no one's around you, he could always do that, right, M? Like you can ask. Your phone phones assistant starting with us and and just say that open or like start live on on Gemini or something.  00:11:45 Speaker 3  Yeah. OK.  00:11:48 Speaker 2  OK. So M, the next topic we or we talked about was entertainment. This was I think on one of the Tuesdays that you were not not here and you were at your therapy session. So from last year you might remember that we talked about the different topics under entertainment. It was related to searching information related to media, listening to music, watching movie. These with Gemini and AI tools you can also generate stories and generate any content like generate new content and new stories and you can also tell jokes and play trivia games like you were able to on Alexa. So if you. Were to do. Two tasks related to entertainment. What would you pick?  00:12:41 Speaker 3  Or task. Who made V for Vendetta the movie? 00:12:45 Speaker 2  OK. All right, so UM and what would you, which platform would you use? Which tool you would use for that? It could be your glasses or Gemini or even Alexa or your phones assistant.  00:13:06 Speaker 3  Wanna ask Gemini?  00:13:07  Speaker 2 OK. All right, let's try.  00:13:10 Speaker 4  Go ahead.  00:13:11 Speaker 3  Hey Gemini, who made the V for Vendetta movie?  00:13:17 Speaker 5  V for Vendetta was directed by James Mcteigue of the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis, who were famous for the Matrix movies.  00:13:27 Speaker 2  Is that correct, M?  00:13:28 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:13:29 Speaker 2 OK. Alright,  00:13:31 Speaker 4  M, what do you use on a multiple times during the day with your glasses? What do you ask your glasses? No, you don't. What do you do multiple times and I have to ask you to please stop. No play. No. Player. And play his music multiple times, OK, He uses his glasses a lot to play his music because it will play music from.  00:14:05 Speaker 3  Apple music.  00:14:06 Speaker 4  Apple music or from Amazon? It'll he has to.  00:14:10 Speaker 2  Tell it. OK. Alright. Do you want to try using one of those commands and see? So when you when you use that command does it that will directly come via your earphones of the of your glasses, correct?  00:14:24 Speaker 3  Yeah, yeah.  00:14:25 Speaker 2  OK, alright. We can try that, that works. OK. Whenever you're ready and whatever music you want to play.  00:14:37 Speaker 4  What do you want to listen to?  00:14:39 Speaker 3  It's on my phone.  00:14:40 Speaker 4  OK. Can you say the command? Is it playing the music automatically? It's playing the music automatically.  00:14:50 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:14:54 Speaker 2  OK, so without even.  00:14:56 Speaker 4  Playing sometimes M will say he'll think of a song that he would like to hear, so he'll say, play whatever by whoever, and the glasses, we'll just play it. Or sometimes we could be in a store. And you know how they play music in the stores? He can say, hey, may that what song is playing? And it'll Maida will come back and tell him the name and author of whatever song is playing in the store.  00:15:26 Speaker 2  OK, got it. So right now I think it just heard us talking about playing music and even M confirming that he wanted to play music and then it just started playing music. Yes, OK.  00:15:40 Speaker 4  Yes  00:15:40 Speaker 2  Got it. OK.  00:15:40 Speaker 4  Your music off.  00:15:43 Speaker 2  Alright, M can. You try changing a song or giving it another command which which might help us kind of see how it how. It works  00:15:52 Speaker 4  for something specific.  00:15:54 Speaker 3  10 minutes. Played double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:05 Speaker 2  Is that working?  00:16:07 Speaker 3  Yeah 00:16:08 Speaker 4  It just said here's double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:11 Speaker 2  And So what is the default when it comes to playing music? So right now, like M, you did not specify that you're wanting to play on Amazon Music or, you know, something else or Apple music or anything. So how does it just take?  00:16:32 Speaker 2  Any of those uhm, platforms? Or does it ask you?  00:16:37 Speaker 3  Dad, who's double up by Nipsey Hussle from Apple Music.  00:16:42 Speaker 4  So that must be the default. It goes straight to is that Apple music?  00:16:46 Speaker 2  Apple Music, OK make sense 00:16:48 Speaker 4  We do have that in. A play list on your phone and it was already on his phone too.  00:16:53 Speaker 2  Got it, OK, alright, makes sense. M, that's pretty good. Anything else you'd like to? Do you using Gemini especially because I know you were not here during this particular topic training, so I wanted to see. Like if you wanted to generate a story or I. I don't know if you've ever used to generate content like that and if you were interested in doing that with Gemini. So you wanted to like, you know, listen to a story specifically on, you know, your favorite. Animals or like you know, something like like, you know anything it could be or it could be like a day at the beach or, you know, something some of your favorite action movies or something. And you could try using that and see. If you give it a few details, and if it would come up with a story for you.  00:17:57 Speaker 3  OK.  00:17:59 Speaker 2  So you want to tell us what you want to listen to 1st and then maybe once you know that life starts and you can say it.  00:18:07 Speaker 3  Match. Him or her to give me a short story about V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:13 Speaker 2  OK. Yeah.  00:18:18 Speaker 3  Can you create a short story? Short story for me from the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:27 Speaker 5  In a dystopian London, a masked vigilante named V fights against a totalitarian regime. He rescues a young woman named Evie and introduces her to his world of revolution as they work together, Evie learns about these past and his plans to ignite a rebellion against the oppressive government. In the end, these actions inspired the.  00:18:48 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:18:49 Speaker 4  Is that good? Is that?  00:18:50 Speaker 3  Yep.  00:18:51 Speaker 4  What the movie was about.  00:18:52 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:18:53 Speaker 2  Is that is that the only information that came up or was it like very long?  00:18:58 Speaker 4  I have to go back. Just give me a SEC.  00:19:01 Speaker 2  Oh, OK, OK. I was just curious.  00:19:11 Speaker 4  No, it was quite short. If you can see that.  00:19:16 Speaker 2  Yeah. Ohh OK, that's pretty short. Yeah, so. It's like a few sentences, like maybe like 3 to 4 sentences which.  00:19:25 Speaker 4  Yeah, I'd say 3 UM, maybe about 5.  00:19:28 Speaker 2  Five sentences. OK, alright, that's not too bad. It's definitely like much better than like, you know, asking for news that time and it like giving a bunch of information instead of like just, you know, trying to give you the gist of it. And this seems like almost. A gist or the summary of of the of the entire movie or the, you know, just the plot of the movie. Which which makes sense, but that's great. So M, you can always use these AI tools even here. I think your glasses might be a good option when you have a question like that. Or maybe you wanted synopsis. Of a book. Or you know that you'd like to read or a movie or anything. A. A series that you were kind of interested to learn about and it would give you the details about it, you know, so that you could, you could probably decide based on that whether you want to see something or listen to something or and or not, you know.  00:20:27 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:20:27 Speaker 2  Yeah, that would. Be nice. All right, so moving on the the third week or the third session was self-care and medical needs. So we here we discussed topics related to medication management, creating medication lists and finding medications. Searching for self-care tips such as laundry or caring for a loved ones or loved ones or pets, and we asked a bunch of questions about about your pet. The last time. And tips to improve mental and physical health and searching for home remedies if you if you needed something. So now based on these topics, let's find 2 activities again related to self-care and medical needs and then we can practice those. And we'll, we'll base it on which tool or platform to use based on what you want to practice.  00:21:27 Speaker 4  Gemini. OK. And what are you going to ask?  00:21:30 Speaker 3  Right from my head.  00:21:31 Speaker 4  Ohh. Could you say it louder so they can hear you?  00:21:32 Speaker 3  What's that? How do I comb my hair?  00:21:40 Speaker 4  Yeah.  00:21:41 Speaker 3  How do I comb my hair?  00:21:46 Speaker 5  Well, there are a few ways to approach it. You could start by figuring out what kind of style you're going for. Do you want something classic trendy. Or maybe a bit edgy.  00:21:55 Speaker 3  Trendy.  00:21:59 Speaker 5  OK, for something trendy you could try a textured crop with a matte finish. Or if you have longer hair, a messy Cliff might work. Do either of those sound like something? You'd like to try.  00:22:08 Speaker 3  What's a messy quote?  00:22:12 Speaker 5  A messy quiff is a hairstyle that's shorter on the sides and back, but with longer hair on top that's styled upwards and slightly messy, it's a pretty popular. Look right now.  00:22:25 Speaker 5  You're welcome. Do you need help finding a? Good Barber or salon?  00:22:28 Speaker 3  No thanks.  00:22:32 Speaker 2  Yeah, that's great. OK, I wonder that was that was really good back and forth conversation, I think and things that are that are that are that are most amazing I feel and those are the differences between using like like. Versus, you know, Gemini is you know, even if there's hesitations or interruptions, when a command is being presented to to that tool, it still picks up. It doesn't. It's not very quick to say, oh, I did not understand. So the the speech recognition is so much better. You think like that and?It it leads to less frustration.  00:23:17 Speaker 4  And it's more social, yeah.  00:23:19 Speaker 2  Yes, for sure. Definitely more social because it it's asking good follow up questions too, like for example right now with the Barber and you know finding something and just the back and forth it, it feels more human too and less robotic so.  00:23:37 Speaker 4  I. Have. I've noticed that the a device. Is the has slowly getting a little bit more personable as well as, for example, tonight M asked her to set a timer and before she did she said good evening M. I'll set a timer for 10 minutes or whatever. There it was.  00:24:01 Speaker 2  That's good. OK. Yeah. So it's it's definitely it's getting into those greetings and a little bit of personalization based on who's talking to it instead of like just you know generally answering like it would. So yeah, that makes sense. OK, Alright, M, what would be the next? A second task for you related to self-care and medical needs.   00:24:28 Speaker 3  Say, hey, Gemini, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:35 Speaker 4  You want that one, it wants a.  00:24:35 Speaker 3 Yeah. Hey, Gemma, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:45 Speaker 5  OK, here's how to put gel in your hair. Start with a small amount about a pea size drop and rub it between your palms. Apply it evenly, working from the roots to the ends. Style is desired and add more gel if needed.  00:24:57 Speaker 3  Thanks. I'll do that, Gemini. 00:25:03 Speaker 2  That's good. OK.  00:25:04 Speaker 5  OK, work tips on styling it.  00:25:06 Speaker 3  Thank you. I will.  00:25:10 Speaker 2 OK, alright, perfect. OK, so the next one next topic was meal preparation and cooking. Again that one was when on one of the on past Tuesday actually when you were not around. So we can probably practice some of the commands from maybe last year you remember how we talked about making shopping lists. By adding or viewing or listing the items that were on the list on the shopping list and then removing items, we could find recipes or find recipes related to some certain dietary restrictions. Whether it could be gluten free or vegan, or another one of the dietary restrictions that some people might. Have finding nutritional facts about different foods, for example, number of grams of sugar or sodium in a particular food item. Finding calories in some some kind of food. Finding the ingredients for cooking a specific food and then following the recipe. Like instruction by instruction or step by step.So based on all of those ideas, let's find 2 activities related to meal preparation. Before you do, I wanted to ask you, is there particularly anything that has changed from the past year that you've been contributing more towards when it comes to meal preparation, is there, are there things that have changed while you were in the kitchen with your parents or you know, while you were helping them prep?  00:26:53 Speaker 3  Yeah. Well, I came home from the army and they weren't. Me. So that's a big change.  00:27:02 Speaker 4  M, what about when going to Costco? What have you been doing more of? Putting the list on what?  00:27:12 Speaker 3  Hey.  00:27:12 Speaker 4  Yes, he's been making that list for us on and then when we're at, for example, Costco. Because it comes with glasses, he will just say I'll say them. Here's, you know, the strawberries, the bananas, and he'll tell her. Check off strawberries. Check off bananas. That kind of thing.  00:27:33 Speaker 2  OK, so mainly managing making and managing lists for for shopping is something that you do. And I think A is a perfect solution when it comes to something like that or even even the phones assistant S would do a better job, I guess because it would directly put on the notes section and make a list there. So that makes sense. So let do you think you want to try? Making a list or like is there something that you want to add to your shopping list that we could we could practice now? Or is there something else that you would like to do?  00:28:13 Speaker 4  To grab the. M, is it? Do you want to make a? List. Or do you want to get something different?  00:28:17 Speaker 3  Yeah, I would like to make. A list. Should I go to Alexa?  00:28:23 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, you can. I think your mom's just getting Alexa.  00:28:30 Speaker 3  Sure.  00:28:32 Speaker 2  Uh. Your iPad. OK, yeah.  00:28:34 Speaker 4  M's phone is having some major technical difficulties. Ohh on the side has broken off so. We're waiting kind of for his sister to get back so I can change the plan and the phones and everything. One of those things.  00:28:54 Speaker 2  Too many things when there's too so many technologies together at you so.  00:28:59 Speaker 4  You gotta get older. You'll understand my pain.  00:29:03 Speaker 2  No, I don't. I know.  00:29:06 Speaker 4  OK, M, it's ready.  00:29:09 Speaker 3  Yeah, Alexa.Add marshmallows to my Costco list.  00:29:17 Alexa  Marshmallows added to Costco.  00:29:20 Speaker 2  OK. So are you are you, are you managing like multiple lists? Because you said Costco lists. So are there like different lists for different places? That you usually manage.  00:29:34 Speaker 3  Yeah.  00:29:36 Speaker 4  What's the other one? Not albertson's.  00:29:39 Speaker 3  Albertsons.  00:29:41 Speaker 2  OK. Makes sense?  00:29:46 Speaker 3  Hey, Alexa. Add cookies to my Albertson's list.  00:29:52 Alexa Cookies added to Albertsons.  00:29:54 Speaker 2  OK. Perfect. That's. That's really good. Anything else that you do with respect to meal preparation when you are in the kitchen with your dad or your mom when while they're cooking or before they're start, they start to cook?  00:30:12 Speaker 3  Hey, Alexa. Add pasta to the Albertson's list.  00:30:19 Alexa  The cost?  00:30:22 Speaker 4  What else do you do though, to help you? M sometimes helps with like cutting or that type of thing.  00:30:28 Speaker 2  Oh, OK. Do you have any questions when you when you have to do anything of that sort related to it?  00:30:37 Speaker 3  No, this guy Cesar, who's my OT specialist, got me some gloves. That are pretty nice.  00:30:44 Speaker 2  OK. All right.  00:30:47 Speaker 4  But M sets a lot of timers as well. For meeting you, set a timer for. The pizza, right?  00:30:57 Speaker 2  Right. Like how much like that would tell you how much, how much time you should boil something for or like just steam something for and just put a timer and then OK. Got it, alright, but but that's pretty good like I think. Managing lists was. Yes. Was definitely great. Do you? Do you have anything else that you would would like to find out? Like finding caloric calories in foods or nutritional facts about any food that you'd like to ask? And maybe we could this time try to use Gemini and see see if that works and how that would work because we've not gotten to practice. This part.  00:31:37 Speaker 3  OK.  00:31:38 Speaker 2  OK. What? What question are you going to ask?  00:31:44 Speaker 3  How much sugar is in the cookies I eat?  00:31:47 Speaker 4  What kind of cookies are you talking about? OK, makes you.  00:31:49 Speaker 3  Symptoms.  00:31:54 Speaker 4  On the tape, OK.  00:31:58 Speaker 3  How much sugar is in the Tim Toms?  00:32:04 Speaker 5  I couldn't find how much sugar is in Tim Tams. You might be able to find that information on the nutrition label on the packaging or on the manufacturer's website.  00:32:12 Speaker 3  OK. Thank you. Hey, Gemini. How much sugar is in the Milo? 00:32:21 Speaker 5  OK, according to the official Milo website, a cup of Milo has about 1 teaspoon of added sugar that's on top of the natural sugars from the milk and malt barley. Does that answer your question?  00:32:31 Speaker 3  Yeah, it does. Thank you.  00:32:33 Speaker 2  OK. So that's good. I mean if it doesn't have an answer to any question, then it will just say that you know it, I don't know about that.  00:32:43 Speaker 4  Yeah. And where to find it?  00:32:45 Speaker 2  Yeah. And where to find it? Yeah, that's that's really good. Alright, so that's the end of our review. Let me stop sharing for a minute and then we'll move on to some of the questions. That we have here.  00:33:05 Speaker 2  OK. Alright, so I'm just going to ask. This was also. The last time that we did the training that we just asked questions about how do you find the training? What kind of problems or challenges you faced and justice sharing about the AI in general and the training satisfaction etc. OK so start M with you and Lauren you can chime in anytime you anytime you think you wanted to contribute so. Because these some of these questions I'm starting with are related to AI satisfaction. So was it difficult or easy for you to use your AI? So Gemini or your glasses for that matter, we're gonna take both into consideration since we've used both through the training and you use those, I think you use your glasses a lot during your day-to-day life so. Tell me about it. How easy or difficult you think?  00:34:07 Speaker 3  We're using at my glass store someone just like Dang. Thank you, Gemini.  00:34:09 Speaker 2  OK. OK. So same with Gemini and and your glasses. It's easy for you to use them, OK?  00:34:20 Speaker 4  The glasses and Gemini pick up where? The a device leaves off base. They all have their place. The truly they truly have their own place, but I can see. There are certain activities 1 is better than the other, but if you can't get the answer on one, you can go to another and that's nice. Having that option, yeah, yeah.  00:34:39 Speaker 2  OK. OK, what specific problems have you faced with Gemini? For example, does it have difficulties understanding your speech or does it have have any difficulties understanding your language or or any sort of navigation issues that you've had? The Gemini.  00:35:08 Speaker 3  There's not really any.  00:35:12 Speaker 4  Actually no. And when we're in the car on Tuesday, we asked a question and it could not understand what we were asking. So we had to rework it. I'm trying to think of what that.Question was.  00:35:28 Speaker 3  Me too.  00:35:31 Speaker 4  It had to do with that boat in Australia we had to. I think it was the way the question was worded the first time. It was unable, it gave information, but it was not accurate. It was about something that happened somewhere else in Australia. But when we added.  00:35:49 Speaker 3  Been on the beach.  00:35:51 Speaker 4  Yes, that's right. When we added Brisbane to it, we're a little bit more specific. It gave a more specific answer.  00:35:59 Speaker 2  OK, makes sense. All right, so that, but when it comes to so you have to sometimes tweak your language and the words to make sure that it gives the information that you're looking for.That makes sense. OK, alright.  How about speech? I think, is there any difficulty? Do you do you feel with with respect to your understanding of speech or? For navigation with Gemini, I think ever since you found the live option, but he could go live on Gemini, I think it's it's really good. I guess the navigation has become much easier.  00:36:42 Speaker 4  Yes, it has. But remember, last week when we were on live, I'll say the question and they couldn't answer that question. Remember, I can't remember what it was for. I can't remember what it was, but we were we asked a question on live and it said you have to go. We don't have the capability yet to.  00:37:01 Speaker 2  Oh oh, I think it was like asking us to link it to Google Workspace or something, and it was about the events.  00:37:10 Speaker 4  Something along the side, yeah.  00:37:12 Speaker 2  Yeah, trying to set up events and and. The same happened. What\u2019s that? 00:37:18 Speaker 4  On the calendar, that's right.  00:37:19 Speaker 2  Calendar. Yes, yes, it it. It kind of told that it would not be able to. Yes that that those kind of questions I guess are tests where it's linked to a certain calendar. If it does not have access to it, it's gonna have a hard time linking it or you know that that's going to be. Only there. So when it comes to reminders or scheduling appointments or any of that I guess. The others are much better. Instead of like using AI and and I think you're already doing that and it's it's that's perfect. You know, whatever is working is working and what we don't want to fix, what's not broken you know so it's that's that's good. All right. So that's good. What do you like most about having Gemini, M?  00:38:10 Speaker 3  He understands me. Well.  00:38:13 Speaker 2  Yeah. So the speech recognition part is very good. It's it's a much, I think it's it's much better when it when compared to last last year's training with Alexa, I guess because you know if there were words or names of movies and people or topics or you know or. Something like a proper noun. And I think it was not correctly pronounced. It would not take that like and it would. You know, we had so much reworking always with the commands that we used to do. So that definitely is is really good. And then what do you dislike the most about having Gemini?  00:38:55 Speaker 4  The good thing too is Gemini allows a bit of a pause, a lot of times. Your follow-up question has to be really quick as Gemini allows a little bit more of a pause, allows a little bit more time for that follow up question actually and it allows a little bit more time than M's glasses. Lows.  00:39:16 Speaker 2  Ohh OK, so that's even a difference between those two AI tools. I mean, and in that case, that's great. OK. Yeah, there's definitely. And sometimes if you if if you talk too quickly after you know the after saying the wake word, it still takes that information. And if sometimes you don't say Gemini and you start just talking when you're alive. It still takes up that information. You don't have to every time say that which which I think is, is this really good when it comes to UM? You know, just normal normalizing like a conversation between two humans, like you don't always say the person's name or something, right? So that that. Makes sense. 00:40:04 Speaker 4   A little bit of a sound because M didn't have to ask. Use, say Gemini tonight at all because it makes a little sound. I don't know if you heard the sound, but it's almost like. Like when you turn on the device. You can hear the sound OK. Like a woosh, so to speak, and so he could hear that and then just go from there.  00:40:25 Speaker 2  Right. So you would know that it's it's on and like you can you can talk now and makes sense. Is there anything that you dislike about Gemini about having Gemini?  Speaker 3 No 00:40:38 Speaker 2  No. OK.  00:40:39 Speaker 4  That's the difference between Gemini and a because a just gives you a blue light and it. Cannot see the blue light. You don't know if it's on. Or not, yes. That's the big difference between them. 00:40:53 Speaker 2  That's a big difference. That's right. What would you change to Gemini to? Make it easier to use. Is there anything?  00:41:03 Speaker 3  Voice recognition.  00:41:07 Speaker 4  Well, but it is recognizing your voice.  00:41:10 Speaker 3  Speech recognition.  00:41:14 Speaker 2  Yeah, I I think that's that's why I think speech and word recognition is pretty good when when you're comparing Gemini to a I guess because it it's definitely doing better. But is there anything that you would change to make it? In any. Other aspect like how? It could be anything else too, and you know it doesn't have to be something.  00:41:39 Speaker 4  And I better.  Speaker 3 Speech resolution 00:41:42 Speaker 4  We're not sure if Gemini goes through M's glasses or not, and so if it doesn't, that would be a definite plus because remember, made us doing their own AI. So I don't know that it would go through the glasses.  00:42:00 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah. Because you know the the glasses allow him to add things to the to a. And like, you know, for the shopping list and things like that. So those two can be synched but. Yeah, I'm not sure that might be something to look into if if those if it would allow Gemini or you know some other like ChatGPT or something. But I believe it would not yeah, because you know how Alexa does not allow S or.  00:42:14 Speaker 4  And. I agree.  00:42:34 Speaker 2  This does not allow a like something because those are the parallels like they are competitors almost. So I guess that would be classes allow Surrey.  00:42:42 Speaker 4  Class. Yes, because the glasses no. You need the phone to work because the glass is paired to the phone. So I think that.  00:42:52 Speaker 2  Yeah. And I think the glasses might be also OK with like a regular Google Assistant, but not like an AI powered. You know what I mean? Because it has its own AI, but that's interesting. Maybe it's it's worth checking. Like, I I don't know whether you know it. It it could just surprise us by having. You know, be having the ability to say.  00:43:15 Speaker 4  The glasses are paired with the be my eyes app that is their accessibility feature for the blind, and so that is one thing that they truly are paired with.  00:43:22 Speaker 2  OK. Right, right. OK, that's that's good to know. OK. All right. So in this training we covered. 4 topics. So we did. News and facts, which is information. Entertainment self-care, medical needs and meal preparation. What topic would you continue to use after this training with, with with Gemini especially and why?  00:43:57 Speaker 3  Meal preparation.  00:44:00 Speaker 2  OK. Is there is there a reason why?  00:44:03 Speaker 3  Because. I think my parents would be. Happy I didn't have no preparation.   Speaker 2 Yeah, that for sure, but.  00:44:15 Speaker 4  Personally, forget about us.  00:44:16 Speaker 3  Entertainment.  00:44:20 Speaker 2  Entertainment.  00:44:21 Speaker 3  Entertainment.  00:44:23 Speaker 2  OK. What, what? What specifically in entertainment would you? Use it for.  00:44:31 Speaker 3  And my favorite songs.  00:44:34 Speaker 2  OK. Anything new? Because you're already doing those things right? Like you are playing songs already. Using your glasses. Is there anything new you would do with with with using Gemini and especially related to entertainment?  00:44:53 Speaker 4  Think about learning. Maybe about more about. The different songs or the different actors or? Different movies. Yeah.  00:45:06 Speaker 2  Well, it just.  00:45:08 Speaker 4  He just said, like, what happened to Hulk Hogan? Because, you know, it's all over the news. Right now, yeah.  00:45:13 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. Yeah. So that that makes sense. So like you would you would want to get more information about those you know those those particular movies or series related to entertainment? And maybe generate like synopsis or you know a little summary of the movie or a book or, you know, yeah, that would, that would be great. Alright. So what are your goal? What were your goals before we started this training and have you met them?  00:45:49 Speaker 4  What's your goal? What was one of your goals? Was it to learn more about Gemini or?  00:45:52 Speaker 3  Yes.  00:45:55 Speaker 4  Have you? Do you feel you've met that goal or?  00:45:56 Speaker 3  Yeah, I think here.  00:46:00 Speaker 4  You think you have.  Speaker 2 OK. Yeah 00:46:02 Speaker 4  We were at the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum. On the weekend, M used his glasses a lot there, you know, what am I looking at? You know, you're looking at an Oscar statue by whatever or, you know, the costume that Ryan seek. Was it was it?  00:46:22 Speaker 3  Brian. OK.  00:46:24 Speaker 4  Ryan, whatever the guy that wore the pink suit with the diamonds for Barbie. Yeah, yeah. Bribed that. So he used the glasses a lot for that. To what am I looking at? And he would just getting information about the different things. At the museum.  00:46:40 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. So that's I I think the glasses are such a good. Tool to have, especially when you are traveling and going places just to get more information and and it's portable enough and you don't have to take your phone out each time to sort of you know get, get, get whatever information you need. So that's perfect so. You've definitely gotten better using AI tools within your class. Glasses and anything else?  00:47:15 Speaker 4  That like in the car on the way back from that museum, we, him and I to ask a question about it, was something related to the museum. I honestly can't remember what it was. A friend of Ms was also in the car. With us and had asked a question about one of the shows or things that we saw there. Is it like when was the movie like Casablanca or something like that? I can't remember. What year? So we asked Gemini, remember distinctly. I don't remember what movie present.  00:47:48 Speaker 2  Yeah. No, no, but that's great. OK. And did you pick? Was that your first choice like that? You wanted to ask Gemini and. OK, alright.  00:47:59 Speaker 4  Gemini rather than Google it, we just asked. Gemini, Gemini.  00:48:02 Speaker 2  Yeah. OK. Alright. So M, do you have any suggestions for this training program?  00:48:09 Speaker 3  That's Gemini. What your favorite colors.  00:48:13 Speaker 4  M,  Speaker 3 so great guys.  00:48:17 Speaker 4  Forget the color.  00:48:21 Speaker 2  Anything specific that you have like any suggestions you may have for us, uh or in the for the for the training program or how it should be or anything differently that we should do?  00:48:33 Speaker 3  When is Google gonna let you go? When it's going to let you leave.  00:48:41 Speaker 4  What?  00:48:42 Speaker 3  Good job.  00:48:43 Speaker 4  Ohh I say it, the format that you're doing is very good and that doing the breakout rooms is good. The questions, the slides that you have because. If M could see, he would be able to refer back to the slides. I know I was looking at the slides and you would ask a question. So I think it's a very. Good format. 00:49:06 Speaker 2   OK great. OK.  00:49:08 Speaker 4  Kind of the way that you read it out loud for M, it enables him to participate, so. I think. Yeah, you've made it. You've done the training in a way that maintains. M's interest.  00:49:22 Speaker 2  Ohh for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's really nice to know. Alright so. So do you have any questions or feedback about Geminis responses? UM, anything with the responses that went well and any challenges that you encounter with the responses? But ever since we we started like related to Gemini. Yeah. Any responses that you particularly like and those went wrong versus some things that didn't go well.  00:49:58 Speaker 3  Not that I could think of.  00:50:01 Speaker 4  I think the responses that were more personable kept M's interest and then he would. Ask a follow up question. 00:50:09 Speaker 2  Yeah. Yeah, 00:50:10 Speaker 4  You could just almost see a conversation going back and. Forth, 00:50:13 Speaker 2  back and forth.  00:50:16 Speaker 4  And if it wasn't as personable or gemini, and I wasn't quite understanding what the question was.  00:50:23 Speaker 3  She basically say what?  00:50:24 Speaker 4  It kind of cut, cut the conversation quickly.  00:50:29 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, that was the good part. Definitely. Like how? Especially with the sugar content that you just asked, like, you know, I did not know the answer and it still gave you a good follow up like you know response that ohh you could check here like you know and instead of like just giving a wig and incorrect answer. So that makes sense. What are some of the challenges that you encountered when asking for responses?  00:51:00 Speaker 3  Speech recognition.  00:51:03 Speaker 4  I would guess not responding quick enough. Like not asked.If you weren't quite sure what you were asking. And you start talking and you're not, and you're trying to come up with the correct answer. Yeah, she loses you.  00:51:21 Speaker 2  OK, OK.  00:51:22 Speaker 4  A little bit quicker.  00:51:24 Speaker 2  Be a little bit quicker in terms of responses, OK. Anything else that you can think of when it comes to challenges?  00:51:37 Speaker 3  He understands very much time, but not all the time.  00:51:40 Speaker 2  OK. All right. Can you give me an example of when? She doesn't understand.  00:51:48 Speaker 3  When she doesn\u2019t? 00:51:49 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:51:52 Speaker 4  Did you when you mumble a little bit?  00:51:53 Speaker 3  Now remember, a little bit should be like what did you say?  00:51:56 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:51:58 Speaker 3  I'll clear my my throat and say I said this, that or the third.  00:52:04 Speaker 2  OK. All right. That makes sense. OK. Another this is my personal thing, but I think when we first started. And we did the. Participatory design, especially when we were talking about all the responses, M and you know how you asked about the conflict between Israel and Iran. And it just sort of gave you like so much information at once and that was the thing with all the different AI tools that we tried that day. It was so much more descriptive. So.  00:52:46 Speaker 1  Hi. Claire, are we done with M?  00:52:53 Speaker 6  No, we're still on 3.1.  00:52:55 Speaker 1  Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.  00:52:56 Speaker 6  Yeah. No, you're good. Are you? Yeah.  00:52:59 Speaker 1  Hey, we just want to say bye to M and then we'll probably let her go. Yeah, because we finished early. Sorry about that. OK. Let's see. R, I may just ask you to share with Claire and Peter like one quick comment and then maybe we don't get enough time to show M. If you want to show, show them stuff you work on today as a final. Ohh there. There's. Hi. Sorry for interrupting. I know you 2 are still going. R. Want to say hi before our summer program ends, so I just figured R will show something, and then we'll let you go back to the room again. Yes, interrupting.  00:53:49 Speaker 6  Oh yeah, I was just gonna. I was using Geminni for. They to health they personal health.Like. Like things to do to, like, calm yourself down. So it's like. Like calming yourself, doing music and going outside. And just like she would give me a list of things to do and just doing creative and doing self-care. And I is music soothing does like using Geminis give you these little prompts so you can find. Find they calm or just being. You could see their mind through things like journaling and aromatherapy and just. It's even just petting them or just listening to music and writing it down, so it's like. Do you ever name is the platform I can get all these. It's just like a short list of things you just care for yourself, like doing exercise or like if she wants you. Ohh you can do some aromatherapy and just she just gives you a list of things you can back yourself up with a self-care.  00:55:00 Speaker 4  R is sharing the list of things that Gemini I told her, and she shared her screen showing the different suggestions that Gemini gave her.  00:55:10 Speaker 3  OK. That's nice. Yeah. Share your screen, R.  00:55:15 Speaker 1  And do you want to read maybe one or think one or two things that you may do this summer so M can know your summer rest of your summer plan?  00:55:26 Speaker 6  Ohh like you know. Like like end of next weekend, like coming next couple weeks. You U.S. Open of surfing is in Huntington and we're using temerity to like find parking and they're looking for survey competitions cause we asked asked her about like when will. Like the longboard surf surfing contests happen cause I like surfing longboard cause. I was like, want to watch that cause I'm not that really that great. But I just like watching. So just using Gemini to like give me information about things I like to watch. Just just to for my own summer plans. Yeah.  00:56:11 Speaker 3  Thank you for the information, R.  00:56:14 Speaker 1  M, do you have anything you want to tell R before we let her Go.  00:56:18 Speaker 4  Tell her, UM, what? We asked. Gemini will move in the car. Coming back from the beach.  00:56:24 Speaker 3  Yes, we ask Gemini, we ask Gemini, where we were.  00:56:29 Speaker 4  About the boat in Australia.  00:56:30 Speaker 3  About the boat in Australia. Is it boat that crashed? It crashed on Rainbow Beach and my boss told us about Rainbow Beach because he was from Australia. And the ship crashed in the 80s and the 70s.  00:56:47 Speaker 6  Oh.  00:56:47 Speaker 4  And so Gemini gave an obscure fact that we fall from the 70s when his father lived in Australia.  00:56:56 Speaker 6  It's like, yeah, like a family connection, but it's like. Pam is sometimes history is. Feel you feel like. Some kind of connection, yeah.  00:57:09 Speaker 4  His dad had told him a story and M verified the story with Gemini.  00:57:14 Speaker 6  Using it, it's kinda it's like this really happened. Like OK is it? Gemini knows. Yeah, it was there. So it's like backing information to what your dad told you. She it was a real thing. So you should have my. It's like another. Like another perspective for us, like using our life, yeah.  00:57:36 Speaker 4  Yeah, that's right.  00:57:38 Speaker 1  Thank you so much for sharing M and prayer let you folks go back into. Your room, OK. Yeah. And Kelly and Larry and Arisha and R, you are free to go. Having summer will stay in. Touch.  00:57:50 Speaker 2  Alright, OK.  00:57:52 Speaker 6  OK. Bye bye.  00:57:54 Speaker 1  Everybody had a good summer.  00:57:59 Speaker 3  Thank you you guys too.  00:58:18 Speaker 2  Oh. Oh, Claire's here. That's fine. OK. Alright. So. Oh, yeah. Sorry. M\u2019s momo, I think we were talking about. Wait one SEC. There we go. OK. Yeah. From your perspective, how can we make the AI responses more relevant to? You. That's that's the question you were Discussing 00:58:42 Speaker 4   right and. I remember we were just talking about it and then it. Went off.  00:58:49 Speaker 2  I know, I know. UM.  00:58:57 Speaker 4  To make the AI more relevant. Well, I think Jim and I picks up where maybe the glasses lets off or Alexa lets where the different devices stop. Gemini picks up and it gives. And another opportunity like if you can't get the answer from your phone on just because from my era and I I was new to Google, we would just start Googling everything and now it's almost as if you don't need to Google anymore, you can just. Ask Jim and I and you'll get an instant response. And for M, who grew up with all of the technology. It's so easy for him just to ask his glasses or because he's wearing them most times and he will say. Well, I need my glasses to see and so cause it tells him the information that he needs more so than just asking the phone anymore. If the glasses isn't giving the answer quick enough, he can ask Gemini.  01:00:07 Speaker 2  Yes. OK. So like different tools will give different kind of responses and there were one thought if one thought short something there's another platform to pick up and and try that for asking that particular question. OK. That makes sense. Alright, so any any command examples that you can specifically share when it comes to you know how 11 platform will let let off and then you know some some other platform would pick up. Is there a specific example?  01:00:46 Speaker 4  Think of is the calendar if you ask. On. S on the phone? Yeah. What am I doing today or what's on my calendar? Yeah, might say. Ohh. You have 3 events today.  01:01:01 Speaker 2  MHM.  01:01:02 Speaker 4  And you can say what are the events you have 3 events today, whereas if you ask Alexa, she was. If you have 3 events today at 8:00 you are going to the brain and at 10:00 you have a dental appointment. It will give, it will literally read your calendar to you.  01:01:09 Speaker 2  Correct. 01:01:21 Speaker 4   And then the downfall is Gemini won't go into your calendar unless they have access.  01:01:27 Speaker 2  Yeah. Can you think of something other way around where where AI or Gemini where and the glasses would pick up and and wear Alexa or S would not respond to or not respond appropriately? Are there any topics or or examples like that?  01:01:58 Speaker 4  Well. With the glasses, M can. He's really good. Like with playing a lot of his music and then asking questions about the author who wrote the song, or when did it come out or. Yeah, play something similar to it and it's all linked to his.To the Apple music, right, and which is on this phone whereas. The A Alexa is more linked to. Amazon Music.  01:02:30 Speaker 2  Right.  01:02:35 Speaker 4  And I would guess he we haven't done it, but actually we kind of did it in a roundabout way, asking Jim and I about certain things related to that song. You could get it, and especially like if the if the song is from a movie, for example, when we were at the museum. In Los Angeles last weekend, he could have said what is the theme song from Casablanca? That type of thing, and he would have gotten that from Jim and I and probably got more information from Gemini than from his bosses.  01:03:06 Speaker 2  Got it. OK. OK. Alright. Makes sense. So we're interested in designing the AI response to be more interactive. So imagine like a virtual clinician for you to help you with your needs. So when this training is not on, say you need it. You know, any any anything that you need, like a virtual clinician for what kinds of help would you like to receive from this kind of agent?  01:03:39 Speaker 4  Well, I think what M did tonight when we were doing those examples with his hair, yes. And he asked, like, how do I comb my hair? Because that's one thing. And he asked, I give. I've done my hair properly. Yeah. And he asked that follow up question how do I apply the type of guy and then the hair gel. That was all very relevant. To a 25 year old.  01:04:01 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  01:04:02 Speaker 4  And so I think that was very appropriate. I could see the virtual. I mean they worked with Gemini in doing that, right,  Speaker 2 right, right .  01:04:16 Speaker 4  And More so, like, stuff like that.  01:04:20 Speaker 4 How do I and I would guess you could even say something like how do I brush my teeth to make sure I clean? Them all or .   01:04:28 Speaker 2  yeahYeah. So would you say that when it comes to like a virtual agent or a virtual clinician, it would be more of providing ideas of what kind of questions and what kind of content he could ask for so that the? He could use the platforms or the tools to the fullest. Of its ability.  01:04:51 Speaker 4  I think so, yeah. Because I think the biggest difference is M has a TBI and so. And me being older and so I'm having to try to figure it out. Compared to someone like Peter, for example, who is closer in age to M, who doesn't have a TBI, I'm sure he just can come up with stuff like. This whereas M starting to get back to that type of way, whereas me it's a whole new learning experience.  01:05:24 Speaker 2  Right. Correct, correct. OK, alright. That makes so much sense. Thank you for sharing that. OK so. UM, what information do you want to share with this kind of virtual agent, or what information do you want the agent to learn so that it could help you with the homework or with the training of the of this training?  01:05:54 Speaker 4  I think the more you use the AI, the more the AI learns about you. So, for instance, with M's glasses, he can ask a question like.  01:06:07 Speaker 3  I'm blind.  01:06:08 Speaker 4  Hey Maida, what am I looking at? And Maida will give a description. And M can say remember Mata, I'm blind and my Maida will then give a more comprehensive description as yeah, he's looking at. And so the AI responds to that. When you say, remember, I'm blind or I am blind. What am I looking at? Yeah, I am blind. Is it safe to cross the street?That's not a good example because they won't. No AI will tell you it's safe to cross the street. That's a safety issue, but it might say, are there any cars in the vicinity? Yes. She's fine.  01:06:50 Speaker 3  See.  01:06:50 Speaker 4  Yeah, she's right there. She's OK. She was asking about the dog, but I think. Yeah. So no way I will tell you. Yes, you can cross the street, but they can tell you if you stay on. Remember, I'm blind. What is on the sign above me? It will read the sign more detail. 01:07:08 Speaker 2  Yeah. And it's almost like it. You want to learn your own history and your own like to remember the facts about about yourself and and then respond appropriately, you know.  01:07:26 Speaker 4  Yes, definitely. M saying the dog.  01:07:28 Speaker 2  Up. Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, I'm almost. I I should be done. I guess so.  01:07:34 Speaker 4  It's just.  01:07:38 Speaker 2  What what would be ideal interaction between between M and the agent? So a a virtual agent like that who would be helping with, you know, maintaining their learnings from this kind of training?  01:07:55 Speaker 4  Ohh, I noticed that when M uses Gemini. He would say things like thank you and Gemini responds back. You're welcome, that type of thing and it's more conversational and and even with follow up questions on both ways, whether it's from M or from the agent when they were asking about. The weather in Africa. And M said, well, how's about in, you know, Tanzania? He went to the different places assistant, and then she, he said thank you. She said you're welcome that makes a. Difference I think because it's just part of a typical conversation, because even with Alexa, he'll say, oh, thank you, Alexa. And there's no response. Siri responds back. But. Does Maida respond back to you, Maida?  01:08:47 Speaker 3  Nope.  01:08:48 Speaker 2  Doesn't does not OK.  01:08:51 Speaker 4  Sorry does but Alexa and the glasses don't say, oh, you're. Welcome. 01:08:55 Speaker 2  Yeah. And I think the other difference when he was asking about the weather, he he asked, what's the weather in, you know, Tanzania and then? For for the other two locations, he did not see. The whole question. It was like, how about in, you know, Uganda? Or how about in Kenya? So it doesn't even like it remembers like it contextually remembers what the context was and what he was asking. In the question. Previously and then kind of repeats and makes up the context on its own which which which is different from how a? Or S would be in this. Given situation.  01:09:36 Speaker 4  And with the person with the TBI. That's a lot easier because having to remember a big long prompt, yeah, a lot different than being able to have it, more like a conversation.  01:09:49 Speaker 2  Exactly. Yes. All right. Well, that that really that this it actually. Yeah. Is there anything else you would like to share with us?  Speaker 3 Nope Speaker 2 He's he's like I'm done. Can you can you just, like, be done now? I'm. I'm just so done right, M.  01:10:08 Speaker 1  M, I just want to say thank you so much for another great summer. You taught us so much about AI.  01:10:14 Speaker 2  I feel yes the same way I think and you've done so well since the past year. I think I see huge, huge. I mean I think gains in your skills and your language and your speech especially I think it's. It's really wonderful.  01:10:31 Speaker 4  What do you say, M?  01:10:32 Speaker 3  Thank you.  01:10:35 Speaker 1  And thank you so much for everything you're doing to support her mom. And we cannot do this without you every summer. And we love seeing you all making really great explorations and trying out new things with us and learning from these new available free tools. And yeah, it's been great. Summer. Is there anything like I'll. I'll follow up on the gift card. Got your e-mail and they'll probably do it in waves. And is there anything else you'd like us to follow up with or if you're interested in maybe doing more of the lessons in the fall and spring semester we're planning and thinking about that because we have a few people on the.  01:11:16 Speaker 4  Just in mind, because we're learning a lot from it as well. I mean, truthfully, Alexa has been a godsend for M because it's making him more independent. All of these different technologies and the AI, it is helping M become more independent and it's helping us. It's kind of. Think outside the box as well, and that's been wonderful. So we've truly appreciate. Every time you've offered to us, we really do.  01:11:44 Speaker 1  Thank you. M, we're all done. We'll let you go eat your dinner. Thank you so much for being very patient. With us, bye.  01:11:52 Speaker 4  Thank you so much. We appreciate all your help. Thank you. Bye bye.        \nWEBVTT   00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:13.963 Thank you. All right. Um, so Michael, tell me how\u2026 how is it going? Have you tried using Gemini at all? Like, this.  00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:19.784 Past week\u2026 Yeah.  00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.442 Yeah. Me and my mom are on the beach on Tuesday.  00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:25.522 And she asked me to use Gemini to find out what we were looking at.  00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.359 Sorry, where were you at? Did you go somewhere, you said?  00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:31.973 And I asked Gemini what we were looking at.  00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.945 Oh, okay. Oh, that was\u2026 that was the week before, is that correct?  00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970 Alessio Beach.  00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.465 Yeah. As well as this week.  00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360 I'm still on summer break for a week, so we've been going to the beach at least weekly.  00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.951 Oh, this week too, okay, okay. So that was new, um\u2026  00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:57.477 That's nice. Okay, okay, I got it. Um, so then\u2026 Um, how was it different from the first time?  00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:08.154 Ask Gemini to tell me what we're looking at. And we're on live. She said it looks like you guys are at the beach.  00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:13.396 And then\u2026 You said\u2026 do you guys\u2026 are you guys having fun?  00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:20.021 I said, yeah. She asked if we're having fun the first week that we asked her.  00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.770 Okay. Okay, okay.  00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:26.844 She did not ask that the second week. Did say it looks like you're at the beach.  00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.840 Got it, okay. Did it say anything about the weather, or what's in the environment, or\u2026 nothing, just about\u2026 just that.  00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.750 We were\u2026  00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710 You are at the beach, that's all.  00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:57.963 Yeah, and it also, like, it picked up, um\u2026 the legs, uh, I think it picked up Michael's legs, because he was holding the phone, and so it said it in the four\u2026 ground, it shows the, um, feet or legs, something along those lines, as well.  00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150 Uh-huh.  00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:02.216 And also, it\u2026 it took in the whole view of what it seemed.  00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.014 Got it.  00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.829 We were trying to compare it, or I was trying to compare it to an app called Be My Eyes.  00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.141 Mmm\u2026  00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.740 Which is, um\u2026 amount that the blind community uses.  00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:15.674 Okay.  00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:21.389 Okay? Uh-huh.  00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790 And you can hold up your phone with be my eyes on it.  00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:33.660 Or you can use it through your glasses. And it will be my eyes is where you can call a\u2026 volunteer, and they will describe what's going on around you. So it's a good person.  00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:37.811 So, I was just trying to compare it to different things on the phone.  00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:37.664 What's going on? Okay.  00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:57.583 Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting, okay. All right, okay. So, would you say that that was a better fit when you wanted to\u2026 sort of see something, um, or ask\u2026 about information about any picture or anything that's, like, live in front of him?  00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:02.644 I'd say live is really good, to be honest with you.  00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:07.503 Um, the other thing we used it for, remember in the car when we were driving?  00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.085 Okay.  00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:16.089 Michael's dad is from Australia. He was telling Michael a story about a ship.  00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:16.942 Oh?  00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:20.672 That was a boat that was shipwrecked in, like, the 70s.  00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:30.241 And so, we asked Gemini. What boat was shipwrecked in Brisbane, Australia in the 70s?  00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.802 Okay.  00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:38.627 And within seconds. It came back with the name and blah blah blah, and my husband's going, that's exactly right.  00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:44.204 And it was some obscure thing that happened in the 70s.  00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.729 Oh, okay.  00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.069 Great. Yeah, yeah, so it's really digging information from.  00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.280 That really didn't make worldwide news.  00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:59.934 Like, even the\u2026 so much, so many years back, so which is\u2026 which is great. And it's a\u2026 and the good part is that it was accurate.  00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:08.849 Yes. And it was\u2026 it was\u2026 it was for an obscure fact. It wasn't\u2026 you know, like, when was World War II?  00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.776 Yeah.  00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:14.285 Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, nice, that's\u2026 that's very good to know. Okay, I'm gonna share my screen.  00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:26.526 So, we can, um\u2026 get on with this. Um, so this is going to be a little different from last year. We're just gonna do a final review.  00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:39.654 Where, um, so we're just gonna review each week's learnings, and then\u2026 Um, I'll provide you with, like, an open-ended prompt for any, like, that particular topic of the week.  00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:54.649 And then we'll, um\u2026 both of us together, Michael, or even Mom, uh, we can come up with, um, two voice commands per topic and practice those using either Alexa, Gemini, or even for you, your glasses.  00:04:54.925 --> 00:05:02.925 Whichever is the best fit. Um\u2026 based on the command that you want to, or the activity that you want to practice.  00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:17.924 Okay? Alright, so\u2026 Um\u2026 So, let's see where we\u2026 we start here. Um, so this is information seeking. That was the first topic that we discussed.  00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:09.137 Okay.  00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:25.391 And, um, the topics that were covered during that week was about asking about the weather.  00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:35.542 Making and, uh, deleting to-do lists. Um, adding events to a calendar, local, uh, asking about local and international news.  00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:43.551 Um, and information related to sporting events, or any kind of other information that you're curious about, you could ask.  00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:47.508 Those are sort of, like, the broad topics that we covered.  00:05:47.575 --> 00:06:00.575 For information seeking that week. So, let's find two tasks that you would like to, um\u2026 practice related to information seeking, and practice those using either Gemini.  00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:07.528 Um, your glasses or Alexa. So, let's see, what you pick, and then we'll decide based on that.  00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:14.677 What would you like to do, Michael? When's it gonna rain next?  00:06:11.664 --> 00:06:13.664 If that makes sense.  00:06:14.344 --> 00:06:21.344 Okay, so to ask about the weather, which, um\u2026 What platform do you think would be better? Gemini.  00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.611 Gemini? Okay, just let me open my phone.  00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:40.977 Are you asking about the weather, um, in your area, or is there somewhere you're going, or you're curious about?  00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.630 Local, or do you want to find out where your sister's at?  00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:54.714 State weather. Okay. Okay, um\u2026 go like this, I'll turn the volume up high so she can hear.  00:06:55.135 --> 00:07:02.135 Okay, you ready? Yeah. Hey, Gemini. What is the local state weather?  00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:10.995 In state, it's 83 and sunny. Today, it'll be sunny, with a high of 86 and a low of 60.  00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:18.658 Is it gonna rain soon? Currently, there's no chance of rain.  00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:26.851 Does that make sense?  00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:29.842 Okay, very good.  00:07:29.356 --> 00:07:38.356 That's perfect, okay. All right. What did you, um\u2026 Is that very\u2026 where your sister lives, or what did you say?  00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.319 You'd like to know if it's going\u2026  00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:44.075 Now, I asked, um, if Micah wanted to ask where his sister is, because his sister is in Africa right now.  00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:55.414 Oh, okay. Oh, okay, okay, got it, got it. Okay, that was really good, Michael. I think you did a great job, and I think it picked up.  00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.882 So, if you want to ask about the weather, where she's at.  00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:07.700 Your, um, command really easily, and it provides\u2026 it seems like it provided the, uh, appropriate, uh, weather conditions and everything, and\u2026 Also, chances of rain, so that's\u2026 that's great.  00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:11.404 Good job asking a follow-up question, Michael, that was very good.  00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:22.272 Yeah. All right, let's find another task that\u2026 or another task or activity related to information seeking that you'd like to ask.  00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:30.996 You know what you want to ask? Yeah, Gemini, what's your favorite color? No, no, no, let's not do favorite color, let's think information setting.  00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:38.595 There's something in the world, something global, something\u2026 else. Hey, Gemini, what's the weather like in Africa?  00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:45.512 Nope, it's capped the phone.  00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:52.553 In Gemini, what's the weather like in Africa? Africa's a big place, so the weather varies a lot.  00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:56.397 It could be hot and dry in the Sahara, or warm and humid in the Congo.  00:08:55.961 --> 00:09:00.961 Do you have a specific country or city in mind? Tanzania.  00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:08.254 Okay, in Tanzania, it's currently 71 degrees and partly cloudy. It's going to be mostly sunny.  00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:11.556 With a high of 82 and a low of 69 degrees.  00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.789 About Kenya.  00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.800 Okay, in Nairobi, Kenya, it's currently 55 degrees and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 77 degrees.  00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:29.612 And the low is 54 degrees. In Uganda?  00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:39.867 Okay, in Kampala, Uganda, it's currently 64 degrees and partly cloudy. The high is going to be 81 degrees.  00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:46.762 And the low is 63 degrees. Hi, is anyone who's above 64?  00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:51.214 Those are the three places his sister is going to be.  00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:49.397 That's great.  00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:56.810 Okay, that makes sense, okay, way to go, like, with asking all those follow-ups, Michael, again.  00:09:56.276 --> 00:10:20.276 Great job. Okay, so that\u2026 I think the live is working much better, um, when\u2026 whenever he's using Gemini. I guess when\u2026 in the first session, when we were trying to do the weather-related questions, it was\u2026 It was not taking the place, remember the location, and then we had to sort of say the location.  00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:03.795 Thank you.  00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:26.029 I think doing live makes. Like, I think it\u2026 it catches the location.  00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:34.205 I agree, and I think live for Michael especially, is a lot easier.  00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.689 On its own, or some\u2026 yeah.  00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:41.090 Because when you're not on live. You have to touch the button at the bottom.  00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.042 Mm-hmm.  00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:48.651 For the microphone, and then\u2026 If you want to stop, you have to find the stop button at the top of the phone.  00:10:45.503 --> 00:10:47.503 Yeah.  00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:56.225 And when you use VoiceOver, you can do that, but you have to go through a\u2026 it will read every single section.  00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:03.565 Live, you just touch the screen anywhere, and away you go. Touch the screen again, and it stops.  00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:01.361 Yeah. Right.  00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:12.886 Yeah, that's\u2026 that is really good. I think, um, yeah, I'm glad we found that, and found it really quick early on in the training, so that has helped a lot, I feel.  00:11:16.874 --> 00:11:23.874 And Michael can also ask S\u2026 You know, who asks this? To open up that app.  00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.390 Alright, um, so we'll move on. All right.  00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:26.299 Yeah. Okay.  00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.216 And then go to live, and it will just do it.  00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:32.454 Okay, alright, so that's even better, because if no one's around.  00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:36.088 You\u2026 he could always do that, right, Michael? Like, you can ask.  00:11:36.514 --> 00:11:45.514 Your phone\u2026 phone's assistant. Starting with us, and just say that open\u2026 or, like, start live on\u2026 on Gemini or something.  00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:45.301 Yeah.  00:11:46.189 --> 00:12:00.189 Okay. Alright. Okay, so Michael, the next topic we, um, we talked about was entertainment. Um, this was, I think, on one of the Tuesdays that you were not, um, not here, and you were at your therapy session.  00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.123 Yeah.  00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:14.426 So, from last year, you might remember that we talked about the different topics under entertainment. Um, it was related to searching information, related to media, listening to music, watching movies.  00:12:14.343 --> 00:12:24.343 Um, with Gemini and AI tools, you can also generate stories and generate any content, like, generate new content and new stories.  00:12:24.362 --> 00:12:32.362 Um, and you can also, um, tell jokes, um, and play trivia games like you were able to on Alexa.  00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:39.510 So, um, if you were to do two tasks related to entertainment, what would you pick.  00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:49.473 Vendetta, the movie?  00:12:45.762 --> 00:12:54.762 Okay. Alright, so, um, and what would you\u2026 which platform would you use? Which tool you would use for that?  00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:05.997 It could be your glasses, or Gemini, or even Alexa, or your phone's assistant.  00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:14.116 On us, Gemini. A Gemini, who made the VFA Vendetta movie?  00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:13.441 Okay, alright, let's try.  00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:24.271 B for Vendetta was directed by James McTeague, but the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis, who are famous for the Matrix movies.  00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:32.291 Is that correct, Michael? Okay. All right.  00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:37.776 Yeah. Michael, what do you use on a\u2026 multiple times during the day.  00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:46.716 With your glasses, what do you ask your glasses? No, you don't. What do you do multiple times? And I have to ask you to please stop.  00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:51.879 Timer? No. Play. Play games. No.  00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.500 Play your\u2026 Music. Play his music. Multiple times.  00:13:59.164 --> 00:14:05.164 He uses his glasses a lot to play his music, because it will play music from.  00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:04.972 Okay.  00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:10.738 Apple Music. Apple Music, or from Amazon. It'll\u2026 he has to tell it.  00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:24.661 Okay, alright. Do you want to try using one of those commands and see, um\u2026 so when you, when you use that command, does it\u2026 That will directly come via your earphones of the\u2026 of your glasses, correct?  00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.555 And\u2026  00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:33.879 Okay. Alright, we can try that. That works. Okay? Whenever you're ready.  00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:30.662 Yeah. Yeah.  00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:41.563 What do you want to listen to? It's on my phone. Okay.  00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.290 And whatever music you want to play.  00:14:45.962 --> 00:14:50.962 Can you say the command? Is it playing the music automatically? Yeah.  00:14:55.403 --> 00:14:57.403 It's playing the music automatically.  00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:06.889 Playing, sometimes Michael will say, um. He'll think of a song that he would like to hear, so he'll say, play whatever by whoever.  00:14:58.055 --> 00:15:00.055 Okay, so without even\u2026  00:15:06.803 --> 00:15:12.803 And the glasses will just play it. Or sometimes we could be in a store.  00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:12.805 Yeah.  00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:19.325 And you know how they play music in the stores? He can say, hey, Maida, what song is playing?  00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:25.930 And it made it will come back and tell him the name and author of whatever song is playing in the store.  00:15:23.468 --> 00:15:25.468 Mm-hmm.  00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:38.825 Okay, got it. So right now, I think it just heard us talking about playing music, and\u2026 Even Michael confirming that he wanted to play music, and then it just started playing music.  00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:52.976 Okay, got it. Alright, Michael, can you try changing a song or, um, giving it another command, which might help us kind of see how it works?  00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.735 Yes. Turn your music off on.  00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:58.223 Ask for something specific. Played double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:09.445 Is it working? Okay.  00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.519 Yeah. Here's\u2026 it just said, here's double up by Nipsey Hussle.  00:16:11.528 --> 00:16:19.528 And so, what is the default when it comes to playing music? So, right now, like.  00:16:19.494 --> 00:16:36.494 Michael, you did not specify. That you're wanting to play on Amazon Music or, um, you know, something else, or Apple Music or anything. So how\u2026 Does it just take\u2026 any of those, um, platforms, or does it ask you?  00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:42.044 That there's double up on Nipsey Hussle. From Apple Music.  00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:47.264 So that must be the default, it goes straight to his Apple Music.  00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:47.882 Okay.  00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:50.669 Apple Music, okay. Makes sense.  00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:53.846 Did you put that in a playlist on your phone? Oh, and it was already on his phone, too.  00:16:54.572 --> 00:17:10.572 Got it, okay, great, makes sense. Alright, Michael, that's pretty good. Um, anything else you'd like to, um\u2026 do using Gemini especially, because I know you were not here during this particular, um.  00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:26.825 Topic training, so I wanted to see, um\u2026 like, you know, if you wanted to generate a story, or\u2026 I don't know if you've ever used to generate content like that, um\u2026 And if you were interested in doing that with Gemini.  00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:21.251 You know.  00:17:26.022 --> 00:17:31.022 Say you wanted to, like, you know, listen to a story.  00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:48.518 Specifically on, you know, um, your favorite animals, or, like, you know, something like\u2026 like, you know, anything it could be, or it could be, like, a day at the beach, or, you know, something\u2026 some of your favorite action movies or something.  00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:56.539 You could try using that and see if\u2026 Um, you give it a few details, and if it would come up with a story.  00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:06.675 For you. So, you want to tell us what you want to listen to first, and then maybe once, you know, that life starts and you can say it?  00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.548 Okay.  00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:12.679 I'm not\u2026 I can\u2026 or her to\u2026 Give me a short story about the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:19.604 Okay, yeah.  00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:25.549 Can you create a short story? Uh\u2026 short story for\u2026 For me, from the V for Vendetta movie.  00:18:27.682 --> 00:18:33.682 In a dystopian London, a masked vigilante named V fights against a totalitarian regime.  00:18:33.797 --> 00:18:37.797 He rescues a young woman named Evie, and introduces her to his world of revolution.  00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:43.069 As they work together, Evie learns about V's past, and his plans to ignite a rebellion against the oppressive government.  00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:48.709 In the end, V's actions inspired the people. Thanks, Bill.  00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:52.868 Is that good? Yep. Is that what the movie was about? Yep.  00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:54.175 Yeah?  00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:58.054 Is that\u2026 is that the only information that came up, or was it, like, very long?  00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:05.397 I have to go back, just give me a sec.  00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:08.026 Oh. Oh, okay, okay. I was just curious.  00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:17.712 No, it was quite short. If you can\u2026 See that?  00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:27.939 Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay, that's pretty short, yeah. So it's like a few sentences, like, maybe, like, 3 to 4 sentences, which\u2026  00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:37.178 5 sentences, okay, alright. That's not too bad, it's definitely, like\u2026 much better than, like, you know, asking for news that time.  00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:32.659 Yep, I'd say 3, um, maybe about 5.  00:19:37.373 --> 00:19:52.373 And it, like, giving a bunch of information instead of, like, just\u2026 you know, trying to give you the gist of it, and this seems like almost\u2026 or just\u2026 or the summary of the entire movie, or the, you know, just the plot of the movie.  00:20:26.383 --> 00:20:38.383 You know? Yeah, that would be nice. Alright, so\u2026 Moving on, um, the third week, or the third session, was, um, self-care and medical needs.  00:20:31.252 --> 00:20:33.252 Yeah.  00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:44.486 So, uh, we\u2026 here we discussed, uh, topics related to medication management.  00:20:44.449 --> 00:20:54.449 Creating medication lists and finding medications. Um, searching for self-care tips, such as laundry or caring for a loved one or.  00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:58.178 And we asked a bunch of questions about your pet the last time.  00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:04.410 Um, and tips to improve mental and physical health, and searching for home remedies if you.  00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:12.798 Um, if you needed something. So, now, based on these topics, let's, um, find two activities again.  00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:23.810 Uh, related to self-care and medical needs, and then, um, we can practice those, and we'll base it on which, um, tool or platform to use, based on what you want to.  00:21:27.226 --> 00:21:32.226 Gemini? Okay, and what are you going to ask? And right from my head. Oh!  00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:29.766 Practice.  00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:38.175 What's that? Okay, alright.  00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.940 Could you say it louder so that I can hear it? Oh, I don't want to hear.  00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.400 How do I comb my hair?  00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:51.599 Well, there are a few ways to approach it. You could start by figuring out what kind of style you're going for.  00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:55.101 Do you want something classic, trendy, or maybe a bit edgy?  00:21:55.231 --> 00:22:05.231 Trendy. Okay, for something trendy, you could try a textured crop with a matte finish. Or, if you have longer hair.  00:22:05.238 --> 00:22:10.238 A messy quiff might work. Do either of those sound like something you'd like to try? What's a messy quiff?  00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:19.147 A messy quiff is a hairstyle that's shorter on the sides and back, but with longer hair on top that's styled upwards and slightly messy.  00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:25.238 It's a pretty popular look right now.  00:22:25.732 --> 00:22:29.732 You're welcome. Do you need help finding a good barber or salon? No, thanks.  00:22:32.524 --> 00:22:50.524 That is great! I wonder, um, that was\u2026 that was really good back-and-forth conversation, I think, and, um, things that I\u2026 that are\u2026 that are most amazing, I feel, and those are the differences between using, like, a.  00:22:50.728 --> 00:23:02.728 Alexa or Siri, versus, um, you know, Gemini, is, you know, even if there is hesitations or interruptions, uh, when a command is being presented.  00:23:02.535 --> 00:23:16.535 To that tool, it still picks up. Um, it doesn't\u2026 it's not very quick to say, oh, I did not understand. So the, um, the speech recognition is so much better, I think, like, that\u2026 and it leads to less frustration.  00:23:16.623 --> 00:23:21.623 Um. Yes, for sure.  00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:23.671 Great, and it's more social.  00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:34.959 Definitely more social, because it's asking good follow-up questions, too. Um, like, for example, right now, with the barber and, you know, finding something, and, um, just the back and forth, it feels more human, too.  00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:44.209 Um, and less robotic. So\u2026 Yeah.  00:23:37.094 --> 00:23:42.094 I have\u2026 I've noticed that\u2026 Um, the A device.  00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:47.991 Is the\u2026 is slowly getting a little bit more personable as well.  00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:56.568 Because, for example, tonight, um, Michael asked her to set a timer, and before she did, she said, good evening, Mike.  00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:54.034 Hmm\u2026  00:23:57.938 --> 00:24:00.938 Um, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes, or whatever it was.  00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:02.149 Oh.  00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:10.010 That's good, okay. Yeah, so it's definitely\u2026 it's getting into those greetings and a little bit of personalization.  00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:17.552 Based on who's talking to it, instead of, like, just. You know, generally answering like it would. So, yeah.  00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:25.740 That makes sense. Okay. Alright, Michael, what would be the next, uh, second task for you, uh, related to self-care and medical needs?  00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:32.102 Say, hey, Gemini, how do I put gel in my hair?  00:24:39.993 --> 00:24:41.993 Not that one? Yeah. Okay, one sec.  00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:51.767 Hey Jim, I thought I'd put gel in my hair. Okay, here's how to put gel in your hair. Start with a small amount, about a pea-sized drop, and rub it between your palms.  00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:57.500 Apply it evenly, working from the roots to the ends. Style as desired, and add more gel if needed.  00:24:58.782 --> 00:25:02.782 Yeah, thanks. I'll do that. Gemini?  00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:08.971 Okay. Four tips on styling it. Great, thank you, I will.  00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:09.974 That's good, okay.  00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:21.368 Okay. All right, perfect. Um\u2026 Okay, so the next one, um, next topic was meal preparation and cooking. Again, that one.  00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:30.229 Uh, was when, uh, on one of the\u2026 on past Tuesday, actually, when you were not around, so we can probably practice some of the commands from.  00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:34.949 Maybe last year you remember how we talked about making shopping lists.  00:25:34.225 --> 00:25:44.225 Um, by adding or viewing or, um, listing the items that were on the shopping list, and then removing items.  00:25:44.728 --> 00:25:51.728 Um, we could find recipes, um. Or find recipes related to some certain dietary restrictions.  00:25:52.986 --> 00:26:00.986 Whether it could be, um, gluten-free or vegan, um, or another one of the dietary restrictions that, um, some people might have.  00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:08.125 Finding nutritional facts about different foods, for example, number of grams of sugar or sodium.  00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:14.337 In a particular food item, um, finding calories in certain\u2026 some kind of food.  00:26:14.563 --> 00:26:23.563 Um, finding the ingredients for cooking a specific food. And then following the recipe and, like, instruction by instruction or step by step.  00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:31.177 So, based on all of those ideas, let's find two activities related to meal preparation.  00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:40.224 Um, before you do, I wanted to ask you, is there\u2026 Particularly anything that has changed from the past year that.  00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:47.858 You've been contributing more towards, uh, when it comes to meal preparation. Is there\u2026 Are there things that have changed?  00:26:47.258 --> 00:26:51.258 Um, while you are in the kitchen with your parents, or.  00:26:54.425 --> 00:26:58.425 Yeah, well, I came home from the Army. And\u2026 they weren't with me.  00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.330 You know, while you're helping them prep.  00:26:58.248 --> 00:27:09.248 So, that's a big change. Michael, what about, um, when going to Costco, what have you been doing more of?  00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:21.379 Putting the list on what? Okay? Yes. He's been making the list for us on\u2026 And then when we're at\u2026 for example, Costco.  00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:19.963 Okay.  00:27:21.942 --> 00:27:27.942 Because it comes with glasses, he will just say\u2026 I'll say to him, here's, you know, the strawberries, the bananas.  00:27:28.365 --> 00:27:34.365 And he'll tell her. Check off strawberries, check off bananas, that kind of thing. Interesting.  00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:40.673 Okay, so mainly manage\u2026 making and managing lists. Uh, for shopping is something that you do.  00:27:40.914 --> 00:27:53.914 Um, and I think, um, A is a perfect solution when it comes to something like that, or even\u2026 even the phone's assistant, um, S would do a better job, I guess, because it would directly put.  00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:59.265 On the notes, um, section, um, and make a list there, so that makes sense.  00:27:59.647 --> 00:28:06.647 Um, so let\u2026 do you think you want to try making a list? Or, like, is there something that you want to add to?  00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:13.252 Um, your shopping list, um, that we could, we could practice now, or is there something else that you would like to do?  00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:19.483 Michael, do you want to make a list, or do you want to\u2026 Yeah, I would like to make a list.  00:28:25.682 --> 00:28:27.682 Should I go to Alexa?  00:28:27.403 --> 00:28:31.403 Yeah, yeah, you can, uh, I think your mom's just getting Alexa\u2026  00:28:33.821 --> 00:28:35.821 Sure.  00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:49.434 Michael's phone is having some major technical difficulties. That on the side has broken off, so\u2026 We're waiting, kind of, for his sister to get back, so I can change the plan and the phones and everything.  00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:38.275 Oh, your iPad, okay, yeah.  00:28:42.845 --> 00:28:44.845 Oh!  00:28:56.498 --> 00:28:58.498 It's one of those things.  00:28:56.698 --> 00:29:03.698 Too many things when there's too\u2026 so many technologies together at use, so\u2026  00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.400 As your daughter gets older, you'll understand my pain.  00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:15.030 Okay, Michael, it's ready. Yeah, let's see\u2026 Add marshmallows to my Costco list.  00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:09.933 I know, I know.  00:29:20.352 --> 00:29:26.352 Okay, um, so are you\u2026 are you\u2026 are you managing, like, multiple lists?  00:29:21.321 --> 00:29:23.321 Marshmallows added to Costco.  00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:34.223 Because you said Costco list, so, um, are there, like. Different lists for different places that you usually manage?  00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:40.941 Yeah. What's the other one? Oops, Halbertson? Halbertson's.  00:29:44.014 --> 00:29:48.014 Go ahead. Hey, Alexa.  00:29:45.364 --> 00:29:48.364 Okay. Makes sense.  00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:54.663 Add cookies to my Albertson's most. Cookies added to Albertsons?  00:29:54.448 --> 00:30:05.448 Okay, perfect. That's really good. Um, anything else that you do with respect to meal preparation when you're in the kitchen?  00:30:05.706 --> 00:30:11.706 Um, with your dad or your mom while they're cooking, or before they start to cook?  00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:21.180 Hey, Alexa, I'd pass to the Albertsons list. That's the pasta on the olives.  00:30:22.374 --> 00:30:28.374 What else do you do, though, to help? Michael sometimes helps with, like, cutting or that type of thing.  00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:35.974 Oh, okay. Um, do you have any questions when you\u2026 when you have to do anything of that sort related to it?  00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:44.315 No, this guy, Cesar, he's my OT specialist. Got me some gloves that are pretty nice.  00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:55.245 Um, Michael sets a lot of timers, as well. For a meal. Tonight, you set a timer for the pizza, right?  00:30:48.645 --> 00:30:50.645 Okay. All right.  00:30:57.114 --> 00:30:58.114 Okay.  00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:14.808 Right. Like, how much, like, that would tell you, um, how much time you should boil something for, or, like, just steam something for, and just put a timer, and then\u2026 Okay. Got it. Alright, but that's pretty good. Like, I think managing lists was\u2026  00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:01.869 Um.  00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:20.588 It was definitely great. Um, do you\u2026 do you have anything else that you would like to find out, like.  00:31:20.917 --> 00:31:30.917 Um, finding caloric, um, calories in foods, or nutritional facts about any food that you'd like to ask, and maybe we could, this time try to use Gemini.  00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:36.243 And see if that works, and how that would work, because we've not gotten to practice this part.  00:31:38.064 --> 00:31:43.064 Okay? What question are you going to ask?  00:31:44.679 --> 00:31:49.679 How much sugar is in the cookies I eat? What can cookies are you talking about?  00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:56.206 Symptoms. Okay. To make sure\u2026 specific on the type, okay?  00:32:02.792 --> 00:32:04.792 How much sugar is in the Tim Tams?  00:32:04.606 --> 00:32:09.606 I couldn't find how much sugar is in Tim Tams. You might be able to find that information on the nutrition label.  00:32:09.863 --> 00:32:14.863 On the packaging, or on the manufacturer's website. Okay, thank you.  00:32:15.163 --> 00:32:19.163 Hey, Gemini. Much sugar is in the mono?  00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:27.259 Okay, according to the official Milo website, a cup of Milo has about 1 teaspoon of added sugar.  00:32:27.127 --> 00:32:33.127 That's on top of the natural sugars from the milk and malt barley. Does that answer your question? Yeah, it does. Thank you.  00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:40.363 Okay, so that's good. I mean, if it doesn't have\u2026 an answer to any question, then it will just say that.  00:32:40.548 --> 00:32:49.548 You know, it\u2026 I don't know about that. Yeah, and where to find it. Yeah, that's\u2026 that's really good.  00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:49.509 Yeah, and where to find it?  00:32:49.557 --> 00:33:02.557 Alright, so that's the end of our review. Um, let me stop sharing for a minute, and then\u2026 We'll move on to, um, some of the questions.  00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:11.716 That we have here, uh\u2026 okay. All right, um, so I'm just gonna ask.  00:33:11.962 --> 00:33:18.962 This was also the last time that we did the training that, um, we just asked questions about how you find the training.  00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:28.933 Um, what kind of problems or challenges you faced, and, um, just sharing about the AI in general, and the training satisfaction, etc, okay?  00:33:29.184 --> 00:33:35.184 So I'll start, Michael, with you, um, and Maureen, you can chime in anytime you, um.  00:33:35.064 --> 00:33:44.064 Anytime you think you wanted to contribute. So, some of these questions I'm starting with are related to AI satisfaction.  00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:55.920 So, was it difficult or easy for you to use your, um, AI? So, Gemini or your glasses, for that matter? We're going to take both into consideration, since.  00:33:56.342 --> 00:34:07.342 We've used both through the training, and you use those. I think you use your glasses a lot during your day-to-day life, so\u2026 tell me about it, how easy or difficult you think.  00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:12.691 I'm using in my glass store. Thank you, Gemini.  00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:19.450 Okay. Okay, so same with Gemini and ER glasses, it's easy for you to use them. Okay.  00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:26.969 I think both the glasses in Gemini pick up where. The A device.  00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:26.099 All right.  00:34:27.314 --> 00:34:34.314 Leaves off, basically. They all have their place, truly. They truly have their own place.  00:34:32.765 --> 00:34:34.765 Yeah.  00:34:34.195 --> 00:34:44.195 But I can see, um\u2026 For certain activities, one is better than the other, but if you can't get the answer on one, you can go to another. And that's nice, having that option.  00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:52.985 Yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, what specific problems. Um, have you faced with Gemini?  00:34:52.613 --> 00:35:07.613 Um, for example, does it have\u2026 difficulties understanding your speech, um, or does it have any difficulties understanding your language, or\u2026 or any sort of navigation issues that you've had with Gemini?  00:35:08.992 --> 00:35:13.992 There's not really any. Um, actually, no.  00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:20.792 When we were in the car on Tuesday, we asked a question, and it.  00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:29.900 Could not understand what we were asking. Um, so we had to rework it. I'm trying to think of what that question was. Me too.  00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:43.125 It had to do with that boat in Australia. We had to, um\u2026 I think it was the way the question was worded the first time, it was unable\u2026 it gave information, but it was not.  00:35:43.507 --> 00:35:50.507 Accurate. It was about something that happened somewhere else in Australia. But when we added, um\u2026 The Banana Beach?  00:35:51.473 --> 00:35:59.473 Yes, that's right. When we added Brisbane to it. Where we're a little bit more specific, it gave a more specific answer.  00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:04.696 Okay, makes sense. All right, so that.  00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:10.747 But when it comes to\u2026 so, you have to sometimes tweak your language and the words.  00:36:10.504 --> 00:36:15.504 Um, to make sure that it gives the information that you're looking for.  00:36:15.196 --> 00:36:27.196 That makes sense. Okay. All right, um\u2026 how about speech? I think\u2026 Is there any difficulty? Do you feel with respect to understanding of speech, or.  00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:41.874 Um, navigation with Gemini, I think ever since you found the live option, that\u2026 He could go live on Gemini. I think it's\u2026 it's really good. I guess the navigation has become much easier.  00:36:42.328 --> 00:36:46.328 Yes, it has. But remember last week when we were on live?  00:36:46.862 --> 00:36:53.862 Asked it a question, and they couldn't answer that question. Remember? I can't remember what it was for.  00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:52.611 Yeah.  00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:59.950 I can't remember what it was, but we were\u2026 we asked a question on live, and it said you have to go.  00:37:01.403 --> 00:37:09.403 Oh, oh, I think it was, like, um, asking us to link it to Google Workspace or something, and it was about the events.  00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:06.333 We don't have the capability yet to\u2026  00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:19.644 Um, trying to\u2026 Yeah, trying to set up events, um, and the same happened\u2026 What's that?  00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:16.866 Something along those lines, yeah.  00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:30.031 Calendar, yes, yes. It kind of told that, um, it would not be able to\u2026 yes, that\u2026 those kind of questions, I guess, are tasks where.  00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:24.785 On the calendar, that's right.  00:37:30.243 --> 00:37:35.243 It's linked to a certain calendar. If it does not have access to it, it's gonna have a hard time.  00:37:35.577 --> 00:37:57.577 Um, linking it, or, you know, that's going to be definitely there. So, when it comes to reminders, or scheduling appointments, or any of that, I guess, um\u2026 the others are much better, instead of, like, using AI, and I think you're already doing that, and it's\u2026 that's perfect, you know? Whatever's working is working, and\u2026  00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:06.250 We don't want to fix what's not broken, you know? So it's\u2026 That's\u2026 that's good. Um, alright. So\u2026 that's good.  00:38:06.698 --> 00:38:17.698 Um, what do you like most about having Gemini, Michael? Yeah. So the speech recognition part is very good.  00:38:14.901 --> 00:38:16.901 He understands me pretty well.  00:38:17.718 --> 00:38:26.718 Um, it's\u2026 it's a much\u2026 I think it's, um, it's much better when\u2026 when compared to last\u2026 last year's training with Alexa, I guess, because.  00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:47.030 You know, if there were words or names of movies. Um, people or topics, you know, or something like a proper noun. And I think it was not correctly pronounced, it would not take that, like, and it would\u2026 You know, we had so much reworking always with the commands that we used to do.  00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:54.733 Um, so that definitely is\u2026 it's really good. Um, and then what do you dislike the most about having Gemini?  00:38:55.526 --> 00:38:59.526 A good thing, too, is Gemini allows a bit of a pause.  00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:03.959 Um, a lot of times, your follow-up question has to be really quick.  00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:10.449 There's Gemini allows a little bit more of a pause, allows a little bit more time for that follow-up question.  00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:09.959 Yeah.  00:39:10.499 --> 00:39:16.499 Um, actually, and it allows a little bit more time than Michael's glasses allows.  00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:23.665 Oh, okay. So that's even a difference between those two, um, AI tools, I mean, in that case.  00:39:23.774 --> 00:39:34.774 That's great, okay. Um\u2026 Yeah, there's definitely, um\u2026 and sometimes if you, if, if you\u2026 talk too quickly after, you know, the.  00:39:34.753 --> 00:39:42.753 Um, after seeing the wake word, it still takes that information. Um, and if sometimes you don't say Gemini.  00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:50.310 And you start just talking when you're alive, it still takes up that information. You don't have to every time say that, which.  00:39:50.983 --> 00:40:04.983 Which I think is really good when it comes to, um\u2026 You know, just normal\u2026 normalizing, like, a conversation between two humans. Like, you don't always\u2026 say the person's name or something, right? So that\u2026 that makes sense.  00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:08.062 A little bit of a sound, because Michael didn't have to ask.  00:40:08.086 --> 00:40:20.086 Use, say, Gemini. Tonight at all, because it makes a little sound. I don't know if you heard the sound, but it's almost like a\u2026 Like, when you turn on a device, you can hear a little sound.  00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:17.979 Yeah.  00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:25.501 Like a whoosh, so to speak, and so he would hear that, and then just go from there.  00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:24.369 Um, okay.  00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:31.330 Right, so you would know that it's on, and, like, you can\u2026 you can talk now, and makes sense.  00:40:31.722 --> 00:40:35.722 Is there anything that you dislike about Gemini, about having Gemini?  00:40:40.092 --> 00:40:46.092 That's the difference between Gemini and A, because A just gives you a blue light.  00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.406 No? Okay. All right.  00:40:46.564 --> 00:40:52.564 Yeah. Yes. Yeah.  00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:50.667 And if you cannot see the blue light, you don't know if it's on or not.  00:40:53.990 --> 00:41:02.990 That's a big difference, that's right. Um, what would you change to Gemini, um, to make it easier to use? Is there anything?  00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:58.058 So that's a big difference between the two.  00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:09.967 Divorce recognition? Well, but it is recognizing your voice.  00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:30.175 Yeah, I think that's\u2026 that's what I think speech and word recognition is pretty good when you're comparing, um, Gemini to A, I guess, because it\u2026 It's definitely doing better, but is there anything that you would change to make it\u2026  00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.073 Speed recognition?  00:41:30.636 --> 00:41:39.636 In any other aspect, like how, um\u2026 It could be anything else, too, and, you know, it doesn't have to be something.  00:41:42.516 --> 00:41:48.516 Speech recognition? Um, we're not sure if Gemini goes through Michael's glasses or not.  00:41:48.762 --> 00:41:53.762 And so, if it doesn't, that would be a definite plus.  00:41:53.750 --> 00:42:00.750 Because remember, made us doing their own AI, so I don't know that it would go through the glasses.  00:42:00.797 --> 00:42:19.797 Yeah, yeah. Because, you know, like, the glasses allow him to\u2026 add things to the\u2026 to A, and, like, you know, for the shopping list and things like that, so those two can be synced, but\u2026 Yeah, I'm not sure. That might be something to look into, um, if those\u2026 if it would\u2026  00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:41.199 Allow Gemini or, you know, some other, like, chat GPT or something, but\u2026 I believe it would not\u2026 Yeah, because you know how Alexa does not allow S, or S does not allow A, like, something\u2026 because those are\u2026 the parallels, like, they are competitors, almost.  00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:20.739 And\u2026  00:42:32.972 --> 00:42:34.972 I agree.  00:42:41.638 --> 00:42:47.638 So I guess that would be\u2026 Yes.  00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:50.210 Classes allow Surrey. But probably because that glass is, no, you need the phone to work.  00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:58.712 Yeah, and I think the glasses might be also okay with, like, a regular Google Assistant.  00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:57.125 Because the glass is paired to the film, so I think that's\u2026  00:42:59.038 --> 00:43:12.038 But not, like, an AI-powered. You know what I mean? Because it has its own AI, but that's interesting. Maybe it's worth checking. Like, I don't know whether, you know, it could just surprise us by having.  00:43:15.502 --> 00:43:22.502 The glasses are paired with the Be My Eyes app. That is their accessibility feature for the blind.  00:43:16.178 --> 00:43:19.178 You know, having the ability to sync.  00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:24.548 Okay. Okay.  00:43:21.978 --> 00:43:26.978 And so that is one thing that they truly are paired with.  00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:42.498 Right, right. Okay, that's\u2026 that's good to know, okay. Alright, so in this training, um, we covered\u2026 four topics. So, we did, um\u2026 news and facts, which is information seeking.  00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:51.938 Um, entertainment, self-care, medical needs. And meal preparation. Um, what topic would you continue to use after this training?  00:43:55.872 --> 00:43:59.872 With, um, with Gemini, especially, and why.  00:44:01.184 --> 00:44:03.184 Meal preparation.  00:44:03.892 --> 00:44:11.892 Because\u2026 I think my parents would be\u2026 Happy if I didn't create a meal preparation.  00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:06.895 Okay. Is there a reason why?  00:44:12.053 --> 00:44:19.053 Yeah, uh, that, for sure, but\u2026 I\u2026 Yes.  00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:22.156 For you personally, forget about us. Entertainment. Go ahead, say it again.  00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:25.269 Entertainment. Okay.  00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:35.296 Um, what specifically in entertainment would you use it for?  00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:43.295 Okay. Um\u2026 Anything new, because you're already doing those things, right? Like, you are playing songs already using your glasses.  00:44:35.698 --> 00:44:37.698 And my favorite songs.  00:44:43.379 --> 00:44:51.379 Is there anything new you would do with, um, with using Gemini, and especially related to entertainment?  00:44:53.887 --> 00:45:04.887 Think about learning, maybe, about\u2026 more about, um\u2026 the different songs, or the different actors, or\u2026 Different movies.  00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:10.848 Yeah. He just said, like, what happened to Hulk Hogan?  00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:12.795 What did you say?  00:45:13.384 --> 00:45:20.384 Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, so that, that makes sense. So, like, you would, you would want to get more information about those.  00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.090 Because, you know, it's all over the news right now.  00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:37.674 You know, those particular\u2026 movies or series related to entertainment, and\u2026 maybe generate, like, synopsis, or\u2026 you know, a little summary of the movie, or a book, or, you know\u2026 Yeah, that would\u2026 that would be great.  00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:43.892 All right, um, so what are your goals\u2026 what were your goals?  00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:51.415 Before we started this training, and have you met them?  00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.260 What was your goal? What was one of your goals? Was it to learn more about Gemini, or\u2026?  00:45:55.302 --> 00:46:02.302 Have you\u2026 do you feel you've met that goal, or\u2026? You think you have?  00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:18.938 We were at the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum. On the weekend. Michael used his glasses a lot there. You know, what am I looking at? You know, you're looking at an Oscar statue by whatever.  00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:08.445 Okay. Yeah.  00:46:15.895 --> 00:46:16.895 Uh-huh.  00:46:16.978 --> 00:46:20.978 Yeah. Mm-hmm.  00:46:19.036 --> 00:46:24.036 Or, you know, the costume that Ryan Seek. Was it\u2026 who was it? Brian Gilligan.  00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:30.179 Ryan, whatever, the guy that wore the pink suit with the diamonds for Barbie?  00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:40.410 I gotta describe that, so he used the glasses a lot for that, to\u2026 what am I looking at? And he was getting information about the different things at the museum.  00:46:34.389 --> 00:46:36.389 Yeah, yeah.  00:46:40.961 --> 00:46:45.961 Yeah, okay. So, that's\u2026 I think the glasses are such a good.  00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:55.550 Tool to have, especially when you're traveling and going places, just to\u2026 get more information, and it's portable enough.  00:46:55.538 --> 00:46:58.538 And you don't have to take your phone out each time.  00:46:58.256 --> 00:47:04.256 To, um, sort of, you know, get, get whatever information you need. So that's perfect.  00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:11.588 Um, so, you've definitely gotten better using AI tools within your class.  00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:21.498 Glasses, and anything else. Um\u2026 that you\u2026  00:47:15.576 --> 00:47:29.576 In the car, on the way back from that museum. We use Gemini to ask a question about, um\u2026 it was something related to the museum. I honestly can't remember what it was.  00:47:25.158 --> 00:47:27.158 Yeah.  00:47:29.332 --> 00:47:34.332 A friend of Michael's was also in the car with us and had asked a question about.  00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:35.158 Yeah.  00:47:34.869 --> 00:47:42.869 One of the shows or things that we saw there. Is it, like, when was the movie, like, Casablanca, or something like that? I can't remember.  00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:47.109 Yeah. Oh.  00:47:42.282 --> 00:47:47.282 What year, so we asked Gemini. That I do remember distinctly.  00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:58.708 Yeah, no, no, but that's great, okay, and, um, did you pick\u2026 Was that your first choice? Like, that you wanted to ask Gemini? And\u2026 okay, alright.  00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.881 I don't remember what movie, for example.  00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:04.560 That's\u2026 Gemini, yeah, okay.  00:48:02.942 --> 00:48:06.942 Gemini, rather than Google it, we just ask Gemini.  00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:09.511 Alright, so, Michael, do you have any suggestions for this training program?  00:48:09.285 --> 00:48:16.285 Ask Gemini what her favorite color is. Michael! So pretty good, guys.  00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:33.046 Anything specific that you have? Like, any suggestions you may have for us, or for the training program, or how it should be, or\u2026 Um, anything differently that we should do.  00:48:21.708 --> 00:48:23.708 Forget the color!  00:48:37.303 --> 00:48:39.303 When is Google gonna let you go?  00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:44.863 When is Google gonna let you leave? Leave what? Good job. Okay.  00:48:46.325 --> 00:48:57.325 I'd say the format that you're doing is very good, and doing the breakout rooms is good, the questions\u2026 the slides that you have, because, um.  00:48:49.294 --> 00:48:50.294 Oh!  00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:05.100 If Michael could see, he would be able to refer back to the slides. I know I was looking at the slides when you would ask your question.  00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.860 Yeah. Okay. Great, okay.  00:49:05.622 --> 00:49:22.622 So I think it's a very good format. And the way that you, um, read it out loud for Michael enables him to participate, so I think\u2026 Yeah, you've made\u2026 You've done the training in a way that, um, maintains Michael's interest.  00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:21.361 For sure.  00:49:22.348 --> 00:49:44.348 Oh, for sure. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's really nice to know. Um, alright, so\u2026 So, do you have any\u2026 questions or feedback about Gemini's responses? Anything\u2026 with the responses that went well, and any challenges that you encounter with the responses that.  00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:54.261 Ever since we started, like, related to Gemini. Um, yeah, any responses that you particularly like, and those went well.  00:49:58.761 --> 00:50:00.761 Versus some things that didn't go well.  00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:04.764 Not that I could think of. I think the responses that were more personable.  00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:06.746 Okay.  00:50:05.438 --> 00:50:09.438 Um, kept Michael's interest, and then he would ask a follow-up question.  00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.920 Yeah, yeah. Back and forth. Mm-hmm.  00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:14.062 Yeah, you could just almost see a conversation going back and forth.  00:50:17.968 --> 00:50:24.968 And if it wasn't as personable, or Gemini wasn't quite understanding what the question was\u2026 Just basically say what?  00:50:29.156 --> 00:50:39.156 Yeah, yeah, that was the good part. Um\u2026 Definitely, like, how\u2026 especially with the sugar content that you just asked, like, you know, I did not know the answer.  00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:33.125 It kind of cut the conversation quickly.  00:50:39.566 --> 00:50:48.566 And it still gave you a good\u2026 follow-up, like, you know, response that, oh, you could check here, like, you know, instead of, like, just giving a vague and incorrect answer.  00:50:48.285 --> 00:50:56.285 Um, so that makes sense. Um, what are some of the challenges that you encountered, um, when asking for responses?  00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:13.010 Speech recognition? I would guess not responding\u2026 quick enough. Like, not ask\u2026 If you weren't quite sure what you were asking.  00:51:13.924 --> 00:51:18.924 And you start talking, and you're not\u2026 and you're trying to come up with the correct answer.  00:51:17.478 --> 00:51:19.478 Mm-hmm.  00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:23.646 Yeah. Okay, okay.  00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:24.776 She loses you. A little bit quicker.  00:51:24.506 --> 00:51:33.506 Be a little bit quicker in terms of responses, okay. Um, anything else that you can think of when it comes to challenges?  00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:40.244 She understands me most of the time, but not all the time.  00:51:40.747 --> 00:51:45.747 Okay. All right, um, can you give me an example?  00:51:45.707 --> 00:51:51.707 Of when she doesn't understand? Yeah.  00:51:48.726 --> 00:51:56.726 When she doesn't? Angie, when you mumble a little bit? You wanna mumble a little bit? She'll be like, what did you say?  00:51:57.611 --> 00:52:03.611 I'll clear my throat and say\u2026 I've said this, that, or the third.  00:52:00.569 --> 00:52:02.569 Yeah. Yeah.  00:52:04.804 --> 00:52:11.804 Okay, all right. That makes sense, okay. Um\u2026 Another\u2026 this is my personal thing, but.  00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:26.059 I think when we first started and we did the\u2026 Participatory design, especially when we were talking about all the responses, Michael. Um, and you know how you asked about the conflict between Israel and Iran.  00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:30.210 And it just sort of gave you, like, so much information at once.  00:52:45.419 --> 00:52:53.419 Oh, hi! Claire, um, are we done with Michael?  00:52:53.220 --> 00:53:01.220 No, we're still on 3.1. Yeah. No, you're good. Are you\u2026 yeah, I don't know.  00:52:55.207 --> 00:53:07.207 Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I mostly just want to say bye to Michael, and then we'll probably let her go, yeah, because we finished early, sorry about that.  00:53:09.155 --> 00:53:27.155 Okay. Um\u2026 Let's see, Rosie, I may just, um, ask you to share with Claire and Peter, um, like, one quick command, and then maybe we don't get enough time to show Michael.  00:53:27.531 --> 00:53:47.531 If you want to show them stuff you work on today as a final, um\u2026 Oh, there, there's Prayal. Hi! Sorry for interrupting, I know you two are still going. Um, Rosie, you wanna say hi before our summer program ends, so I just figured Rosie will show something, and then we'll let you go back to the room again.  00:53:30.662 --> 00:53:32.662 Great, okay.  00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:57.827 Oh, yeah, I was just gonna\u2026 I was using Gemini for, um\u2026 Like, through the health, um, like, personal health, um.  00:53:51.446 --> 00:53:53.446 Yeah, sorry about interrupting.  00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:03.590 Like. Like, things to do to, like.  00:54:03.606 --> 00:54:14.606 Calm yourself down. So it's like, um\u2026 like, calming yourself doing music and going outside, and just like\u2026 she would give me a list of things to do.  00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:25.280 And is doing creative and doing, um\u2026 self-care, and I\u2026 is music soothing? Does I\u2026 Using, um, Gemini to give you these.  00:54:25.057 --> 00:54:42.057 That are problems, so you can find. Find, like, calm, or just being\u2026 in a good state of mind through things like journaling and the aromatherapy, and just\u2026 He's even just petting them, or just listening to music and writing it down so they\u2026  00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:59.779 Do you ever know is a platform I can get all these\u2026 it's just, like, a short list of things, you just care for yourself, like doing exercise, or\u2026 Lucky, she wants you, oh, you can do some aromatherapy and\u2026 Jess, she just gives you a list of things you can back yourself up with, like, self-care.  00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:06.510 Rosie is sharing the list of things that Gemini told her, and she shared her screen.  00:55:06.276 --> 00:55:12.276 Showing the different, um. Suggestions that Jim and I gave her. Okay, that's nice.  00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:18.043 You can do this. Yeah\u2026  00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:21.510 And do you want to read, um, maybe one more thing, one or two things that you may, um.  00:55:16.662 --> 00:55:18.662 Share your screen, Rosie.  00:55:21.098 --> 00:55:26.098 Do this summer, so Michael can know your summer\u2026 rest of your summer plan?  00:55:26.439 --> 00:55:33.439 Oh, like, you know\u2026 Like, like, end of next week, and coming next couple weeks.  00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.680 The U.S. Open of Surfing is in Huntington, and we're using Gemini to, um.  00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:44.447 They find parking and\u2026 They're looking for, um, survey competitions, because.  00:55:44.294 --> 00:55:50.294 We asked her about, like. One will be the longboard surfing, um.  00:55:50.275 --> 00:56:02.275 Contest happened, because I like surfing longboard, because. I was just, like, want to watch that, because I'm not that\u2026 really that great, but I just like watching, so just using Gemini to, like.  00:56:01.967 --> 00:56:09.967 Giving information about things I like to watch, just\u2026 Just to, um, for my own summer plans, yeah.  00:56:14.598 --> 00:56:18.598 Michael, do you have anything you want to tell Rosie before we let her go?  00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.538 Thank you for the information, Rosie.  00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:24.387 Tell her, um, what we asked, um, Gemini when we were in the car, coming back from the beach.  00:56:24.858 --> 00:56:28.858 We asked Gemini to, uh\u2026 We're gonna streamline where we were.  00:56:29.592 --> 00:56:34.592 About the boat in Australia. About the boat in Australia. There's a boat that crashed.  00:56:35.407 --> 00:56:41.407 That crashed on Rainbow Beach. And my boss told us about Rainbow Beach, because he was from Australia.  00:56:44.035 --> 00:56:53.035 And this ship crashed in the 80s, or the 70s. And so Gemini gave an obscure fact that was truthful.  00:56:56.965 --> 00:57:06.965 Oh, no, thanks. Here you go, like, a family connection, but it's like\u2026 kind of is\u2026 I don't know if history's\u2026 feel, you feel it.  00:56:57.079 --> 00:57:01.079 From the 70s, when his father lived in Australia, and\u2026  00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:07.289 Yeah.  00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:14.630 His dad had told him a story, and Michael verified the story with Gemini.  00:57:11.057 --> 00:57:13.057 Some kind of connection, yeah.  00:57:14.004 --> 00:57:31.004 Oh, yeah, using that, it's kind of\u2026 it's like\u2026 This really happened, like\u2026 Okay, is it\u2026 Gemini knows it was there, so\u2026 backing information to what your dad told you, so you\u2026 It was a real thing, so\u2026 used to jeopardize, like, another\u2026  00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:36.125 I think another perspective. For us to, like, use in our life, yeah.  00:57:32.964 --> 00:57:34.964 Yeah.  00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:44.413 Thank you so much for sharing, Michael, and pray I'll let you folks go back into your room.  00:57:40.588 --> 00:57:42.588 Yeah, that's right.  00:57:45.126 --> 00:57:53.126 Yeah, and um, Kaylee and Lori and Orisha and Rosie, you are afraid to go. Have a\u2026 Nice up the summer, we'll stay in touch.  00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:49.756 Okay.  00:57:50.828 --> 00:57:54.828 All right, okay. Okay, bye.  00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:05.597 Thank you, you guys, too.  00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:23.211 Okay, so you want me to take the notes? Okay.  00:58:22.352 --> 00:58:32.352 Um, alright, so, um\u2026 Yeah, sorry, Maureen. I think we were talking about\u2026 Where do we go?  00:58:33.046 --> 00:58:40.046 Yeah, um\u2026 from your perspective, how can we make the AI responses more relevant to you?  00:58:43.045 --> 00:58:50.045 Right, and\u2026 I remember we were just talking about it, and then it went off.  00:58:45.305 --> 00:58:47.305 That's\u2026 that's the question we were discussing.  00:58:54.818 --> 00:58:59.818 I know, I know. Um\u2026  00:58:58.951 --> 00:59:02.951 To make the AI more relevant. Um.  00:59:04.106 --> 00:59:14.106 Well, I think Gemini picks up. Where maybe the glasses lets off, or Alexa likes\u2026 Um, where the different devices.  00:59:04.996 --> 00:59:05.996 Yeah.  00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:25.930 Stop Gemini picks up. And it gives\u2026 And another opportunity, like, if you can't get the answer from your phone on Chess.  00:59:18.419 --> 00:59:20.419 Yeah. Mhm.  00:59:26.831 --> 00:59:40.831 Because from my era, I was new to Google, we would just start Googling everything, and now it's almost as if you don't need to Google anymore, you can just ask Gemini, and you'll get an instant response.  00:59:40.227 --> 00:59:45.227 And for Michael, who grew up with all of the technology.  00:59:45.265 --> 00:59:52.265 It's so easy for him just to ask his glasses, or\u2026 because he's wearing them most times, and he will say.  00:59:52.275 --> 00:59:59.275 Well, I need my glasses to see. And so, because it tells him the information that he needs.  00:59:59.055 --> 01:00:08.055 More so than just asking the phone anymore. If the glasses isn't giving the answer quick enough, he can ask Gemini.  01:00:07.967 --> 01:00:16.967 Yes. Okay, so, like, different tools will give different kind of responses, and there were one\u2026 if one falls short, something.  01:00:17.173 --> 01:00:23.173 There's another platform to pick up and try that for asking that particular question.  01:00:23.352 --> 01:00:35.352 Okay, that makes sense. Um\u2026 All right. Um\u2026 So, any command examples that you can specifically share when it comes to.  01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:44.140 Um, you know, how one\u2026 uh, one platform will let\u2026 let off, and then, you know, some other platform would pick up.  01:00:45.955 --> 01:00:50.955 All I can think of is the calendar. If you ask.  01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.430 Is there a specific example?  01:00:51.138 --> 01:01:02.138 Um, S on the phone. What am I doing today? Or what's\u2026 on my calendar. She might say, oh, you have 3 events today.  01:00:58.177 --> 01:01:04.177 Yeah. Mm-hmm.  01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.200 Yeah.  01:01:02.003 --> 01:01:09.003 And you can say, what are the events? You have 3 events today. Whereas if you ask Alexa.  01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:16.501 She was like, you have 3 events today. At 8 o'clock, you are going to the brain, and at 10 o'clock, you have.  01:01:13.284 --> 01:01:15.284 Uh-huh.  01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:21.365 A dental appointment. It will give\u2026 it will literally read your calendar to you.  01:01:22.009 --> 01:01:28.009 And then the downfall is Gemini won't go into your calendar unless they have access.  01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:27.465 Correct.  01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:46.530 Yeah. Um, can you think of something other way around where\u2026 where AI or Gemini, where\u2026 Um, and the glasses would pick up and, and where Alexa or\u2026 S would not respond to, or not respond appropriately.  01:01:51.523 --> 01:01:54.523 Are there any topics or examples like that?  01:01:56.409 --> 01:02:09.409 Um\u2026 Well, with the glasses, Michael can\u2026 is really good, like, with playing a lot of his music, and then asking questions about the author.  01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:16.224 Who wrote the song, or when did it come out, or\u2026 play something similar to it.  01:02:16.893 --> 01:02:21.893 And it's all linked to his\u2026 to the Apple Music, right? And which is on this phone.  01:02:17.563 --> 01:02:19.563 Yeah.  01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:28.808 Whereas\u2026 the A Alexa is more linked to.  01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:40.892 Amazon Music. Um\u2026 And I would guess, um, we haven't done it, but actually, we kind of did it in a roundabout way.  01:02:34.676 --> 01:02:36.676 Right.  01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:54.283 Asking Gemini about certain things related to that song. You could get it, and especially\u2026 Like, if the song is from a movie, for example, when we were at the museum in Los Angeles last weekend.  01:02:54.328 --> 01:03:06.328 He could have said, what is the theme song from Casablanca? And that type of thing, and he would have gotten that from Gemini, and probably gotten more information from Gemini than from his classes.  01:03:02.876 --> 01:03:04.876 Yeah.  01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:20.381 Got it, okay, okay. All right, makes sense. Um, so we're interested in designing the AI response to be more interactive, um, so\u2026 imagine, like, a virtual clinician.  01:03:20.275 --> 01:03:28.275 Um, for you to, um, help you with your needs. Um, so when this training is not on, um, say you needed.  01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:34.172 You know, any, any, um\u2026 anything that you need, like a virtual clinician for.  01:03:34.297 --> 01:03:39.297 What kinds of help would you like to receive from this kind of agent?  01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:44.830 Well, I think what Michael did tonight, when we were doing those examples with his hair.  01:03:45.206 --> 01:03:51.206 And yeah, it's like, how do I comb my hair? Because that's one thing in EOS, I, have I done my hair properly?  01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:50.662 Yes.  01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:58.128 And he asked that follow-up question, how do I apply the type of hairsty, and then the hair gel.  01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.240 Yeah. No. Mm-hmm.  01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:06.327 That was all very relevant to a 25-year-old. And so, I think that was very appropriate.  01:04:05.238 --> 01:04:07.238 Yeah, yeah.  01:04:06.129 --> 01:04:12.129 Um, I could see the virtual\u2026 I mean, it worked with Gemini doing that, right?  01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.412 Mm-hmm.  01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:18.052 Right, right.  01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:32.434 And, um\u2026 more so, like, stuff like that. Um\u2026 how do I\u2026 I would guess you could even say something like, how do I\u2026 brush my teeth to make sure I clean them all, or, um\u2026  01:04:27.507 --> 01:04:35.507 Yeah, yeah. So, would you say that when it comes to, like, a virtual agent or a virtual clinician, it would be more of.  01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:51.704 Um, providing ideas of what. Kind of questions and what kind of content he could ask for. Um, so that the\u2026 he could use the, um, platforms or the tools to the fullest of its ability.  01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:59.472 I think so, yeah. Um\u2026 Because I think the biggest difference is Michael has a TBI.  01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:12.661 And so\u2026 And me being older, and so I'm having to try to figure it out compared to someone like Peter, for example, who is.  01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:05.573 Yeah.  01:05:12.444 --> 01:05:20.444 Closer in age to Michael, who doesn't have a TBI, I'm sure he just can come up with stuff like this, where, um.  01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:25.048 Right. Yeah. Right.  01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:28.184 Michael's starting to get back to that type of way, whereas for me, it's a whole new learning experience.  01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:41.749 Correct. Correct. Okay, alright, that makes so much sense. Um, thank you for sharing that. Um, okay, so\u2026 Um, what information do you want to share with this kind of virtual agent?  01:05:42.993 --> 01:05:51.993 Or what information do you want the agent to learn, so that it could help you with the homework, or\u2026 like, the training of this training.  01:05:53.136 --> 01:06:00.136 Um, I think the more you use the AI, the more the AI learns about you.  01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:10.060 So, for instance, with Michael's glasses. He can ask a question, like, um\u2026 I'm blonde. Hey, Maida!  01:06:10.544 --> 01:06:13.544 What am I looking at? And Maida will give a description.  01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:21.802 And then Michael can say, remember, Maida, I'm blind, and my Maida will then give a more comprehensive description.  01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:19.588 Mm-hmm.  01:06:21.587 --> 01:06:31.587 As somebody's looking at. And so, the AI responds to that when you say, remember, I'm blind, or I am blind, what am I looking at?  01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:27.888 Yeah.  01:06:31.702 --> 01:06:34.702 Or, I am blind, is it safe to cross the street?  01:06:34.443 --> 01:06:46.443 That's not a good example, because they won't\u2026 no AI will tell you it's safe to cross the street because that's a safety issue. But, um, it might say, are there any cars in my vicinity?  01:06:35.613 --> 01:06:37.613 Yes.  01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:48.625 Yeah. Yes.  01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:54.293 She's fine. Yeah, she's right there, she's okay. She was asking about the dog.  01:06:54.673 --> 01:07:04.673 But I think, um\u2026 Yeah, so no AI will tell you, yes, you can cross the street, but they can tell you, um, if you say, remember, I'm blind.  01:07:04.924 --> 01:07:07.924 What is on the sign above me. It will read the sign.  01:07:07.696 --> 01:07:16.696 Right. Yeah, and it's almost like\u2026 you want to learn your own history and your own, like.  01:07:12.025 --> 01:07:14.025 More detail.  01:07:16.218 --> 01:07:23.218 To remember the facts about. About yourself, and then respond.  01:07:23.016 --> 01:07:34.016 Um, appropriately, you know. Oh, don't worry about it. Oh, I'm almost\u2026 I should be done, um, I guess.  01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:34.139 Yes, definitely. Michael's just throwing the dog up.  01:07:34.526 --> 01:07:42.526 Alright, so\u2026 Alright, what would be, um, ideal interaction between.  01:07:38.276 --> 01:07:40.276 This is a screen I'll open.  01:07:42.457 --> 01:07:48.457 Between Michael and the agent, so a virtual agent like that, who would be helping with.  01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:58.301 You know, maintaining the learnings from this kind of training.  01:07:55.167 --> 01:08:03.167 Well, I noticed that when Michael uses Gemini. He would say things like, um.  01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:09.959 Thank you, and Gemini responds back, you're welcome, that type of thing. And it's more conversational.  01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:17.042 Listen. And, um\u2026 And even with follow-up questions on both ways, whether it's from Michael or from the agent.  01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:15.916 Yes.  01:08:17.195 --> 01:08:22.195 When they were asking about, um. The weather in Africa.  01:08:22.023 --> 01:08:28.023 And Michael said, well, how's about in, you know, Tanzania? He went to the different places, his sister's got.  01:08:22.378 --> 01:08:28.378 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:31.956 And then she\u2026 he said, thank you. She said, you're welcome.  01:08:32.387 --> 01:08:37.387 That makes a difference, I think, because it's just part of a typical conversation.  01:08:35.798 --> 01:08:37.798 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:42.712 Whereas, even with Alexa, he'll say, oh, thank you, Alexa, and there's no response.  01:08:41.403 --> 01:08:43.403 Correct.  01:08:43.254 --> 01:08:50.254 Um, Suri responds back. But\u2026 does Maver respond back to you? Maida doesn't.  01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.256 Yeah.  01:08:49.415 --> 01:08:55.415 Does not. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah.  01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:56.979 Gemini does, and Suri does, but Alexa and the glasses don't say, oh, you're welcome.  01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:07.507 Yeah, and I think, um, the other difference when he was asking about the weather, he\u2026 he asked what's the weather in, um, you know, Tanzania? And then, for the.  01:09:07.574 --> 01:09:24.574 Other two locations, he did not say the whole\u2026 question. It was like, how about in\u2026 you know, Uganda, or how about in Kenya? So, it doesn't even, like, it remembers, like, it contextually remembers what the context was and what he was asking in the.  01:09:24.496 --> 01:09:36.496 Question previously, and then kind of repeats and makes up the context on its own, which, which\u2026 Which is different from how A or S would be, um, in this given situation.  01:09:35.265 --> 01:09:45.265 That's right. And with the person with the TBI. Or\u2026 that's a lot easier, because having to remember a big, long prompt.  01:09:42.827 --> 01:09:44.827 Yeah.  01:09:44.983 --> 01:09:48.983 It's a lot different than being able to have it more like a conversation.  01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:58.320 Yeah. Exactly, yes. All right, well\u2026 That\u2026 that really\u2026 that this is it, actually, yeah. Is there anything else you would like to share with us?  01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:07.045 He's like, I'm done. Can you\u2026 can you just, like, be done now? I'm just so done, right?  01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:15.120 Well, Michael, I just want to say thank you so much for another great summer. You taught us so much about AI.  01:10:11.384 --> 01:10:23.384 Thank you. I feel, yes, the same way. I think, and you've done so well, um, since the past year. I think I see huge, huge, um.  01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:30.393 I mean, I think gains in your skills and your language and your speech, especially, I think it's really wonderful.  01:10:34.968 --> 01:10:54.968 And thanks so much for everything you're doing to support her mom, and we\u2026 cannot do this without you every summer, and we love seeing you all making really great, um, explorations and trying out new things with us, and learning from, um, these new available free tools, and, um, yeah, it's been a great summer.  01:10:35.836 --> 01:10:37.836 What do you say, Michael? Thank you.  01:10:38.962 --> 01:10:39.962 Yeah.  01:10:55.096 --> 01:11:02.096 Um, is there anything, um, like, I'll follow up on the gift card, it got to your email. Um, they'll probably do it in waves.  01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:15.735 Nice. Um, and is there anything else you'd like us to follow up with, or, um, if you're interested in maybe doing more of the lessons in the fall and spring semester, we're planning and thinking about that, because we have a few people on the way.  01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:26.596 Yeah, please keep us in mind, because, um, we're learning a lot from it as well. I mean, truthfully, Alexa has been a godsend for Michael, because it's making him more independent.  01:11:19.824 --> 01:11:21.824 So let's the people that are\u2026  01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:35.325 All of these different technologies and the AI. It is helping Michael become more independent, and it's helping us, kind of.  01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:40.404 Think outside the box as well, and that's been wonderful. So we've truly appreciate.  01:11:44.218 --> 01:11:51.218 Thank you. Michael, we're all done. We'll let you go eat your dinner. Thank you so much for being very patient with us.  01:11:44.807 --> 01:11:47.807 Every time you are offered to us, we really do.  01:11:51.857 --> 01:11:57.857 Thank you so much, we appreciate all your help. Thank you. Bye-bye.  01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:08.890 I go, he's so funny. He's like, I'm funny! Okay, Claire K stopped the recording?  01:12:02.307 --> 01:12:03.307 Aye.   , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  It seems like you've asked for a breakdown of a SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note and its function, structure, and issues of concern. Here's a summary:\n\nFunction: The SOAP note serves as a structured method for healthcare providers to document patient encounters in an organized way, providing a framework for evaluating information, diagnosing, and treating patients effectively.\n\nStructure:\n1. Subjective: This section includes the patient's symptoms, history of present illness (HPI), medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, review of systems (ROS), current medications, and allergies.\n2. Objective: This section documents vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n3. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing problems, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n4. Plan: This section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, therapy needed (medications), specialist referrals, and any other follow-up steps.\n\nIssues of Concern:\n1. Order of information: While the traditional SOAP note follows Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan order, rearranging it to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) may provide quick access to ongoing care information and improve efficiency.\n2. Time integration: The original SOAP model does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap.\n3. Data volume: The shift to electronic documentation has led to the inclusion of large volumes of data, which can burden clinicians if the data are not useful or accurate. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize relevant information for easy access and efficient diagnosis and treatment. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK> To enhance the system prompt and guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in generating a SOAP note, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed and actionable direction. Here's an example of how the prompt could be refined:\n\n\"As a clinician, your task is to generate a comprehensive, well-structured, and easy-to-follow SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note for patient encounters. To achieve this goal, focus on creating an accurate and informative Subjective section detailing the patient's symptoms, medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, review of systems (ROS), current medications, and allergies.\n\nNext, pay close attention to the Objective section by including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data to support healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding treatment plans.\n\nIn the Assessment section, provide clear and detailed information on problems, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem, ensuring a thorough analysis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.\n\nLastly, don't forget to include any necessary additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, therapy needed (medications), specialist referrals, or follow-up steps in the Plan section for a more effective and efficient treatment.\"\n\nBy providing this detailed prompt, the LLM will have a clear understanding of the expectations and focus on areas where it needs improvement to generate accurate and actionable SOAP notes.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  The conversation appears to be about the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation in healthcare. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Introduction: SOAP notes are a structured way for healthcare workers to document patient information, helping guide clinical reasoning and decision-making. The structure includes four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.\n\n2. Subjective: This section includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The CC is the reason for the visit, while the HPI provides context about the patient's symptoms. The HPI can be organized using the acronym OLDCARTS: Onset, Location, Duration, Characterization, Alleviating and Aggravating factors, Radiation, Temporal factor, and Severity.\n\n3. Objective: This section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data. It's important to distinguish between symptoms (subjective) and signs (objective).\n\n4. Assessment: This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\n5. Plan: This section details additional testing, consultant referrals, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed to address the patient's illnesses.\n\n6. Issues of Concern: While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it can be beneficial to rearrange the order for more efficient communication. However, the original order remains important as it provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. A weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time, and extensions like SOAPE have been proposed to address this gap. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK> The system prompt could be revised to provide more specific guidance that encourages the LLM to focus on the structure and organization of the generated SOAP note in relation to the target SOAP note. Here's an example:\n\n\"Generate a response discussing the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note format and its importance as a clinical communication tool. Compare the generated SOAP note with the provided target SOAP note and provide feedback on how to improve the structure and organization of the generated SOAP note for more effective communication between clinicians.\"\n\nBy focusing on comparing the generated SOAP note with the target SOAP note, the LLM is prompted to analyze the discrepancies in structure and organization between the two notes. This approach encourages the LLM to provide actionable feedback that helps improve the variable of interest (SOAP note structure). Additionally, asking for a comparison between the generated and target SOAP notes implies an expectation of specificity and accuracy, which should help the LLM generate more detailed and informative responses.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

How are you doing, Speaker 3?\n00:00:11 Speaker 3\nI'm doing well because today around half day I went over to my community pool with my dad and we did some treading water and like no water. I'm trying to get back into the pool but like just, you know, it's good for me to be in the water. So. I'm happy because of that. \n00:00:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's really great.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nSo Speaker 6 will be coming in a little bit, so we're going to get started without her. Let me just. Pull up. What I need OK. If you're still trying to fix your computer, I can still give you a minute or I can start. Just let me know when you'r ready.\n00:01:08 Speaker 3\nMaybe you can just start or I can like. Stop video and see what happens, and this is the same so they can move. It's that laptop cameras not working OK. But I can just still listen to you.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 5 is that is that going to be fine? OK. Perfect. OK. Umm, so we were gonna try to look at what we did last week. So last week we were going through and doing playing music or looking at the videos. So I was going to see if you could show me how to play a music or video from your Speaker 7.\n00:02:00 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, I'm Speaker 7. I I just asked her to like go on YouTube and like, play a song and she just. I just do it that way. Just ask for the YouTube video and she plays it when I just say play this.\n00:02:08 Speaker 1\nYeah. So let's see. So last week you were trying to pull up the Olympic ceremonies. I know it was having a difficult time. Did you want to try to pull that up again? Or try something different.\n00:02:40 Speaker 3\nMaybe I'll try to play some music or something.\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:02:45 Speaker 3\nOK, just ask her, OK? Speaker 7. Can you play Banning CA on YouTube.\n00:02:57 Speaker 7\nWhat you need to?\n00:03:13 Speaker 1\nIt's just still searching?\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's playing right now. Like the YouTube is trying to show you on my phone, but. Just playing the song.\n00:03:23 Speaker 1\nSo I can't. I can't hear it, but I last week we worked on turning the volume up and the volume down. Could you try doing that this time?\n00:03:31 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. OK. Speaker 7, can you turn the volume down? Speaker 7, can you turn the sound up?\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n00:03:56 Speaker 3\nCan you stop the video? So it's in there somewhere. I stopped it. Yeah.\n00:04:05 Speaker 1\nOK, great. I think that was easier than last week too.\n00:04:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, because like you know, I've done it most of the times last week. You know, it's indoor rain somewhere, so I can just do it again.\n00:04:22 Speaker 1\nHave you been working on it throughout the week?\n00:04:26 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, like this. I think it was Tuesday we were playing. Like it it like UM. We're listening. I was asking them Speaker 7 to play another song and this it's like I wanted to listen to it and she pulled it up and it's like. Something to getting used to doing.\n00:04:50 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. That's super and that's super useful.\n00:04:54 Speaker 3\nYeah, I know it's new thing is getting part of my routine and saying make her play song and do.\n00:05:05 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Have you have you set it up to the playlist that you made?\n00:05:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, I just ask Speaker 7 like to go on YouTube and like for an artist and just like it just kind of plays some one night for each other. So I'm just, I just go by artist. Yeah.\n00:05:28 Speaker 1\nOK. Great. Today we're going to be talking about self-care needs. So I wanted to find out what type of self-care or health related activity. Do you have difficulties managing?\n00:05:54 Speaker 3\nWell. Trying to think, well, like selfcare is like when they, like tried to. Like she like, want, like, want to look good in the mirror and look at my do my hair and stuff sometimes. Like ohh. My left arm is kind of weaker at this point in our recovery, so my hair up in a ponytail or headband or something. It's like sometimes it's kind of a struggle to get into place.\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:06:27\nYeah.\n00:06:30 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that can? Be a little bit difficult.\n00:06:37 Speaker 3\nWell, I put a lot of lotion on my skin cause I like being in the pool and chlorine eats her skin, so I put it on a lot and so sometimes like I want to put a lot of lotion on and sometimes it gets like your clothes kind of get too lotiony. It's too much on your it's kind of like on your shirt and stuff like. Too much so. So you have to find it in the middle, like too much or too little.\n00:07:11 Speaker 1\nIs it because you squeeze out too much?\n00:07:14 Speaker 3\nI squeeze out too much and then I go there, put this on my face.\n00:07:19 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. And then you have a lot.\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nOf extra. Yeah. So like, I'll put it back in a plastic bag.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nOK. Anything else that self-care related?\n00:07:39 Speaker 3\nI'm well, I'm trying to. Cut down my process. Food in my diet, to where like my eat more like natural food than fruits and grains, and my diet. Not eating like processed food or fast food or like like frozen meals I'm kind of. And make my diet more healthy, so it's good for my overall health. I'm trying to cut those out of my diet.\n00:08:09 Speaker 1\nOK. And and maybe maybe with the food, do you have any technologies or tools? That can help you manage these needs.\n00:08:24 Speaker 3\nWell, I can. Like. Tell my smartphone to. Like. Read me my my shopping list or then say say it to me out loud and so say if I want to go to the grocery store, I want to get that. Not that. So are you gonna get this this this. So it's like in my mind it backs up and ohh I need to shop for this. Then that one too. So I sometimes use that like I need to make a little list in my phone.\n00:09:03 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Like, I mean, yeah, really useful.\n00:09:07 Speaker 3\nI know. Yeah, I like listening everything cause like my background is in science and protocols are all this usually step by step by step.\n00:09:19 Speaker 1\nDo you typically when you're making the list? UM. Do you? Like is it on your computer or? What do you what do you make? Your list on.\n00:09:35 Speaker 3\nOh, on my like my iPhone, there's a little UM notes app, so like if I'm in my in the store I have my phone with me all the time. I don't have a little. I usually get a piece of paper and write it by hand. But if I have it on my phone, out in public, I can just look at it. But. Trying and I can just hold in my hand and look at that. I need to go down the aisle and. Get some milk or something.\n00:10:00 Speaker 1\nAll right, that's great. And then I was wondering, Speaker 3, when you were talking about squeezing out the lotion. Sometimes it squeezes too much. Is that due to weakness? In your arm.\n00:10:14 Speaker 3\nI think it's a combination of. Like weak arm and also how much pressure I can. I'm supposed to use or. I think it's either too much or too little. It's like just. To like round it out, see like. I think it only did like a little squeeze or that I squeeze it too hard. It's like all of it out.\n00:10:37 Speaker 1\nDo you use one hand or two hands?\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nI always use my left hand, it's dominant, but I probably need to use both to too. So in my head I think it's just one hand and I actually need to use 2.\n00:10:52 Speaker 1\nOK. I mean that makes sense. Sometimes I like to use one hand because it seems convenient, but.\n00:10:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, and that's not what I'm supposed to do.\n00:11:03 Speaker 1\nOK. But that's that's good. And that's the way that you can help manage in the future? UM. OK, let's see. So I have something, but I don't know if you take, do you take medications? You don't have to tell me what or any.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nOhh I take medication regularly. I have a little pill case in my bathroom I take I have daily doses to take, yeah.\n00:11:33 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to think of. 10 scenarios to complete this the sentence, so I want to learn to manage my medications. Or slash take care of myself more about. Let's see. So I read the question kind of funny. OK, so I want to learn how to manage my medications or take care of myself more about.\n00:12:28 Speaker 6\nHi. Sorry I'm. I'm so sorry I'm late. I've been commuting to Rancho every single day so. But. Where's Speaker 3?\n00:12:40 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm actually having some camera issues, but I'm here.\n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nOK. Hi, Speaker 3. \n00:12:44 Speaker 3\nHi, Speaker 6. \n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nHello.\n00:12:51 Speaker 1\nWe were just going to try and work on coming up with some sentences about managing our medication or self-care. So is there anything that you want to maybe have to learn to manage medications or anything that you think would help?\n00:13:21 Speaker 3\nWell. I I say I take daily medication for my. I have like dose. I got regular dosage ofpills for like anti seizure meds and  I just need to take them twice daily so maybe I need to put like alarms on my phone for the times it's supposed to go and like oh, I know that that's for that.\n00:13:50 Speaker 1\nOK, so alarms you said two times a day.\n00:13:52 Speaker 3\nYeah, I take one early morning, one late night. Yeah. So I have twice a day pills for anti seizure.\n00:14:00 Speaker 1\nOK. So doing an alarm.\n00:14:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, alarm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nAll right. And then. Are there other things for managing that? There's other aspects besides medication that you think for self-care that maybe you can have something, maybe Speaker 7 help manage?\n00:14:36 Speaker 3\nMaybe like I have like well alarms would be like you know I have physical therapy appointments or speech sessions like maybe I'll ask her to. Like makes me have like. A. A reminder like 30 minutes before or something cause like my PD clinic is like like a couple streets away from my house. So I need to like the little time to get ready.\n00:15:04\nYes.\n00:15:07 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. And then maybe if we're trying to come up with something for uh. Like maybe another thing to help with like if you have your medications for taking besides like just an alarm for time, we could have it set up something about the dosage instructions or potential side effects.\n00:15:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, I could just maybe ask her to do a reminder of like, UM. Check the like when we check the side of the bottle or something like that. So like they have a little medicine like like little fact sheet about what this is for. Yeah. Maybe like right, maybe about like 20 minutes before. I'm just taking this look, look at the side of the bottle or something like that.\n00:16:12 Speaker 1\nDo you is do you always take the same amount of the same medication?\n00:16:18 Speaker 3\nCurrently, but my neurologist, he said in like a week or two he's gonna, like, face out one and switch it with another. So I need to. I'm in like transition right now. So I'm it's like in the next couple weeks I'm going to like switch one out and get a new one.\n00:16:41 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.  So for that one, will the dosage change?\n00:16:48 Speaker 3\nWell, the dosages would change like one postman faced out and then one is building up this new one is. So this is will be going up.\n00:16:57 Speaker 1\nOK. Are you going to take it the same amount of times a day?\n00:17:02 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's both twice a day, but they're on the new pill is higher now and the I'm phasing out the old one that was on SO1 going up, one going down.\n00:17:16 Speaker 1\nAll right, so we could set up something that will because it's going to be a new dosage, maybe to remind you about what dosage to take possibly.\n00:17:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good reminder.\n00:17:33 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that you that could help you manage the medication or manage you know, other aspects of self-care? That we talked about.\n00:17:49 Speaker 3\nWell, I think that those are my 2. Issues in self-care right now, like with this weakness, weakness and like on my left side. But I wanna try to do my hair or put it in a ponytail or back behind my face like I'm trying to do it evenly. But this left side. Not always there. And then taking my daily medication, then sticking to this like the doses aren't supposed to be on right now. And also I'm I'm supposed to be doing daily stretches for my PT clinic to make my body open up. So I think they need to get reminders for that too.\n00:18:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, yeah, that would be great.\n00:18:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because I have a little packet. They gave me a little like, oh, do this one do this one they like. I'm supposed to actually do them. Speaker 7 reminds me of it. OK, you. Need to do it.\n00:18:51 Speaker 1\nSorry, I froze for a second, so I wasn't sure what happened. Go ahead, sorry.\n00:19:12 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's like it was. It was breathing for me. Breaking up for me a little bit. These are great. I just want to make sure we also ask. Sorry, I sorry, I missed the beginning. Have we asked Speaker 3 the goals yet or what her goal is or? Oh, we have, OK.\n00:19:36 Speaker 1\nWhat her goal is?\n00:19:38 Speaker 6\nSo. Yes, so we can. So, Speaker 3, what is your goal with Speaker 7? What do you hope to use Speaker 7 for?\n00:19:51 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm well. Currently I'm trying to do. I have my cell phone having alarms and daily planned activities like, you know, go to the USC election meeting it makes like a little noise and I need to have my Speaker 7 like back her up too or something. Ohh, go to your like tomorrow over at Chapman has Irvine campus. I live in Irvine so I go to PT over there, so about like. 45 minutes before. I just need to go get dressed, so maybe I can have Speaker 7 give me reminders and I'll I'll do this then.\n00:20:32 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:20:34 Speaker 3\nSo I just like how, UM, the Alex. I'm trying to use here right now. It's like I have my alarms and my reminders on my phone but need to have when you have two things telling you what to do is easier.\n00:20:49 Speaker 6\nYes, I think Speaker 7 is a great tool for you, especially when you're at home and it gives you that extra reminder to, you know, tie your hair or check. Yeah. Check. You know, 30 minutes before you have your PT session remind you to get ready. Like, oh, it's time to get ready. Yeah. OK.\n00:21:11 Speaker 3\nI need to get ready and leave. Yeah, because like you know, PT or a different album, there's like a speech that we can wear jeans and a top PD and wear your leggings and your hair in the back and the bun. And like, like fitness shoes. It's like it's different.\n00:21:29 Speaker 6\nTrue, right? OK reminders or?\n00:21:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because my different appointments are different. You need to look different ways.\n00:21:46 Speaker 6\nThat's right. All right. Everything looks great, so I wonder if the other. Groups are done. But yeah, how are how are both your weeks so far?\n00:22:08 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm happy because. Feels like, you know, actual summer like. Kind of hot, but I like it.\n00:22:16 Speaker 6\nYeah, me too. I love the hot, the warm weather. What about you, Speaker 1?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's been great. It does feel like summer's coming to me because. Yeah. Yeah.

That's awesome so. Yeah. Is. Yeah. Speaker 16 is in this in this uh and uh. OK. Yeah. So you're graduating and same same class as me, I guess so, yeah, that's also. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And then Speaker 3, how have you been? Kind of how have your therapy sessions been going?\n00:23:41 Speaker 3\nWell. I do a lot of therapy sessions because I live in Irvine and Chapman University has a Irvine campus for like biotech and like also like nursing school and like speech, SRP's like speech, language and so like I go there for a lot of things and. Well, they're on summer break right with summer session. So it's and like working on my socializing with them like, you know, they're my peers. So I'm just trying to make make my summer like progress towards like socializing with, like, people my own age, like in the future when I return to lab work, like, I'll be around people my own age, so that's my goal right now.\n00:24:23 Speaker 6\nWell, that's awesome. I love that, good goals to work towards. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go back to the main room so we can learn some more skills about medication, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:25:23 Speaker 4\nAlright, if thank everyone's back, I'm going to share my screen again and we're going to practice a couple and then we'll go back into our breakout rooms. OK so. It's going to be a two-part command, but first we're going to use our Lexa to create a medication list for the sake of practicing as a group. We can do like a over the counter medication like by Advil or Tylenol as practice. So does anyone want to go first?\n00:26:09 Speaker 8\nWell, I can do it. Speaker 13. Give me a. Tell. Naproxen. Pill.\n00:26:25 Speaker 13\nAre you trying to shop for Naproxen pill?\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nYes.\n00:26:32 Speaker 13\nOne moment. Showing results from Naproxen Pill. The first one is Amazon Basic care back and muscle pain. Naproxen Sodium tablets, 220 milligrams, 90 count.\n00:26:50 Speaker 8\nOK, they. She wants me to pick up that naproxen pill, so that's good. I I can. Maybe I didn't. Tell our ask. Properly. I'll do it again.\n00:27:17 Speaker 4\nAnd Speaker 8, the there is an example on the right here. So say the wake up word and then create my medication list and then you could use that medication name you just mentioned.\n00:27:30 Speaker 8\nOK. Speaker 7. Create my. Medication list. And I want it. On. Not.\n00:27:46 Speaker 7\nCreate a list called medication right?\n00:27:51 Speaker 4\nIt picked up. Yep, he dropped it, picked up the first command. So we created the list. So now as a follow up you could add that name.\n00:27:51 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 7.\n00:28:01 Speaker 13\nRight.\n00:28:02 Speaker 8\nRight. Give me an aspirin. How's that?\n00:28:09 Speaker 13\nI've created medication list. What would you like to add to it?\n00:28:14 Speaker 8\nAspirin.\n00:28:17 Speaker 13\nI've added aspirin to your medication list. What else?\n00:28:26 Speaker 8\nCough drops.\n00:28:30 Speaker 13\nI've added cough drops to your medication list. What else?\n00:28:35 Speaker 8\nThat'll be enough.\n00:28:38 Speaker 13\nOK.\n00:28:40 Speaker 4\nGreat job, Speaker 8. Yeah, that was awesome. So it will ask those follow up questions just like that. And then how you responded when you added those specific examples? It's a great job, OK. Does anyone want to go next in creating their medication list?\n00:28:59 Speaker 2\nI will go. Speaker 14, create my medication list. Compounded hormones. Heart medication. Supplements. Sleep. I have all these medication profiles. Compounded hormones. R DHEA. Thyroid. Progesterone, estrogen cream, testosterone cream.\n00:29:43 Speaker 4\nDid did it pick up? The command did anything come up on the screen when you said that? OK, so how about first let's try that again. Let's first create that medication list.\n00:29:53 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, create my medication list.\n00:30:06 Speaker 14\nCreate a list called medication, right? Yes. I've created medication list. What would you like to add to it?\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nCompounded hormones DHEA.\n00:30:19 Speaker 14\nI've added compounder hormones to your medication list.

It has the same screen.\n00:31:18 Speaker 4\nYou could try that again. Say the wake up wake word and then say I'm all done. Maybe see if that.\n00:31:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, all done now.\n00:31:29 Speaker 14\nI'm not sure.\n00:31:32 Speaker 4\nOr how about?\n00:31:33 Speaker 2\nAll done now. Creating medication. Lists. Speaker 14's all done now.\n00:31:47 Speaker 14\nSorry, I'm not sure.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:31:51 Speaker 4\nOK, say the wake wake word again. Say go home.\n00:31:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, go home. It the screen turned off.\n00:32:06 Speaker 4\nDid it turn off? Yes. OK, so it's back. Do you see the main display again now? Yes, OK. Perfect. Great job.\n00:32:15 Speaker 2\nDigging Go home Command, I'm using most often.\n00:32:24 Speaker 4\nGreat job. OK, who wants to practice this next?  Go ahead. Yep, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:32:39 Speaker 9\nLet's see, Speaker 10. I'm gonna you have to 1st unmute. There you go. Go.\n00:32:46 Speaker 10\nHey, Speaker 15.

So I think we'll now go back into our breakout rooms and then practice setting reminders and kind of like as a review from the first week reminders to take certain medications and then other self-care practice. OK. So yes, so well. Let me open or doctor, can you open that? Yes, thank you.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:45 Speaker 3\nHi, Speaker 1.

Speaker 1, I can share my I can share the screen and then do you want to go ahead and? Should we go through the commands? So let me share my screen real quick. Oh.\n00:40:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, because I have the slides cause I.\n00:40:30 Speaker 6\nYou have the slides. Do you mind sharing? Can you share them? Because I don't have permission at the moment. Or I can ask Speaker 5.\n00:40:42 Speaker 1\nIt's saying that I can.\n00:40:45 Speaker 6\nOhh share screen OK. Yes you can.

Yeah, because I'm disabled too.\n00:40:58 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, if you're sending reminders, that's one of the things that you mentioned earlier, Speaker 3.\n00:41:09 Speaker 3\nThat to make it ohh I need this need to be ready for this in like 45 minutes or something to like flash on my screen. I'll need to get ready for PT or something.\n00:41:25 Speaker 6\nYes. Should we try that? Speaker 3, do you want to try that right now and set a a, maybe a reminder. So let's do. Do you want to do 30 minutes before your PT session?\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right, so. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder for 12:00 PM tomorrow for PT in an half hour?\n00:41:53 Speaker 7\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:41:56 Speaker 3\n12:00 PM.\n00:41:59 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at noon.\n00:42:04 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nAlright, I did it. Yeah, it says.\n00:42:09 Speaker 4\nNice.\n00:42:12 Speaker 3\nFriday, August 2nd at noon. So I have to get ready for. PC at that time.\n00:42:19 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:42:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:42:23 Speaker 6\nYeah. So the PT session starts at 12:30.\n00:42:26 Speaker 3\nWell, it's they want me there around like. So it actually starts at 12:45, but it's nice like they give myself 1/2 an hour to get ready and the only out of the door by 12:30. So like.\n00:42:39 Speaker 6\nOh. Ohh good.\n00:42:41 Speaker 3\nWhenever the you know the clinicians have to be there on time at to meet them at the door. So say I need a little time.\n00:42:48 Speaker 6\nYeah, good. I love how you already strategized and kind of gave yourself enough time to get ready and yeah, you.\n00:42:57 Speaker 3\nIt's good for me to plan. I need time for that. Customers like. Well PT like. You have to. Well, I try to look presentable because it's PT you wear, like your sweats and like, not really that attractive but like. I want to look like. You know, athleisure, it's like kind of like trendy workout plans, but but that is because they, they know that a team of clinicians are my peers. So I want to look fashionable in my own head.\n00:43:30 Speaker 6\nOhh yeah. Well, that's always. Yeah. I mean it's always, I mean you feel better too if you kind of like, yeah, absolutely.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's confidence. Yeah, I'm going to do this and like, I need half an hour to get ready.\n00:43:45 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know. Women, we need our time to get ready.\n00:43:51 Speaker 3\nIf you need your time and like you know, I have to put my hair up in a ponytail. That. Looks. No straight line behind my head because like you know, sometimes those PT clinicians comes and just put you on your back on the pad. It's like you wanna hang your hair out of the way?\n00:44:07 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. Speaker 3, I can see you already thinking about. Everything and you, you have all your outfits for different therapy sessions. I like that you're very organized. You're very.\n00:44:18 Speaker 3\nI'm really organized. I'm I'm a scientist, so I can think everything has to be. It's categorizing. Everything has a box to stick it.\n00:44:27 Speaker 6\nI love that. OK. All right. Let's go back to our slide. All right. I think we are on this one. OK. All right. Go ahead, Speaker 1, we can kind.\n00:44:44 Speaker 1\nOK, sure. So kind of like the the alarm you just set, this one's going to be specific for the medication like the medication you mentioned for that you take for seizures, yeah. So you can try that command. They wrote it up here and you can try it with that medication.\n00:45:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Speaker 7. Remind me to take Keppra at 7:00 AM.\n00:45:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that was good. That was like my morning dose. Yeah, it's on there, it says.\n00:45:35 Speaker 1\nOK, good. And you can do the same thing?\n00:45:38 Speaker 3\nFor the night dose, yeah. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder? For taking my my nightly medicine Keppra at 7:00 PM. 7:00 PM.\n00:46:03 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 7:00 PM.\n00:46:09 Speaker 3\nWell, it seems like she has both. Of them now.\n00:46:12 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great.\n00:46:15 Speaker 3\nYeah. If I say if I string it like word by word, she had to follow it like that.\n00:46:22 Speaker 1\nThat's OK. Yeah. Sometimes the way we say it, she'll she'll want us to say it in a specific way, but that's good. So now you two alarm set for every day.\n00:46:34 Speaker 3\nYeah, every day. Yeah.\n00:46:37 Speaker 1\nOK, great.\n00:46:38 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:43 Speaker 6\nShould we move on to the next one? Let's try this one.\n00:46:53 Speaker 1\nOK, so this one when we you need to find an over the counter medication so you can if you're trying to look for a specific medication, you can ask Speaker 7 where to find that medication so. What medication would you want to find?\n00:47:16 Speaker 3\nProbably would like to find like Tylenol like pain reliever like. Maybe I\u2019ll just command her.\n00:47:25 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:47:25 Speaker 3\nOh, OK, Speaker 7. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:47:34 Speaker 7\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy, who is 6 miles away on campus Drive and 1:50 right in. .7 miles away on Culver Drive, Urban Medical Center pharmacy 6.3 miles away on 7th Ave. St. 101 you can ask me for things like what's the address for the first one?\n00:48:04 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options where I can buy it.\n00:48:09 Speaker 6\nNice, I know. And she even read you the addresses.\n00:48:12 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's like, well, I've gone to that one before. It's like right down the street from my house.\n00:48:17 Speaker 6\nOh, good. She's pretty accurate, right? Yeah.\n00:48:21 Speaker 3\nI like how she's like spot on because like, my brain is analytical like that. So I can I like how she sticks to it.\n00:48:30 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK, great. Well, yeah that I think that's really helpful that way. You know if you know that you can't have to go to a close one, then she tells you how far it. Is so then you can the one that. It's close.\n00:48:50 Speaker 3\nOr like sometimes I go to like. I mean, I'm going to like a session now, I guess like my PT clinic is on the right and that one right there is on the route just to get it on the way or something like that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that would be super, super helpful.\n00:49:07 Speaker 3\nYou know, because like, well sometimes like. They make me work at PT, so maybe on the way back I need to get. Some Tylenol.\n00:49:18 Speaker 6\nNice.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nSo, Speaker 3, do you do your laundry?\n00:49:24 Speaker 3\nI do, but I I just took time. I've been right now I don't have a lot right now, but sometimes like, well, I have a little bin. If it's full, I can do one little. But it's only about like half full right now, so. I usually when my bin is full, I can stick it in. It's like 1 load per bin so.\n00:49:46 Speaker 1\nOK. Do you just wait till it gets full or do you do it? You know, once a week or once a month or.\n00:49:55 Speaker 3\nI usually rely on my bin like cause it's a size about like one load and usually I have. It's just like I usually label everything is like color like colors and cotton cause like it washes everything even though something so like. Different kinds of fabric. When you wash it all together, I have like a dyed a towel with a cut, cut, cut color in it. I have white underwear. They get dyed.\n00:50:30 Speaker 1\nSo do you read it?\n00:50:32 Speaker 3\nYes, and I use separate and then also I do my sheets once a month like the sheets in my bed. So I have to do that load by itself like with like a hot wash like hot temperature because like. It's cotton and it it kills like stuff on my bed and needs to get it. Clean.\n00:50:54 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, that's great. OK. So this one, the first step is how to do laundry. So I know you do your own laundry, but we can ask Speaker 7 and see how Speaker 7 says to do laundry.\n00:51:09 Speaker 3\nOK, I\u2019ll try. OK Speaker 7. How do I do my laundry? She gave me a couple. Then you click on or maybe select number one.\n00:51:32 Speaker 4\nThanks.\n00:51:37 Speaker 3\nOK, so Speaker 7 select number 1.\n00:51:44 Speaker 7\nFrom nearly dark 18. To give stretch things out of white clothing, use a one to one ratio of dish soap, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, and enough water to soak. A shallow bucket works well. Once the item is soaked for 30 minutes, washer is usually when you're ready to do laundry, zip it and tossing the load.\n00:52:11 Speaker 3\nWell, she just read to me about how to. Wash UM sweat stains out of UM like white clothing and using like a a combo of baking soda and and soap and hydrogen peroxide. Different like ratios and you say? Ohh stick it in.\n00:52:32 Speaker 1\nThat's really helpful.\n00:52:33 Speaker 3\nYou know, it's like, well, it's really I liked how it's really different like you know, when you have a scientific procedure different like it's like different parts of it like you have got the whole like procedures, then you have the the beginning, this and this and this it is scientific.\n00:52:59 Speaker 6\nI love that. It's all, it's all like analogy, right? They're all analogy, yeah.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nOK, so I was thinking that we could try to set a reminder for to do it at a specific time because you do your sheets once a month. Maybe you can have Speaker 7. You can pick a date and then just have Speaker 7 tell you on that date.\n00:53:30 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:53:33 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7. Can you set a reminder for me to do my laundry on August 15th?\n00:53:43 Speaker 7\nWhat time should I remind you?\n00:53:49 Speaker 3\n8:00 AM.\n00:53:51 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for August 15th at 8:00 AM.\n00:53:57 Speaker 3\nWell, she just made a reminder for me, she said. 8:00 AM on August. August 15th, halfway through the month, and. I have no appointments during that early morning time.\n00:54:13 Speaker 1\nOh, perfect.\n00:54:14 Speaker 3\nIt worked for my schedule.\n00:54:18 Speaker 1\nThat's great.\n00:54:22 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 3, on the Speaker 7 screen, does it say laundry as the name of the reminder or? Maybe you can ask Speaker 7 to. Show you your reminders. Alright? Yeah.\n00:54:43 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7, can you show me my reminders?\n00:54:55 Speaker 6\nDo you? Do you see one that says laundry on August 15th, or it's just a blank?\n00:55:00 Speaker 3\nIt's no, it's there's a bunch of them, so it says on August 15th. Do my laundry 8:00 AM and then. And. So every Thursday at like 520 prepare for Trojan space and then. Friday. Tomorrow it says. Half an hour PT, so it's 12:00 PM. Half an hour. That's like a reminder and then. I have my dosage. For taking my meds in the morning and night time, so I think there's about. Looks like there's about six things in the reminder list for me now. So I'm happy.\n00:56:00 Speaker 6\nThat's awesome. And you did them all. Yeah, I think you.\n00:56:05 Speaker 3\nWe may have a step by step. It's easier for me to think that way.\n00:56:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, you set them all up very nicely. Very good. OK, next one.\n00:56:18 Speaker 1\nOK, so we can do the stains out. You kind of did that one when you asked how they did the laundry, she kind of told you how to get. The stains out. Maybe we can try the one about fabric softener.\n00:56:40 Speaker 3\nUhm, OK, I'll try the command, OK. Hey. Speaker 7. When do I use fabric softener?\n00:56:59 Speaker 7\nEvery cycle, but it is usually recommended to use it every few washes.\n00:57:06 Speaker 3\nWow, she just told me that. It's used in every cycle or. Can we rotate it like recommended every two or? Every, every other wash and. Every like and as needed. So to add your fabric softener thing. It's like kind of your own choice you do you need it or you can just let it go.\n00:57:31 Speaker 1\nOh, OK. Do you use fabric softener?\n00:57:41 Speaker 3\nYes, if like the item we're trying to wash. Can be kind of like like stretched out. So I need to make it. So some things need to be a little crisp anywhere.\n00:57:57 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Let's try the next one. OK, so this one. So if your head's really hurting and you have a headache or a migraine. We can try to ask Speaker 7 how to how do we would treat that.\n00:58:20 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK, cool. Speaker 7, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:58:29 Speaker 7\nThere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for migraine food applying ice packs to the back of the head with temple taking and not taking a warm shower or bath inside, drinking water resting, and with physical therapy.\n00:58:52 Speaker 3\nOhh, she just read off things to do. You have migraine symptoms and different techniques you can do like put ice on the back of your neck or go to PT clinic and. Like soothe yourself.\n00:59:09 Speaker 1\nDo you ever get migraines?\n00:59:12 Speaker 3\nI actually do not get migraines.\n00:59:15 Speaker 1\nOK, good.\n00:59:17 Speaker 3\nBut some people do. It's like a lot of people.\n00:59:21 Speaker 1\nYeah, those are good ways to help if you if you do get migraines. But even if you get a headache they might help.\n00:59:26 Speaker 3\nYeah, like it's good to like. Like sometimes you just want to like, listen to some chill music and just. Check out.\n00:59:39 Speaker 5\nYeah, that could help too.\n00:59:41 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like when they're doing a lot of other things with my day, sometimes you have to take a break.\n00:59:50 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's really helpful. OK. Should we try another one? OK, this one's for stomach pains, OK.\n00:59:58 Speaker 3\nI'll try, OK. Speaker 7. What do I take for stomach pains?\n01:00:08 Speaker 7\nI don't know that one.\n01:00:12 Speaker 3\nHe just said. I don't know that one.\n01:00:20 Speaker 1\nWell, let's see. So what? What is something we could take for stomach pain? There's medicine like.\n01:00:31 Speaker 3\nLike anti acid or something like that like so everyone has different pains.\n01:00:38 Speaker 1\nI think wasn't there when you put on your medication list.\n01:00:41 Speaker 3\nOhh, like Tylenol? Like a pain med.\n01:00:45 Speaker 7\nInteractive adventures with character.\n01:00:47 Speaker 1\nOr Pepto bismol.\n01:00:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, Pepto bismol.\n01:00:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, that I think might have been on that list too. So we could read the list off of like medications that you would take. Help remember.\n01:01:06 Speaker 3\nYeah. Speaker 7, can you read me my medication list?\n01:01:19 Speaker 7\nI don't know.\n01:01:21 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just read it to me. Pepto Bismol and Tylenol.\n01:01:29 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.\n01:01:31 Speaker 3\nShe she read it.\n01:01:34 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Should we try one more?\n01:01:41 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n01:01:43 Speaker 1\nOK, so for this one it says finding a specific healthcare provider, so we could probably tell Speaker 7 what kind of doctor give a like, what kind of doctor would you want to find?\n01:01:56 Speaker 3\nI'm probably a good dentist, so you specific Doctor. OK, I command her OK. Speaker 7. Find me a dentist.\n01:02:13 Speaker 7\nFound a few options for them. It was Spring Hills Dentistry 5.6 miles away on Newport, Dr. Irving Children's Dentistry 2.7 miles away on Culver, Dr. E University Park Dental 4.1 miles away on university.\n01:02:35 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options for different choices for dental care in my area. Even though I think my dentist is farther farther away but it's just good to read those options to.\n01:02:49 Speaker 1\nYeah. And I think if you asked her again, she could like to find more. She could umm, search, search for more. Yeah. Or if you, I think search for your dentist. She could probably tell you where that is too.\n01:03:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. We will try to ask. Speaker 7. Can you? Look for Irvine dental.\n01:03:20 Speaker 7\nFound in Irvine Dental. Irvine Dental was 4.8 miles away.\n01:03:25 Speaker 3\nI just found it.\n01:03:29 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just wrote me the address and. It just said it's currently closed because it actually stops at six and it says, well, it gave me the address and the suite where it's at so. I go there sometimes, like every couple months, so if I need to like check up or. I have a cavity. I don't like that, but it sends you to get it pulled. \n01:03:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense. Well, that's great. And next time you go, maybe you can use Speaker 7 to help with the address and have the address\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like, well, when my mom drives somewhere, I can just plug it into her like. She puts her little. Map thing and Google Maps and just type in the address and go.\n01:04:22 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's great.\n01:04:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n01:04:37 Speaker 6\nThose are all the commands. And Speaker 3, you did them with 100% accuracy, so that was great.\n01:04:43 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n01:04:51 Speaker 6\nOK, I think we are good to go back to the main room. OK, OK.\n01:05:02 Speaker 5\nOK, I'm going to stop the breaker room. Good job. Nice work, Speaker 3. I really feel like you can utilize this on top of everything that you've been using.\n01:05:13 Speaker 3\nI have my phone alarms and now have my Speaker 7 back it up, yeah.\n01:05:19 Speaker 5\nFeel free to pick your preferred ones because we don't want you to fully cover and drop what you've been doing. OK? Yeah, just pick what's easy for you.\n01:05:21 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:05:34 Speaker 5\nHi everyone.\n01:05:42 Speaker 5\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will. Be oh, I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slides a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So I expect another homework for this week on self-care information. Just just to double check, did you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two? You got all the slides. I know, Speaker 8. You got it, Speaker 10. You got it. OK, Speaker 2, you got it too.\n01:06:21 Speaker 8\nYep.\n01:06:25 Speaker 2\nCan I ask you a question?

Laura, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our PowerPoint train. OK, so after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be any time, but if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd the. So think week six if you go by numbers in your head. Week six, we would like to hear from you just. We will ask you some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well. You can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share together because. Chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel feel free to bring them as well. And I will send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n01:08:17 Speaker 8\nOK.\n01:08:18 Speaker 7\nAny questions?\n01:08:20 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8, we were in the middle of changing his wake up word.

OK, stop.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK> To further refine the system prompt and help the language model provide a more informative and educational response, we could emphasize the importance of structuring patient information in a SOAP note and its role as a crucial tool for clinicians. This can be achieved by expanding on the benefits of using a well-organized SOAP note:\n\n1. Enhance Clinical Decision Making: A well-structured SOAP note allows healthcare providers to quickly access relevant information about a patient's medical history, symptoms, physical examination findings, and tests results. This makes it easier for clinicians to make informed decisions about diagnosis, treatment plans, and referrals, ultimately improving the quality of care for patients.\n\n2. Facilitate Collaboration: A clear and organized SOAP note enables other healthcare professionals, such as specialists or consultants, to easily understand a patient's medical history and current status. This facilitates seamless collaboration between clinicians, ensuring that all relevant information is shared accurately and efficiently, ultimately benefiting the patient.\n\n3. Improve Learning Opportunities: A well-documented SOAP note serves as an essential educational resource for medical students, residents, and other healthcare professionals. It provides a detailed account of a patient's presentation, diagnostic process, treatment plan, and follow-up care, offering valuable insights into the practice of medicine and promoting ongoing learning and professional development.\n\n4. Promote Efficiency: By organizing information in a SOAP note, clinicians can quickly find relevant data during their busy schedules, reducing the time spent searching for information and improving overall efficiency. This ensures that patients receive timely and effective care while minimizing delays or oversights in diagnosis or treatment.\n\nBy emphasizing these benefits of using a well-structured SOAP note, the system prompt can help guide the language model to provide a more informative and educational response that highlights the importance of organizing patient information effectively. This will ultimately improve the quality and usefulness of the SOAP notes for both clinicians and patients alike.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion.

(Debrief) 7-24-2025.m4a   RT, Speaker 2  Transcript  00:00:06 Speaker 1  So our first topic was information seeking and we discussed whether To Do List adding events to a calendar looking at local and international news sporting events. Seeking. And just seeking any information that we're curious about. And so let's find 2 activities related to this topic and practice in putting it to Gemini. And then stop sharing and then I'll have you take over R and go ahead and share your screen. Are you able to flip your Gemini?  00:00:56 Speaker 2  I'm trying to load it, but I think it's like showing like. UM. It's like not letting my e-mail not use it. So it says service not allowed.  00:01:09 Speaker 3  My bank to Gmail to.  00:01:11 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's in my personal e-mail. Yeah, need to. Tenses. OK. Can you guys see it says Hello, R, on there.  00:01:53 Speaker 1  I cannot. Maybe can you stop sharing and reshare? Maybe it needs to?  00:02:01 Speaker 2  Alright. Hello.  00:02:15 Speaker 1  Now yes. Alright, so for information seeking topic, is there a topic of interest you'd like to ask Gemini?  00:02:28 Speaker 2  Yes, they. The middle of summer. So like. Well, you know, I live in South Orange County, so we're like the US open is surfing is coming up. So like, let's see like when I know, I know that's always Huntington Beach main beach. But I don't know what time when.  00:02:46 Speaker 1  Oh yeah, that\u2019s a great question to ask Gemini.  00:02:51 Speaker 2  Because. So it's it's it's fun to people watch.  00:02:57 Speaker 1  I'm actually thinking about going.  00:02:59 Speaker 2  Yeah, so I was. Just walking up and down main and. Just like these people. Ohh no, she kicked the Huntington, then the 22nd through. August Spaghetti in August.  00:03:42 Speaker 1  Is there anything? Is there any more information you would like to know about the US Open?  00:03:47 Speaker 2  Yeah, because there's like this coming week to like 2 weeks. So what? Maybe I can answer. More facts about this. Here she has. Is what I feel like.  00:04:53 Speaker 1  OK, so it gives you the dates for. The long board components.  00:04:57 Speaker 2  Like I like, you know, some people like those little carvers like longboards, fun to ride is. I'm not. I'm not really a big surfer, but just like finding cruising. Yeah, like to see that, you know, main beach honey, she has his son has a tourist trap. But just watching be fun.  00:05:17 Speaker 1  Is there any important information that you'd like to know before going to see the longboards? Maybe something that Jim and I didn't say?  00:05:26 Speaker 2  They're really nice. Like location, actual location. It's just honey beach. So like Main Beach is a long place, like where you know, it's like they ask like what? What side of the pier or something like location.  00:05:42 Speaker 1  Yeah, or where to park or something?  00:05:44 Speaker 2  And where to park, Well, like it's giving a lot, this is just, you know, just type them into like my apple maps or something and pull into like, the main beach parking promenade is easy to get through and some of them like. One street over. We gotta pay for him. So it's. Like. Whenever you drive down there, see well, people go down and sneak around backside. So it's like good to have these suggestions to go through.  00:07:01 Speaker 1  Yeah, for sure. I feel like this is all really helpful that we could like. Put in our Apple maps.  00:07:11 Speaker 2  Yeah, I'm going to park there sometimes like. So maybe like Ohh park around that corner like 1 you walk, walk over one night, walk over to the beach or. No, there's a good steak fish Taco place down the aisle. You just sneak over.  00:07:29 Speaker 1  And that's another thing you could ask too, right?  00:07:35 Speaker 2 Yes.  00:07:36 Speaker 1  I know they only have a lot of vendors, right?  00:07:38 Speaker 2  They did have better for like the main pier antenna stalls up. You know, the Main Street, they got all those like little restaurants and they got parts out front carts out front. It's like sometimes, like when you sometimes surfing is early in the morning, you get a burrito one hand.  00:08:33 Speaker 1  Yeah, the best thing is in the morning.  00:08:36 Speaker 2  Yeah, like those people down here at the wage Newport, they're up. Daybreak. I'm just like. Going to bed.  00:08:49 Speaker 1  All right. Shock. 00:08:55 Speaker 2  Yeah, it's yeah, serious.  00:08:57 Speaker 1  You want to Scroll down and see what else.  00:09:00 Speaker 2  And sandy?  00:09:02 Speaker 1  Sandies.  00:09:06 Speaker 2  Water table. Water table is more a little high end. But it's it's good if you're with a group of. People that want it.  00:09:24 Speaker 1  Pacific hideaway.  00:09:26 Speaker 2  I think. Actually these are main off Main beach. So right there when you go that way, you see the right your left brake on the wave and you go there Scooter, scooter over the house coffee house so it's like. So.  00:09:46 Speaker 1  602.  00:09:47 Speaker 2  Except here. It's not. That was last time I went to 602. It just got like little raps. How much gonna walk right over?To the boardwalk and just like. It's good, like, you know, some nice and honey. Then when they have like the like, the farmers market out front on the main 602 walk right over memory.  00:10:12 Speaker 1  Yeah, and still check. Grab and go. You can like bring. It to the sand.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  I just remember I just. I've gone over to Huntington, down to the Woodies and it's good. Like. We have like a. BLT and just go watch ways good. It's good like thinking about later this summer.  00:10:38 Speaker 1  Yeah. These are great options. I think you can definitely save this chat for summer day.  00:10:44 Speaker 2  Yeah, this outfit.  00:10:45 Speaker 1  Whenever you want to go. Through the long boarding competitions.  00:10:48 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:10:49 Speaker 1  OK, we can move on to the next topic we discussed over the training. So the next thing we did was entertainment to get information related to media, listening to music, watching movies. Maybe even have Gemini generate stories or tell jokes or create trivia games. Is there a topic in entertainment that you would like to ask tonight?  00:11:21 Speaker 2  You know, like, you know, sarcasm people like like, it's funny or something fall flat, but sometimes like. After my injury, I take it straight. Serious but like even the one of my things before my injury, I knew sarcasm like that. So if you wait, I can ask her about. They sometimes people, maybe Gemini and I would have a good one, but like sarcasm jokes here one day and it worked out.  00:11:50 Speaker 1  Yeah, that'd be that'd be good for entertainment and.  00:11:53 Speaker 2  Like you know, entering the conversation, you're just just throw joke at people you know or just like. What is that?  00:12:02 Speaker 1  Yeah, I think that's a great topic to see what Gemini says.  00:12:06 Speaker 2  Ask her.  00:12:07 Speaker 1  Yeah. That one's good.  00:12:48 Speaker 2  Here's the funny. Why did this have her break up with the ocean cause like people like break up as a relationship? Because he was feeling like he was just going through the motions like he had like a relationship like the other person is. I'm just going through the motions. It's funny.  00:13:12 Speaker 1  Do you wanna? Ask for more jokes. Maybe even ask like, do you want them about surfing? Or you can pick a topic as well.  00:13:20 Speaker 2  Him on the topic because we were just talking about surfing earlier, so.  00:13:24 Speaker 1  Yeah, that's it. Perfect. You can maybe use that on Saturday.  00:14:01 Speaker 2  Because this weekend I'm going bowling with like a group of people. So like our cousin. Stop playing cards.  00:14:08 Speaker 1  That's fine.  00:14:14 Speaker 2  Because they heard the strikes were ragged.  00:14:21 Speaker 1  It's a busy weekend, bowling and surfing.  00:14:24 Speaker 2  I just like, well, I'm just watching surfing. They're like, well, I think that we're gonna probably go to. To see the longboarding next weekend, but this weekend I have the serving date so I just.So it's because the strikes were rigged. Trying to make it think about it.  00:14:47 Speaker 1  You know, me too, I'm. I know that the born straight.  00:14:50 Speaker 2  Stroke, he says. I can hit him all, but strikes rate.  00:14:55 Speaker 1  But I don't know much about cards. I wonder if there's a connection there somewhere.  00:14:59 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah, I know basic card games. So this is like kind of in between for me.  00:15:07 Speaker 1  Maybe you could ask Gemini to explain the joke. I wonder what Gemini would say. Oh, I get it.  00:15:45 Speaker 2  There's strike like they do a strike.  00:15:50 Speaker 1  I I told her that went over my head.  00:15:53 Speaker 2  You mean on my head right now? So he asked her.  00:15:57 Speaker 1  OK, I get it. Well, at least Gemini and. I provided a really good explanation.  00:16:02 Speaker 2  You know, ask her why I like using her as like exchange the point like that. Like if I told that girl over there like said, she'd probably be like, get her busy. Hey. Explaining.  00:16:22 Speaker 1  I think that's a good. Saves. I know that you were telling me earlier that like, sometimes sarcasm is challenging for you to understand. Maybe if someone did say something. Like I can't. Talk like sarcastic or not like maybe. You can like. It's like ask Gemini. Can you explain this and then maybe? Why would people to provide like a more in depth explanation? That's funny. I totally that went over my head. I was like, I don't. I don't get it. I'm not laughing.  00:16:51 Speaker 2  You know, like, so these people like some people. Staying is how like it's trained on normal joke. Sometimes those go over your head too, but I can just like it's fun to everything but sarcasm. It's good to get back into.  00:17:07 Speaker 1  Yeah, definitely. Sometimes I don't understand. Sarcasm, I'm like. Are you are you being mean, are you? Like, are you being serious or like that? It's really hard to tell.  00:17:18 Speaker 2  It's like. So this is delivery like you sometimes right there. So you got a chip on your shoulder, that's sarcasm or if you just saying it straight on. Then that's you have been realized realistic with it. But see how you deliver it like you could shrug your shoulders. Of the like weird look at your face out there trying to take you out.  00:17:43 Speaker 1  Yeah. So looking at body.  00:17:47 Speaker 2  Cute, yeah.  00:17:48 Speaker 1  Body movements or Felix questions can kind of help you understand if it's sarcasm, but it's like Gemini. Honestly understand sarcasm. So you're very confused. You can ask them.  00:17:58 Speaker 2  He does.  00:18:01 Speaker 1  All right. And let's go to our next topic. That was self-care and medical needs, so. I know you're really good about taking your medication because you have your pill box, but maybe we can search for. Self keratin.  00:18:24 Speaker 2  OK.  00:18:26 Speaker 1  Or ways to improve our mental or physical health. What sounds most helpful or useful to you?  00:18:34 Speaker 2  Like self-care, like mental and physical health, just like mindset thing. Just.  00:18:41 Speaker 1  Remember, last time we did yoga?  00:18:42 Speaker 2  Yeah, yoga was going on that maybe there's something else you can pick.  00:18:46 Speaker 1  Yeah, maybe there's something else, that Gemma I can provide. Yeah. OK, so some breathing.  00:20:04 Speaker 2  You. Techniques. Yeah, I need to like actually implement the. I've heard about them and. I actually do them.  00:20:11 Speaker 1  Yeah, these are good. I like box breathing.  00:20:15 Speaker 2  Up there, up there, yeah.  00:20:18 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:20:20 Speaker 2  Count to 4.  00:20:24 Speaker 1  That one works really. Well, yeah.Mindfulness and meditation.  00:20:42 Speaker 2  Yeah. And like some of this. Well made neuro. Psych tells me about, like, living in the present and like. Even now not then or where you are, so it's like and also doing the full body scan like how you're carrying yourself and like eye contact. To. Judge yourself. The mirror is supposed to be. Your best friend, not like. You know good.  00:21:14 Speaker 1  Physical activity.  00:21:18 Speaker 2  Kind of like basic exercises and well, just, you know, being outdoors in the environment, just like nature, sounds, sounds and like peaceful. Like, you know, I love watching surfing and going to the beach and stuff, you know, walking on sand. It's always like just your nature. Like, the the breezes and like. I just like being outside, so just walking on the beach.Is always fun.  00:21:41 Speaker 1  Me too. That's one of my favorite self-care activities.  00:21:45 Speaker 2  Eating.  00:21:52 Speaker 1  And what's #4? Engage your senses and creativity.  00:21:57 Speaker 2  And also, just an animal snuck in there, like almost ready. Like I love it. So people bring their dogs to the beach. But like some dogs.  00:22:00 Speaker 1  Yeah, put an animal. Otherwise. Sounds, maybe you can set them. On the beach.  00:22:10 Speaker 2  Are not friendly. Some dogs hang out with their master only, but some really they come and sniff over to your brother nose right in your lap. But it's. Like. They're like humans. Social or not, saying this is like. Aromatherapy what smells is good, like sometimes name sense, like camomile, lavender, stitch just really soothing, but something he smells something else like. They got a cup of coffee like ohh I need to work. It's like sit there but they really fills your mind. Tell what you want to do. Like relax or go to work. Therapies. Good to check into, yeah.  00:23:03 Speaker 1  And then the fifth one, adjusting habits and mindset.  00:23:10 Speaker 2  Oh yeah, somebody's just for overall life screen time. Like I'm talking to you guys, but.After.  Off because like a bunch of their generation on the phone. Streamed TikTok. Ohh, you know, a lot of these therapies. And like talking to people, FaceTime or like talking you guys on zoom and stuff, a lot of interaction is digital. So it's like, oh, I think that we're probably getting used to this. All this is saying blue light to your eye or whatever. Yeah. Like this is kind of bad for your brain, but. Did it come back and it?  00:23:51 Speaker 1  I know that's why I wear my glasses so much more than wearing contacts because they have blue light in them because I'm always on my computer, I feel like.  00:23:56 Speaker 2  Oh. Probably, And also like having mentioned here. Diet, sleep. Those are important for your brain and overall health like. Get my. No, no, I take 9 hours of sleep, but I got a regular basis and my I'm ready to go and also eat my 3 meals and. Different mindset, yeah.  00:24:27 Speaker 1  Yeah, definitely. And.I think that it may be time to go back to the main room. I think we're ending our breakout rooms, is that correct? Doctor, you're heading back.  00:24:36 Speaker 2  OK.  00:24:42 Speaker 3  I was thinking if you're done, would you like to just directly go into individual feedback since we're in the room right now? Has some some questions we can go through. And since R, we don't have your mom with you. We'll just ask you, your individual feedback about. Yeah. Are you OK with that?  00:25:06 Speaker 2  Uh, yes, I can actually tell her to come in. But.  00:25:08 Speaker 3  OK. Maybe we'll do your portion first and then we'll come back. That sounds good.  00:25:14 Speaker 5  OK, I think I'm going to jump in and start on the questions. R with the feedback so first of all, thank you so much for participating. It was just great to be working with you. And I I really like the way you. I don't know made that made the AI experience personal for yourself. So was it easy or difficult for you to use your AI? Why don't you give us a one to five scale? You know where one is super easy and five is super difficult.  00:25:36 Speaker 2  Yeah. Well, maybe it's not a two because like I started with Gemini, she's kind of giving me some vague answers. You know, uh, well, it was Alexa kind of hit or miss. But Gemini is more good amount of detail, but Alexa is kind of. Rod is good for something. It's like shopping list. Wake up and like give her my, like tell me. Oh, I got PT in 45 minutes. She'll give. Remind me of stuff like that. But Shannon is more deeper answers. So I like the difference between those two.  00:26:32 Speaker 5  OK, so it sounds. Like. They are different for they're. Good for different reasons that.OK. And it was fairly easy for you to learn how?  00:26:39 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah.  00:26:42 Speaker 5  To use it.  00:26:45 Speaker 2  And yes cause. A big portion of our our life right now is getting digital. So it's like need to get with it.  00:26:53 Speaker 5  OK, what specific problems did you have with Jim and I, for instance, specific problems with like vocabulary. Did I understand your questions? Does she understand your? I'll call is she. Does she understand language? Was it? And if you did have problems, was it easy? To fix the problems.  00:27:14 Speaker 2  I think it was easy to fix like when I gave follow up questions about like you're talking about the the surf contest earlier where well about like the long board at the open and just like she probably in her little computer brain. I just asked about that. So she knows how to refer back to it.   , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  The provided text discusses the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note, which is a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them.\n\nThe text describes each heading of a SOAP note:\n\n1. Subjective - This section includes the patient's personal views or feelings about their health status, as well as the context for the Assessment and Plan. It includes the Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI).\n\n2. Objective - This section documents the objective data from the patient encounter, such as vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, and other diagnostic data.\n\n3. Assessment - This section synthesizes subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis, listing the problem, differential diagnoses, and the plan for each problem.\n\n4. Plan - This section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses, including therapy needed (medications), specialist referral(s) or consults, and patient education and counseling.\n\nThe text also mentions issues of concern, such as the order in which a medical note is written and the ability to document changes over time. It also discusses the clinical significance of SOAP notes in today's electronic documentation environment. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK> The prompt for the language model could be refined to better guide its reasoning strategy by providing a more specific focus on the objective of generating accurate and informative medical documentation in the form of a SOAP note. Here's an example of how it can be improved:\n\n\"As a clinician, you are responsible for creating detailed and structured SOAP notes that accurately document patient encounters during training sessions. The more succinct yet thorough your SOAP notes are, the easier they will be for other healthcare providers to follow and understand the patient's condition and treatment plan.\"\n\nBy explicitly stating the goal of generating accurate SOAP notes, the language model is encouraged to prioritize this objective in its responses. Additionally, providing examples or context about the type of training session or the specific patient being discussed can help create a more engaging narrative that better reflects real-world scenarios, making it easier for users to understand and learn from the generated SOAP note. Finally, offering constructive feedback on the language model's performance will help foster a positive and productive relationship between the user and the model.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and.

And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about.

Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  In response to your request for a SOAP note on the topic \"Ensuring the structure and style of the provided text follows the rubric for a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note\", I have provided an example SOAP note below:\n\nTitle: Ensuring the Structure and Style of Text Follows the Rubric for a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) Note\n\nSubjective\nChief Complaint (CC): Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI): The text does not follow the required structure and style of a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nHistory: No pertinent past medical history is mentioned.\nReview of Systems (ROS): Not applicable as no symptoms or conditions have been reported.\nCurrent Medications, Allergies: Not applicable as no medications or allergies have been documented.\n\nObjective\nVital signs: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPhysical exam findings: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nLaboratory data: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nImaging results: Not applicable as they are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nRecognition and review of documentation of other clinicians: The text does not demonstrate adherence to the SOAP note structure, indicating a lack of collaboration and shared understanding among healthcare providers.\n\nAssessment\nProblem: Lack of adherence to SOAP note structure and style, leading to inefficiency in healthcare documentation.\nDifferential Diagnosis: It is unclear if there are other underlying issues contributing to the lack of adherence to the SOAP note structure and style.\nDiscussion: The text demonstrates a lack of understanding or adherence to the required structure and style for a SOAP note, making it difficult to quickly understand the patient's status and the assessment and plan for their care.\n\nPlan\nTesting needed: Educational interventions to teach proper documentation techniques in accordance with the SOAP note rubric.\nTherapy needed (medications): Not applicable as medications are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults: Not applicable as specialists are not relevant to the issue at hand.\nPatient education, counseling: Provide educational materials on the importance and benefits of using a SOAP note structure, along with training on proper documentation techniques.\n\nThe text provided does not follow the required structure and style for a SOAP note, leading to confusion and inefficiency in healthcare documentation.

Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better?

This document will detail the components of a SOAP note and its significance in clinical practice.\n\nFunction\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThis section documents the subjective experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient. It provides context for the Assessment and Plan sections. Key components include:\n- Chief Complaint (CC): The patient's reported symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or statement describing why they are presenting.\n- History of Present Illness (HPI): A detailed account of the patient's CC, organized using the OLDCARTS acronym.\n- Medical history: Current or past medical conditions relevant to the case.\n- Surgical history: Important surgeries and their details.\n- Family history: Pertinent family medical history.\n- Social History: Information about the patient's home environment, education, employment, eating habits, activities, drug use, sexuality, and suicide/depression risk.\n- Review of Systems (ROS): A system-based list of questions to uncover symptoms not mentioned by the patient.\n\nObjective\nThis section documents objective data from the patient encounter. It includes:\n- Vital signs: Temperature, pulse, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels.\n- Physical exam findings: Details about the patient's general appearance, specific body systems examination, and any abnormalities found.\n- Laboratory data: Test results related to the case.\n- Imaging results: Results from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or other imaging tests.\n- Other diagnostic data: Any additional test results relevant to the case.\n\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes:\n- Problem list: A prioritized list of problems or diagnoses.\n- Differential Diagnosis: A list of potential diagnoses, ranked by likelihood.\n- Discussion: Explanation of the thought process behind the differential diagnosis.\n\nPlan\nThis section outlines the steps to address the patient's illnesses, including:\n- Testing needed and rationale for each test.\n- Therapy or medications prescribed.\n- Specialist referrals or consultations required.\n- Patient education and counseling needs.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe SOAP note serves as an essential tool in organizing patient information, aiding clinical reasoning, and improving communication between healthcare providers. The note's structure helps ensure that important information is not overlooked and makes it easier for colleagues to understand the case and follow the treatment plan. However, the SOAP note does have limitations, such as its inability to document changes over time, which could be addressed through extensions like the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation). </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK> To improve the system prompt and guide the Language Model's (LLM) reasoning strategy for accurate responses, consider providing a more detailed context and explanation of the adapted SOAP note format in this non-medical context. This could include:\n\n1. Mentioning that the SOAP note is traditionally used in healthcare settings to document patient symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and progress.\n2. Explaining that in this specific scenario, the SOAP note structure is being used as a tool for documenting and assessing progress during an assistive technology training session, with some modifications.\n3. Clearly stating the adapted SOAP note's structure:\n   - Subjective: The introduction provides context and a brief overview of the training session plan (P section).\n   - Objective: The VAT Sessions sections document the user's performance on specific tasks.\n   - Assessment: The 3rd and 4th sections evaluate the user's response to user needs assessment and performance during the VAT sessions.\n   - Plan: The final paragraph outlines homework assignments, metacognitive strategies, and future session plans.\n4. Suggesting that the SOAPE model (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Evaluation) could also be used in this non-medical context to address the limitations of the adapted SOAP note format:\n   - Explain that the SOAPE model adds an additional \"Evaluation\" section to document changes over time.\n   - Discuss how this extension could be beneficial for tracking the user's progress and adapting the training program accordingly.\n\nBy providing a more detailed explanation of the adapted SOAP note format, the LLM will have a better understanding of the context and structure, allowing it to generate responses that are more accurate and closely align with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance.

(News & Facts) 7-10-2025.m4a    Speaker 1: RT  Speaker 2: Clinician  Speaker 3: Clinician  Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  So I'm just. For my like my like state of mind, summertime is like keep on going.  00:00:13 Speaker 3  Can you all hear me? OK, I want to make sure my Wi-Fi is also stable. I don't know what happened. Has a little glitch. Perfect. I'm going to share the slides here and then R, just double checking. Did you start creating a free Google Gemini account yet?  00:00:37 Speaker 1  I think I did, but I don't think it's. I probably. I don't think I actually finished it, but I'll do it later or something.  00:00:43 Speaker 3  OK. Why don't you go open your browser and then go through Google Gemini so we can get this ready and what we can do is I'm going to go through some content. And you can try to explore some of this information on Google using the Gemini AI and for the rest of you all you are more than welcome to try it together, because one thing we'll learn about assisted technology or AI assisted. Tools for therapy is we all need to learn some basic competency about how to use this so. R, even though we're kind of like teaching you and working with you to help you, we're also learning this ourselves.  00:01:30 Speaker 1  OK.  00:01:31 Speaker 3  If you remember, we learned about news and facts and communication using Alexa last summer. Do you remember? What are some of your popular comments? Like you are doing and using with Alexa on this topic.  00:01:46 Speaker 1  Uh. I was like, you know, I'd say alarm wake up or I put a reminder in like I got PT top of the hour. So it's like I usually it's like another alarm clock.  00:02:00 Speaker 3  Yeah, from what I'm hearing, it seems like you're doing a lot of these for a reminder and scheduling so news and are very different. Let me show you some examples. OK, so these are the things you are curious about, for example. Two weeks ago we did a design session or like R, if you were to go to AI tools and a website that tells you about everything you want to know, what would you like to do? And I believe you worked on something like like research and chemistry like you looked up. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about that?  00:02:40 Speaker 1  And I was trying to. Ask like I think it was Jim and I are like one of them. I was like, can you can you like tell me tell me about like specific instrument in the laboratory like different parts of. I think I think it was like a thermocycler, like a machine that like, makes different temperatures for like PCR machine. It's like temperature for like every action to happen. And if I if I hear the steps one more time before I start like a procedure at my volunteer lab position and through my Alexi, I wake up and hear it before. So when I go over to laugh and say ohh I can remember it so I can do it right there. So it just gives a little review before start of my day.  00:03:33 Speaker 3  Yeah. So it sounds like before you start your day, you wanted to kind of have like a assistant to her. With key things to remember, steps to follow. So this is something AI is really good at. And then like I know those of you who are in the call, if you log on Gemini, you want to take a look at some of these commands. We're going to all explore this together. OK. So some of the things. It could be like what you're saying, like the weather, because you need to get ready to head to work the calendar events, the dates and destinations and new reports, news reports like about what's going on. Out there, these are mostly done previously on your Alexa, so the reason why this summer both you and Michael picked to use Gemini is that's another AI tools that you 2 feel the quality of the content is pretty good. Thing is you can't take this. On Gemini a. On your phone and you can use this outside your home. What I think it's also helpful is you are a pretty heavy Google user. So what you've been doing like your Google Calendar, like looking up information syncing. So I'd like you to play with some of that. OK and. Know that some of these AI tools may not have the most up-to-date information. So when you think about asking the AI you wanted to come up with some. Time sensitive prompts or information, so to speak, so you can ask Lexa. Ask Gemini just the right amount of information so just some ideas so let's maybe try something that oopsie. Let's try to think about one thing you're curious about, OK? What is something you wanted to know? More information. Like you can think about just along the line of, like going to work or other things.  00:05:43 Speaker 1  Maybe like there could be like a current like news event that like wanted to like learn some back information like I just looked the other day. There's like a big like flooding event in Texas. And I was like, I'll check that out but like maybe it's for like. In my like to talk to me about in the morning to update me about like current events.  00:06:06 Speaker 3  Yeah. So there are some current events that may happen like you wish to stay on top of the news and facts and information, right? One is related to weather, but it's also natural disaster and then? In we I know in it didn't really like happen here in California, but few months ago early in the January, we had mountain fires down here in Los Angeles. So we sometimes just love to stay on top of this information and it's critical for not only just staying top of news. Also critical for safety purposes. Let's get clarified.  00:06:47 Speaker 1  You know, safety if there's fire. Like we're going off the freeway up to like, like the the valley up in LA. Like if there's a fire, some of those freeways, like the 210 or something like shut off. There's like, how do I do that?  00:07:04 Speaker 3  Yeah. So we don't know how much information Gemini has. That's up to date. We're going to explore that together, OK. And if you want, we can even compare the answers about the same question on prompt from Alexa and also look at the Gemini AI's response and see how well they perform. So let's stay with that topic about. There is a natural disaster. Flooding happening in Texas. Yes. So knowing that, sorry, I think I went backward. Whoopsie. If we want to know about these pieces of information, how we do this previously was we go online or if you subscribe to like a new source, it could be an app on your phone like there's a news feed. You get notifications sometimes or you watch the TV, or you listen to the radio station on the car. So there's some possible channels you can find those information. So with this type of design and information, you need to think about what you're going to ask so you can think about specific query or like a long question prompt to ask the AI or Alexa. So let's practice. How would you ask Alexa about this specific information? I don't know if you have Alexa on if you want to bring it and then like put it next to your face so we can see. Do you want to try to ask Alexa about this particular event and see what you can get?  00:08:40 Speaker 1  Alright so. Trying to think of. Where are you? What are we? Ask her so. Trying to say like. How I format my question? Alexa. What about the what is happening in Texas and the floods?  00:09:48 Alexa  This morning. 6 fittings after the damage still tough to fathom. They can. It feels hard. I just talked everything in my mind and I say I want. To help while the death toll continues to rise, Braxton Garments High School, confirming the rising sophomore, died in the catastrophic flooding. His sister Felicity still missing while the family of eight-year old Mary Kate Jacoby says she's entered the gates of Heaven, calling her tiny but mighty. And full of love. The recent numbers reported break my heart. And they break the fart. Briefing officials now facing tough questions on why flood warnings from the National Weather Service were communicated more widely. This incident will be reviewed. You have my word records from a Kern County meeting in 2016 showing former commissioner said the flood warning. Mr. was pretty antiquated, calling it marginal at the best. What's the biggest reason that these systems have not gone into place? At this point, you know. And UM. I was in an office during those discussions, and frankly, I'm more focused on the future in the past. Meanwhile, the grim search for the missing entering another tough day. It's a hostile environment, is what we call it. Everything is moved and shifted, disaster specialist Larry Minor and his team, including horses and search dogs. Working round the clock determined to provide greeted families some kind of resolution. Stay until we get it done and we want them back up here. And those search. Crews tell me their work is really just beginning as they navigate these remote stretches of the Guadalupe River. In the meantime, city leaders here in Carville, Tammy, they are heartened by these special session called for by Texas Governor Greg Abbott. I'm on some of some of the key topics that are planning to be discussed. The emergency communication systems, those warning sirens that could go off whenever rivers. River levels rise during a flash flood as well as much needed relief funding for this entire area. All right, Morgan, thank you. And a reminder, if you're looking for ways to support the flood victims in Texas, you can find them on our website, today.com.    00:12:13 Speaker 3  So, R, since we can't see your screen and it seems like you watched a little video. Oh, you're pausing, Alexa? Yeah.  00:12:27 Speaker 1  She is what she gave me a little video update like like like Natural Disaster over in Texas. And it was like, good to be up to date on that information. It was someone. You know, ask me about my opinion or brings it up. I have some more back info because I just asked her. About it, yeah.  00:12:47 Speaker 3  It's great. So can you quickly summarize what the news information tell you and if you were to maybe like share this again back to Michael because he may be interested in what news and facts you explored, how would you quickly summarize what was going on so he can?Also look up. On his system.  00:13:11 Speaker 1  I just learned that. In like I remember this, one of the counties over in Texas, that massive flooding from the out of the Guadalupe River and all these. Residents were looking for the families and a lot of people disappeared and people were on horses and like surveillance dogs in the whole region like. Like a really a lot of people are devastated. That's why I learned about.  00:13:44 Speaker 3  That's a great summary. R, would you be interested in seeing what a web-based AI tool is sharing and showing about the similar events and information? I asked Lori to kindly prepare something for us on her and Gemini. So I'm going to stop share and let her show you. Some of the responses before. There is the prompt, so if you see the text box here, you'll probably remember the layout of these type of light. This is where she entered. Tell me about the flooding events in Texas.  00:14:18 Speaker 2  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, OK, so R. Look at all this text. Wow. There is a lot of information to take in and it's a little bit different than hearing it on Alexa. The visual signal is a little bit different, right? And I noticed that Doctor do asked you if you could summarize and one thing that I wanted to teach you or point out that what we could do with this big amount of this large amount of text is. Summarized right. So we're getting a lot of information. So maybe we can say. Please summarize. What do you think, R? Three key points, or one paragraph or what would be easiest for you? Do you think?  00:15:15 Speaker 1  Like 3 key points because I like bullet points, so point, yeah.  00:15:18 Speaker 2  Yeah, me too. Yeah, you're a scientist. Love those bullet points, right? Please summarize in three key so key facts, R.    00:15:31 Speaker 1  Yeah, packs. Yeah.  00:15:32 Speaker 2  3 facts with bullet points, right. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's see what we get. So we got this large amount of tax, large amount of information.   00:15:48 Speaker 1  A lot.  00:15:54 Speaker 2  We just modified our prompt. OK, so let's see what we've got here. What do you think? It's still pretty.   00:16:03 Speaker 1  It's. Large, but it's it's more condensed.  Speaker 2  So you think so one week. So do you want to have? Well, let's do you want to like maybe summarize a little bit more?  00:16:14 Speaker 1  Yes, we can ask her for summarized version of this.  00:16:18 Speaker 2  Summarize, summarize each bullet in what do you think one or two sentences?   Speaker 1  Yeah,   Speaker2:  One or two?  Speaker 1:   One  Speaker 2  OK. Let's see what we. Get.  00:16:39 Speaker 2  Well, not bad. What do you think?  00:16:43 Speaker 1  Yeah. That's why it's distinct. I like when it's better to straight to the point like that so.  00:16:48 Speaker 2  OK. Should we ask for more? Like more, you know, more condensed condensation condensed sentences.  00:16:57 Speaker 1  Well, I think it's a good amount for me, but maybe other more small, but I think it's.  00:17:00 Speaker 2  OK. Good.  00:17:02 Speaker 1  Good for me.  00:17:04 Speaker 2  OK what I noticed. Also R is that. The the key facts seem to be bolded.  00:17:13 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:17:13 Speaker 2  Just kind of helpful, I think interesting, yeah. Yeah, because we didn't ask Gemini to do that, but.  00:17:21 Speaker 1  Did that so it's like helpful that way like think it's important, but like she just emphasized it.  00:17:32 Speaker 2  Yeah, I think I think that made it easier to for the information to be scanned visually.  00:17:38 Speaker 1  Yeah, you just see it like that. First one's like people missing like. You think what happened?  00:17:50 Speaker 2  Now, how would you compare that to what you heard on Alexa?  00:17:56 Speaker 1  And I see it visually only a couple bullet points like that it's more. I'm a visual learner so I see it like that it's more. Easy for me to process and like she just says a long paragraph at me. I'm just like what?  00:18:17 Speaker 2  Yeah, good point. Some people are visual learners and some people are auditory learners. Probably, right?  00:18:24 Speaker 1  I'm visual.  00:18:30 Speaker 3  So with this content, R can you? Practice summarizing this key event about the flooding in Texas. Like try not to read the whole text verbatim. You did such a summarizing from the video, which is a a media form and now we're giving you just the plain writing and actually added more details like how many people actually. Which I didn't hear you mentioned that in the previous version of. The quick new. Do you want to retell the key event one more time with some detailed information?  00:19:12 Speaker 1  Alright so. Recently there was a devastating flash flood in Hill Country in Texas and almost like one in 120 people. That are missing and then this historic girls camp has been like. There's a lot of missing campers and. Some of those, like the staff there is not here anymore and a lot of people think this is. Like this? Major flooding could be like low damage in local waterways, so it was really. Like. I'm trying over next to you really. They're really deadly for all these different people in the area and could have been for the ecosystem too, so. It was. A tragedy.  00:20:25 Speaker 3  That's a great summary, R. What? I'm going to ask Laurie to do now is have her copy this three bullet text in the chat box so that you can go to, like, maybe open up a Word document. And then, like, read, massage, reward some of these when we go back to the main room. After we're done with this section of the learning, I'd like you to report back to Michael and tell him. Well, I had some news prepared for you. Here's my news report for today, OK. So that's a hallmark based on what you remember from the video because you saw a lot of like dialogue and then like the lived experiences from the people being interviewed on news and then like a quick summary, these are two different types of information and we're exposed to both types of information all the time to. Remember these key events. So Lori, if you can stop screen share and then drop that in the chat, we'll have you spend some time working on that for a few minutes before we go on to the next one. OK, R, you got the text from.  00:21:49 Speaker 1  I I copied it so you put it on a little Word document again. If you do it again.  00:21:57 Speaker 3  And L, please save this and then we'll put it in a soap note document. Maybe I can open that up real quick. Let me do that as we're speaking. OK, I'm just going to drop this to my clinicians as a private message. This is the soap note document for today. We can add. And here we go. OK. So while R is working on her quick homework assignment. For the clinicians. If you wanted to like again get on Google Gemini, create a quick account if you want to show a demo, we'll use your demo for the next round of questions, OK. OK.So next I wanted to share. I'm trying to find my thing. OK, we talked about news. OK. Can you all see my my screen with this blue color? Yeah, so. Perfect. So one thing about information seeking is we want to know like under what contacts people tend to like, ask these questions whether it's Alexa, these personal assistants or voice assistants or go online, go to Internet or ask your caregivers. Doctors there are a lot of things we can ask for. It could be medically related to your appointment, your therapy, knowing how much exercise you need to work on. So I'd like you to think about the next prompt or thought bubble or thinking ideas you can brainstorm. And this time I want you to try and asking our AI tool what are something around you that you're interested in learning. This could be like. The people in the community, or it could be the geographic location in southern. Yeah. Or it could be like temporal time related, like what's happening in the summer. You mentioned, it feels like summer is really coming there, probably interesting events. I want you to think about a couple of these and what we're going to do is the same business as usual. Some of these prompts you can ask Alexa because Alexa has your like location because it's location based, things you ask Alexa could be can you provide me with some latest or local or international news? This is probably something you're getting from your daily flash debriefing. I know you have that in place. Maybe we can ask Alexa and then we'll try the same with the Gemini to see if we're getting different type of news and feed recommendation. The reason why I want to show you this is you're not asking a specific factual. A specific fact related events like so specific it's about the flood in Texas. Sometimes when you ask for information you want to ask just open-ended questions like just tell me general stuff happening. The like this is more like talking about the science because I know you love this. The algorithm behind these like AI tools or assistive technology or conversational agent is that it has a recommendation system behind it. It learns from your questions, it learns from these preferences and gave you recommendations. You might be interested. So because your device, your Alexa knows you very well, I'm curious to learn how is it going to recommend you stuff locally versus Gemini, which you're probably not super familiar with. And it also is not very. Knowledgeable about your preferences. So we're going to try this out and then we'll wrap up and conclude. Can you potentially maybe hold Alexa or make it more visible and ask this voice command on the right side so we can see what Alexa is telling us about your local news or events? So you just read this off from the screen, OK.  00:26:53 Speaker 1  Ok. Can you provide me with the latest local news?  00:27:02 Speaker 3  Did you say Alexa?   00:27:07 Speaker 1  Alexa, can you provide me with the low, low, latest local and international news?  00:27:27 Speaker 3  Did they recognize you? Let me see if I can paint your screen.  00:27:36 Alexa  Racing District telling us that that tunnel has one way in and one way out. So Lindsey had those workers not been able to scramble over that degree field. This could have been an entirely different scenario. Imagine so. Alright, Kane Whitworth, Phil. Thanks to. You as always. It's been nearly one week since that tragic flooding cave in Texas, and tonight the exhausting search for the missing continues. Now President Trump is set to visit Texas Hill Country, and the growing questions about plans to cut FEMA and leader concerns about just how long it took for officials to issue their warnings. Several has the concerning timeline and the latest from Hill. I'm sorry. Hey, Trevor. Well, Lindsey, we just got an update from officials moments ago that the number of people missing here in Hill Country in Texas has dropped from 172 down to 166. It's not much of movement, but it is the first real movement that we have seen in about 48 hours. It is a massive search effort that's required with thousands of people here on the ground and combing through. The ravaged river banks of the Guadalupe River, and we are a long way from the end of the. Tonight the agonizing search efforts in the Texas Hill Country officials say there's 166 people still missing, the number barely budging in 48 hours. This is the kind of terrain that the search crews are dealing with and flipped over vehicle. All this debris that's piled up high. We have a rescue crew right here. They've got a dog with them.  00:29:01 Speaker 3  I'm going to ask you to tell Alexa to stop.  00:29:05 Speaker 1  Stop. Alexa, stop.  00:29:07 Speaker 3  That's correct. There we go. Good job. So here's my question. Do you feel Alexa registered or heard? What's your command earlier or it was just playing the video that you had it on? Alexa.  00:29:24 Speaker 1  I think when I when I said I. International events, I think you just went straight to like the national news. Yeah, no, like, maybe because I maybe originally asked about it. Maybe it just kind of cued off that.  00:29:42 Speaker 3  Yeah, you also stumbled upon the actual command. As you were saying it. I did notice it had a few words that a little bit hurt, like latest local or international news.  00:29:55 Speaker 1  Yeah, that was a stumble.  00:29:57 Speaker 3  Yeah, let's try that one more time and ask Alexa, OK, you may want to pick one because it's hard to get both local and international news and think about how you want to say this. So Alexa can truly get the specific information you need it. And don't forget to add your keyword like Alexa. OK.  00:30:15 Speaker 1  Yeah, her.  00:30:17 Speaker 3  There was a lot of learning. Remember this summer is training Level 2, so we're like expecting you to do a lot more at the same time and you're doing OK, you're holding up and you're keeping, you're keeping up with your good work. Yeah, let's try that one more time.  00:30:36 Speaker 1  Alexa. Can you provide me with the local? Alexa, can you provide me with the latest local news?  00:30:54 Alexa  Available on Apple TV, Android TV, Android, Smart TV, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire tablet, Roku TV, Samsung Smart TV.  00:31:08 Speaker 1  Stop. Alexa, stop.  00:31:12 Speaker 3  OK.  00:31:13 Speaker 1  Just gave me like all these things you can stream it on this you can get it on that new source.  00:31:19 Speaker 3  So that means this doesn't work. How can we modify this if we're not here training you? You're like asking for local news on your own at home. How would you modify this voice command to be something more specific?  00:31:36 Speaker 1  I'll say her name. Can you provide me with the latest Orange County News or something like or or to where I am? Yeah.  00:31:47 Speaker 3  That's very good. You had you had a very specific location, even though, like, I'm giving you ideas. This is general local, but the Alexa needs to actually know what is local referring to, right. Yeah, that was a good catch. Anything else you think you can help add to this command to make it more specific?  00:32:13 Speaker 1  I may need to give a topic to that news like. You can ask can you provide me the latest? Local biotechnology news or. Local local weather or like, are you going to ask her a date like you know? And I'll come into that like, you know, I asked her what the date that the US open of surfing or something like that, just that would be a specific question. Types when a broad term like, what are some? Like free events this summer at the beach or something like.  00:32:55 Speaker 3  Yeah.  That's a lot of good ideas, R. I think you can probably save them for homework and work on those between. I love the idea about local news related to like biomedical. I think such a great topic that's specific related to news. I know there are some good companies in Orange County and stuff you're interested with that.  00:33:16 Speaker 1  Yeah. And like Irvine, like, you know, this big, big name and it's like Edwards life Sciences, they got a new location here in Irvine testing area. It's like big deal for me.  00:33:33 Speaker 3  That's me. So why don't you take a few minutes to come up with a command you can probably type it. I'm happy to swap it and update the slide real quick so you can read it in visually easy way for you, but let's update the command so you can get new. Information and whatever you put in the chat, I'm going to ask Lori to help us. She's going to put in Gemini and then get a a generated commands and response and we can see what happens, OK. So tell me how you want to change or adapt this Alexa command. We just. Sorry still go to the screen share. But allow me to type on it. In a few minutes, so swap my screen. OK, there we go. OK, so we have this. What would you like me to actually? Say or use for this particular command. Or update on this command.  00:34:40 Speaker 1  Her name? Can you provide me with? Local. Biotechnology news in Orange County.  00:34:55 Speaker 3  Great.  00:34:56 Speaker 1  See what happens.  00:34:58 Speaker 3  Let's reshare this. OK. Can you see the screen OK.  00:35:07 Speaker 1  Yes.  00:35:08 Speaker 3  Wait, OK, let's try. Remember, you got to wake her up, and then we're going to ask this specific question to Alexa. And then once you have it, just do the same, hold it up, and then we. Can see what's on. The screen something well, like nice and good, but we'll give it a. try  00:35:19 Speaker 1  Alright. OK. Alexa. Can you provide me with the with local biotechnology news in Orange County?  00:35:36 Alexa  Here's your name. In northern ducks. After days of promising a home run, it seems the Ducks have barely pulled off an RBI single.  00:35:59 Speaker 1  I might switch right over to like Sports News, so I don't think it moved down. Understand me.  00:36:05 Speaker 3  Oh. I didn't give you what you wanted. Ohh, I'm sorry.  00:36:10 Speaker 1  Went to Anaheim Ducks of all things.  00:36:14 Speaker 3  OK.So it caught the Orange County keywords, but not the bio.  00:36:21 Speaker 1  Bio-technology About analogy could just be like. That's not a term that most like let's say users say like that. So but. Cool. Like I don't know.  00:36:32 Speaker 3  I did notice you also this is the second time you ended up like stumbling upon that word again. So we'll probably do a few like just over articulation practices. So you were comfortable. Word.  00:36:46 Speaker 1  Coming out. Yeah. It's one of my goals in speech therapy, just, like, make it more. Understandable for other people, it's not my most.  00:36:56 Speaker 3  I'm glad I caught a very difficult long word with like multi syllables. So what I'm going to do is let Lori try to show something from Geminiand see if we can have something good.  00:37:09 Speaker 1  OK.  00:37:10 Speaker 3  Satisfactory. That's why we're using multiple AI's, right?  00:37:13 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:37:14 Speaker 3  Lori. And feel free to screen share.  00:38:05 Speaker 2  Give me a second, OK?  00:38:07 Speaker 3  Take your time.  00:38:07 Speaker 2  Here there we go.  00:38:10 Speaker 3  I think I saw your tab. It's like right next to your soap notes tab.  00:38:18 Speaker 2  Here we go. All right. I just typed in the prompt. Can you provide me with local biotechnology news in Orange County? Did I get it right, R?  00:38:30 Speaker 1  She did all right. You can't.  00:38:31 Speaker 2  Here we go. Let's see what we got. Right. We got a lot of very detailed information. Let's see, let me scroll for you. Key developments you see, Irvine? Industry growth check. So in a way, we've got a little too much information, don't.  00:39:04 Speaker 1  Yeah, it's a lot, but like basically bullet points is like I like.  00:39:06 Speaker 2  Is there any? You want bullet points, or do you want to constrain the content at all?  00:39:14 Speaker 1  Both contain the content first.  00:39:16 Speaker 2  OK. OK, So what content do you want? Would you be more interested in like industry content?  00:39:26 Speaker 1  UM. Industry, yeah.  00:39:31 Speaker 2  OK, please. So now we're going to modify that prompt. Please give me industry. Content. On this topic, right. We don't have to say please by the way, but it's kind of nice. OK. All right. OK, now we're getting a little bit more specific. But what's interesting is that now we've got more content.  00:40:12 Speaker 1  Yeah, I just looked down like the paragraph. I heard that I looked at Terminal Edwards, life Sciences. That's a big name in biotech.   00:40:22 Speaker 2  That. An interesting topic too. Should we, should we ask for information about Edwards?  00:40:27 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:40:33 Speaker 2  About Edwards biotech, right.  00:40:36 Speaker 1  Average life Sciences is a.  00:40:37 Speaker 2  Oh, sorry. Life sciences, OK? Why am I not spelling sciences? OK, here we go. All right, so now it almost it lost. It seemed to lose the information about the idea of latest news, and now it's kind of giving us like a core dump. How would we, how would we get back to the latest information, do you think? So we have this was the original prompt. What could we do? How could we modify original prompt?  00:41:32 Speaker 1  Current information about you to like maybe early in this year would be all right, but like 2025?  00:41:34 Speaker 2  There you go. I I like that idea. 02020 Oh, it's even more constrained. OK, let's give 2025 news. How about that? Or should we say news information?  00:41:52 Speaker 1  Some news because like. But but just happened to Edwards.  00:41:58 Speaker 2  OK. I'm just going to copy paste here. And now I'm interested to see what we get. OK. Well, it's giving U.S. financial information, which you probably don't need, right?  00:42:26 Speaker 1  Like you know, I just want, like, actual news that the companies doing current inventions or processes say something if they make the new procedure, that other I was going to pick up like that, they have their name on it, it's gonna be patent. Patent. So if they do that, it's going to be.  00:42:45 Speaker 2  So can you revise that prompt with me? Let's say only. Give me what?  00:43:02 Speaker 1  New Edwards sciences. Procedures. Procedures see what happened.  00:43:10 Speaker 2  Procedures. OK, only give me information. On new. 20 on new procedures.  00:43:23 Speaker 1  Yeah. Do it there.  00:43:37 Speaker 2  OK, so that helped a little bit, huh? Transcatheter aortic valve replacement?  00:43:40 Speaker 1  Yeah. Yeah, they're like, you know, in your heart, you got these valves and they're making new ones.  00:43:48 Speaker 2  Cool. OK. What I like here or what's interesting is. They give us what's new and then significance, right?  00:43:58 Speaker 1  Yeah, it was. They they got this new thing, but it was going to do this. That's right. It's important. Yeah. Like learning about stuff like that.  00:44:08 Speaker 2  So is there anything that you want to do to make this even more condensed? Here's the prompt. We have only give me information on your procedures, so we did get. We did get the information we wanted, but do you want to ask for bullet points this time? Like one sentence bullet points.  00:44:34 Speaker 1  Yeah, one cents bullet points it condense it more because straight to the fact points.  00:44:41 Speaker 2  OK, so why don't you give me the prompt? This is what we had before.  00:44:53 Speaker 1  Yeah. Uhm. And then remember, Genesis or whatever her name.  00:45:07 Speaker 2  When you said you said condense.  00:45:10 Speaker 1  I like condensed information about the. Is. 2025 new procedures.  00:45:19 Speaker 2  OK, I think you I think I could just say condense to one bullet .1 sentence. Bullet points, OK.  00:45:27 Speaker 1  3/20.  00:45:27 Speaker 2  See what we get. I don't think we need to do. This. But I'm just going to put this in. For. For learning. Condense this information. To one sentence, bullet points, let's see what we get. Well. What do you think? Do we lose? Do we lose anything valuable or are you happy with what we've got here?  00:46:09 Speaker 1  I can. I'm happy with it, but like most like I know this area like these terms you're using, but if someone has more of a. Like a lay person's perspective about like what Edwards is doing, we kind of. A lot of detail, so you can go right over the head, but maybe if I'm asking about. I'm really directed into this field, but I wanted to have a casual. Background into I want to learn about it, but it kind of be a lot, so I'll be like too much.  00:46:48 Speaker 2  So do you think that if you wanted to get that more scientific detail that you could or?  00:46:59 Speaker 2  Do you think you could figure out how to? Do that.  00:47:03 Speaker 1  Yeah, I could. Just ask for that. Make make my command specific about. The topic I would like to learn more about, yeah.  00:47:24 Speaker 2  So Doctor do do we have more time or? Should we wrap? That.  00:47:29 Speaker 3  I'm looking at the slides. I don't think we have time for another one, but R, are you to maybe share one or two pieces of news or information? You looked up this session to the rest of the team and as well as M.  00:47:47 Speaker 1  Uhm, I just uhm. Looked at some. New updates and like this company, Edwards, Life Science doing some. New procedures for like. Monitoring the heart valve transplants and like that's, I feel that I like to look into because. My. Background is in life sciences, so you know they're in the area. So where I live, it's like it's good for me to be up to date on my field. Yeah.  00:48:25 Speaker 3  That's great. So between now and next time, which is a new topic that we're going to to introduce to you, you can use these AI tools to get this up to date information. You get it in a very easy to read and process format rather than links and pages, which may seem very overwhelming. For you.  00:48:46 Speaker 1  Yeah. It's like too much.  00:48:49 Speaker 3  And then the Alexa sometimes won't give you the proper information. So this is just another tool to help you, kind of like supplement. There's that gap in whatever you are doing and you can use this either on the phone as a mobile app or on the web page. So a quick homework for you. Set up your Gemini account, explore some of the things related to like news and facts like. Since you love this company, use the AI to do some to do some research and how they are hyperlinks, because sometimes a makes up stuff. So maybe like look up their website to see if these key informations are accurate. OK, so next week, before we start our session, we're going to ask you, hey, tell us about this Edwards Biotech company because none of us know anything about it. You're going. To be the expert.  00:49:38 Speaker 1  Right.  00:49:39 Speaker 3  Great. I'm going to ask everyone to get ready to be back to the main room. R, you want to practice? Just like your little blurb about the flood event, the flooding event, the disaster in Texas. You got my little notes. OK, I will get ready to have. People come back OK.        , \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next.

While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT>  In this response, I will summarize and format the provided content on SOAP notes following the structure and style described in the rubric:\n\nTitle: SOAP Notes: An Essential Tool for Healthcare Documentation and Communication\n\nIntroduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) note is a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. Developed by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago, this structure provides a framework for evaluating information, cognitive aid, and potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.\n\nFunction\nThe SOAP note consists of four headings: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Each heading is described below.\n\nSubjective\nThe Subjective section documents the patient's personal views or feelings, interim information, and context for the assessment and plan. It includes Chief Complaint (CC) and History of Present Illness (HPI). The HPI begins with a simple opening statement including the patient's age, sex, and reason for the visit.\n\nObjective\nThe Objective section documents objective data from the patient encounter, including vital signs, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging results, other diagnostic data, and recognition of other clinicians' documentation.\n\nAssessment\nThe Assessment section documents the synthesis of subjective and objective evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. It includes the problem list, differential diagnosis, discussion, and plan for each problem.\n\nPlan\nThe Plan section details the need for additional testing, consultation with other clinicians, patient education, counseling, and therapy needed (medications).\n\nIssues of Concern\nA weakness of the SOAP note is its inability to document changes over time. To address this gap, extensions to the SOAP model include acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E reminding to assess how well the plan has worked.\n\nClinical Significance\nThe advantage of a SOAP note is organizing relevant information for easy access and quick understanding. It helps clinicians follow the document more efficiently, making it essential for communication between healthcare professionals. However, electronic documentation risks burdening busy clinicians with excessive data, necessitating the need to make the most clinically relevant data easily accessible and immediately available.\n\nConclusion\nThe SOAP note is an essential tool for healthcare providers, ensuring organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation of patient information. Its adoption has simplified communication between healthcare professionals, improving overall care and outcomes. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK> To enhance the system prompt's effectiveness in guiding the language model's (LLM) reasoning strategy towards accurate and informative responses, we can suggest the following improvements:\n\n1. Provide a clear context for the LLM to understand the objective function better: The prompt should be more specific about what is expected from the response, focusing on providing insights into how the SOAP note system benefits healthcare communication within the context of Gemini/Alexa summer training sessions. This will help the LLM generate responses that directly address the objective function and align with the conversation history.\n2. Encourage the LLM to provide practical examples and benefits: The prompt should encourage the LLM to offer concrete examples or case studies that demonstrate how the structured SOAP note format facilitates effective communication between healthcare professionals in training sessions, leading to improved care and outcomes for patients.\n3. Emphasize the importance of accurate and detailed documentation: To ensure the LLM focuses on the significance of thorough and precise documentation, the prompt should explicitly ask it to discuss how organized, structured, and comprehensive documentation aids in identifying patterns, making diagnoses more accurate, and improving treatment plans.\n4. Address potential challenges or limitations: The prompt should ask the LLM to acknowledge any difficulties that may arise when using the SOAP note system, such as overlooking important information or misinterpreting data due to poorly structured notes. This will encourage the LLM to suggest strategies for addressing these issues and improving the overall quality of the response.\n5. Encourage a clear call-to-action: The prompt should ask the LLM to offer specific suggestions for how healthcare providers can effectively implement and utilize the SOAP note system in their practices, including tips on writing clear and concise subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, as well as best practices for organizing and storing SOAP notes for easy access and retrieval.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements into the system prompt, we can help guide the LLM's reasoning strategy towards generating more accurate and informative responses that better align with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}
