Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 (Week 2) R.T.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- **Patient Name:** R.T.\n- **Date:** 07-25-2024\n- **Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n- **Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses interest in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  \n- **History of Present Illness (HPI):** \n  - R.T. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who enjoys various forms of entertainment, including movies, music, and games. \n  - R.T. reports a preference for watching trending movies and enjoys the experience of going to theaters, particularly for comedies. \n  - R.T. uses a laptop and cell phone for entertainment, frequently accessing YouTube for music and social media to connect with friends. \n  - R.T. has a Spotify account for music streaming and enjoys listening to old folk and rock music while working on tasks that require concentration, such as typing for a laboratory license renewal.\n  - R.T. also enjoys watching shows like \"Wipeout\" and \"American Ninja Warrior\" for their competitive nature.\n  \n- **Current Medications:** None reported.\n  \n- **Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n- **Vital Signs:** Not assessed during the session.\n  \n- **Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Laboratory Data:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Imaging Results:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Other Diagnostic Data:** \n  - R.T. demonstrated the ability to set reminders and alarms using the voice-activated device (Speaker 15).\n  - R.T. successfully connected to Spotify and YouTube for music and video playback.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Problem 1:** Difficulty in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n    - Lack of familiarity with voice-activated technology.\n    - Potential cognitive overload when managing multiple applications.\n  - **Discussion:** R.T. shows enthusiasm for using technology but may benefit from further guidance on maximizing its use for entertainment and reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Education and Training:**\n   - Continue to provide R.T. with practical demonstrations on how to use Speaker 15 for various entertainment functions, including setting reminders, playing music, and accessing videos.\n   - Encourage R.T. to create playlists on Spotify and explore YouTube for content that aligns with their interests.\n\n2. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess R.T.'s comfort level with the technology and address any challenges faced in using the device for entertainment.\n   - Encourage R.T. to practice using the device independently and report back on their experiences.\n\n3. **Patient Engagement:**\n   - Suggest R.T. explore new genres of music or shows to enhance their entertainment experience.\n   - Recommend R.T. to engage with family members or friends to share experiences and learn together about using the technology.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- R.T. appears motivated to learn and utilize technology for entertainment, indicating a positive outlook on integrating these tools into daily life.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 (Week 2) R.T.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good.

Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- **Patient Name:** R.T.\n- **Date:** 07-25-2024\n- **Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n- **Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses interest in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  \n- **History of Present Illness (HPI):** \n  - R.T. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who enjoys various forms of entertainment, including movies, music, and games. \n  - R.T. reports a preference for watching trending movies and enjoys the experience of going to theaters, particularly for comedies. \n  - R.T. uses a laptop and cell phone for entertainment, frequently accessing YouTube for music and social media to connect with friends. \n  - R.T. has a Spotify account for music streaming and enjoys listening to old folk and rock music while working on tasks that require concentration, such as typing for a laboratory license renewal.\n  - R.T. also enjoys watching shows like \"Wipeout\" and \"American Ninja Warrior\" for their competitive nature.\n  \n- **Current Medications:** None reported.\n  \n- **Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n- **Vital Signs:** Not assessed during the session.\n  \n- **Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Laboratory Data:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Imaging Results:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Other Diagnostic Data:** \n  - R.T. demonstrated the ability to set reminders and alarms using the voice-activated device (Speaker 15).\n  - R.T. successfully connected to Spotify and YouTube for music and video playback.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Problem 1:** Difficulty in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n    - Lack of familiarity with voice-activated technology.\n    - Potential cognitive overload when managing multiple applications.\n  - **Discussion:** R.T. shows enthusiasm for using technology but may benefit from further guidance on maximizing its use for entertainment and reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Education and Training:**\n   - Continue to provide R.T. with practical demonstrations on how to use Speaker 15 for various entertainment functions, including setting reminders, playing music, and accessing videos.\n   - Encourage R.T. to create playlists on Spotify and explore YouTube for content that aligns with their interests.\n\n2. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess R.T.'s comfort level with the technology and address any challenges faced in using the device for entertainment.\n   - Encourage R.T. to practice using the device independently and report back on their experiences.\n\n3. **Patient Engagement:**\n   - Suggest R.T. explore new genres of music or shows to enhance their entertainment experience.\n   - Recommend R.T. to engage with family members or friends to share experiences and learn together about using the technology.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- R.T. appears motivated to learn and utilize technology for entertainment, indicating a positive outlook on integrating these tools into daily life.

A:   3.  User  Needs:  Rosie  appropriately  responded  to  all  user  needs  assessment  interview  questions. During user needs assessment, pt was thoughtful and thorough when responding to each question. Pt independently identified appropriate scenarios related to personal entertainment use (i.e., watching Youtube playlist of the show, \u201cWIPE OUT,\u201d playing an audio book, asking about the weather, playing one artist\u2019s songs from a specific decade).   4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  met  her  goal  of  using  concise  voice  commands  in  80%  of  trials  to  set a timer on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues. Pt demonstrated intelligible speech when verbalizing Alexa voice commands and executed 15 commands successfully and independently given an initial model. One command, \u201cfast forward\u201d on Alexa was not supported and unable to be executed for this reason. In a group setting, pt demonstrated appropriate paralinguistic and pragmatic responses to other participants\u2019 successes with executing commands via head nods and encouraging comments.   P:  Week  2  homework  will  be  assigned.  Metacognitive  strategy  will  be  implemented  in  next  week\u2019s session to allow pt to reflect and provide feedback on use of Alexa throughout the week to discuss Alexa use for personal needs and ADLs.       \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- **Patient Name:** R.T.\n- **Date:** 07-25-2024\n- **Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n- **Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses interest in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  \n- **History of Present Illness (HPI):** \n  - R.T. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who enjoys various forms of entertainment, including movies, music, and games. \n  - R.T. reports a preference for watching trending movies and enjoys the experience of going to theaters, particularly for comedies. \n  - R.T. uses a laptop and cell phone for entertainment, frequently accessing YouTube for music and social media to connect with friends. \n  - R.T. has a Spotify account for music streaming and enjoys listening to old folk and rock music while working on tasks that require concentration, such as typing for a laboratory license renewal.\n  - R.T. also enjoys watching shows like \"Wipeout\" and \"American Ninja Warrior\" for their competitive nature.\n  \n- **Current Medications:** None reported.\n  \n- **Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n- **Vital Signs:** Not assessed during the session.\n  \n- **Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Laboratory Data:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Imaging Results:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Other Diagnostic Data:** \n  - R.T. demonstrated the ability to set reminders and alarms using the voice-activated device (Speaker 15).\n  - R.T. successfully connected to Spotify and YouTube for music and video playback.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Problem 1:** Difficulty in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n    - Lack of familiarity with voice-activated technology.\n    - Potential cognitive overload when managing multiple applications.\n  - **Discussion:** R.T. shows enthusiasm for using technology but may benefit from further guidance on maximizing its use for entertainment and reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Education and Training:**\n   - Continue to provide R.T. with practical demonstrations on how to use Speaker 15 for various entertainment functions, including setting reminders, playing music, and accessing videos.\n   - Encourage R.T. to create playlists on Spotify and explore YouTube for content that aligns with their interests.\n\n2. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess R.T.'s comfort level with the technology and address any challenges faced in using the device for entertainment.\n   - Encourage R.T. to practice using the device independently and report back on their experiences.\n\n3. **Patient Engagement:**\n   - Suggest R.T. explore new genres of music or shows to enhance their entertainment experience.\n   - Recommend R.T. to engage with family members or friends to share experiences and learn together about using the technology.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- R.T. appears motivated to learn and utilize technology for entertainment, indicating a positive outlook on integrating these tools into daily life.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the differences:\n\n1. **Structure and Content**: \n   - The generated note includes a detailed patient information section, which is not present in the target note. The target note is more concise and focused on the therapy session.\n   - The subjective section in the generated note is longer and includes more personal details about the patient's preferences and activities, while the target note is more focused on the patient's goals and performance in therapy.\n\n2. **Goals and Objectives**: \n   - The target note explicitly states a goal related to using concise voice commands with a specific accuracy percentage and cue level. The generated note lacks a clear goal statement and does not quantify the patient's performance in a similar manner.\n   - The objective section in the target note includes specific trials and outcomes related to the use of voice commands, which is not mirrored in the generated note.\n\n3. **Assessment and Plan**: \n   - The assessment in the generated note discusses potential cognitive overload and lack of familiarity, which is not mentioned in the target note. The target note focuses on the patient's performance and responses during the session.\n   - The plan in the generated note is more general and lacks specific homework assignments or strategies mentioned in the target note.\n\n4. **Terminology and Focus**: \n   - The generated note uses more clinical language and includes sections that are not relevant to the therapy session (e.g., vital signs, medications), while the target note is more focused on the therapy process and outcomes.\n\nOverall, the generated SOAP note diverges significantly from the target note in terms of focus, detail, and structure.\n\n**Score: 7** (indicating a moderate to high level of difference) </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback and criticism to the variable given the above evaluation output.
