Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK.

I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint.

Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history.

This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis.

For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on.

Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK.

So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK.

Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that.

Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that.

Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands? From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that.

Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK.

So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that.

Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that.

Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called?

It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right.

Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK.

So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK.

Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK.

Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK.

Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC.

All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands? From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that.

Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

M.A.\u2019s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: \u201cStart timer for 20 sec\u201d in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command \u201cstop timer\u201d in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like \u201cCan you remind me to play video games?\u201d and \u201c Do you want to remind me to play video games?\u201d  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A\u2019s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician\u2019s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands? From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

M.A.\u2019s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.

Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: \u201cStart timer for 20 sec\u201d in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command \u201cstop timer\u201d in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like \u201cCan you remind me to play video games?\u201d and \u201c Do you want to remind me to play video games?\u201d  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A\u2019s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician\u2019s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.

Here are some points of comparison:\n\n1. **Subjective Section:**\n   - Both notes include a clear chief complaint and history of present illness, detailing the patient's current situation and goals. The generated note captures the patient's engagement with the Alexa device and their satisfaction, which aligns with the ground truth's focus on user needs assessment and caregiver involvement.\n\n2. **Objective Section:**\n   - The generated note appropriately notes that vital signs and physical exam findings are not applicable, similar to the ground truth's focus on user needs and technology interaction rather than medical assessments. It also mentions the successful use of the Alexa device, which is a key aspect of the session.\n\n3. **Assessment Section:**\n   - The assessment in the generated note identifies the primary problem and discusses the patient's progress and feelings about their experience. This mirrors the ground truth's assessment of the participant's abilities and the need for caregiver support.\n\n4. **Plan Section:**\n   - The plan in the generated note outlines specific actions to continue improving the patient's skills with the Alexa device, which is consistent with the ground truth's focus on home exercises and ongoing training. It also includes patient education and follow-up plans, which are crucial for continuity of care.\n\n5. **Overall Clarity and Detail:**\n   - The generated note is clear and provides sufficient detail about the patient's needs and the session's focus. However, it could benefit from more specific examples of commands practiced, similar to the detailed scenarios provided in the ground truth.\n\nIn summary, while the generated SOAP Note is strong and captures the essential elements of the session, it could be improved by including more specific examples of commands practiced and the patient's responses to those commands, as seen in the ground truth. Overall, it is a good representation of a SOAP Note but may not reach the same level of detail and specificity as the ground truth.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny.

I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

This would align with the ground truth's detailed scenarios and provide a clearer picture of the patient's progress and areas needing improvement.\n\n2. **Patient's Responses and Challenges:**\n   - Incorporate more detailed observations about Patient M.'s responses to the commands, including any challenges faced, such as difficulty with certain commands or the need for verbal cues. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the patient's abilities and align with the ground truth's detailed feedback on command execution.\n\n3. **Caregiver Involvement:**\n   - Highlight the role of the caregiver in supporting Patient M. during the session. The ground truth emphasizes caregiver involvement, which is crucial for understanding the patient's support system and the dynamics of the session.\n\n4. **Progress and Emotional Response:**\n   - While the note mentions the patient's satisfaction, it could delve deeper into the emotional response and motivation levels, similar to the ground truth's assessment of the participant's engagement and willingness to participate.\n\n5. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Consider including a more structured home exercise program with specific tasks and commands for Patient M. to practice, as seen in the ground truth. This would provide clear guidance for continued practice outside of the session.\n\n6. **Use of Technology:**\n   - The note could benefit from discussing any technological challenges or adaptations used during the session, such as the use of specific devices or apps, which are mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n7. **Follow-Up and Future Goals:**\n   - Expand on the follow-up plan by setting specific goals for the next session and outlining any anticipated challenges or areas of focus. This would provide a clearer roadmap for the patient's progress and align with the ground truth's detailed plan.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the SOAP Note would provide a more detailed and comprehensive account of the session, aligning more closely with the ground truth and improving the evaluation metric. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the question to the LLM for this conversation.

And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK.

Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model and enhance the evaluation metric, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Specificity in Commands Practiced:**\n   - The SOAP Note could benefit from including specific examples of the voice commands that Patient M. practiced during the session. This would align with the ground truth's detailed scenarios and provide a clearer picture of the patient's progress and areas needing improvement.\n\n2. **Patient's Responses and Challenges:**\n   - Incorporate more detailed observations about Patient M.'s responses to the commands, including any challenges faced, such as difficulty with certain commands or the need for verbal cues. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the patient's abilities and align with the ground truth's detailed feedback on command execution.\n\n3. **Caregiver Involvement:**\n   - Highlight the role of the caregiver in supporting Patient M. during the session. The ground truth emphasizes caregiver involvement, which is crucial for understanding the patient's support system and the dynamics of the session.\n\n4. **Progress and Emotional Response:**\n   - While the note mentions the patient's satisfaction, it could delve deeper into the emotional response and motivation levels, similar to the ground truth's assessment of the participant's engagement and willingness to participate.\n\n5. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Consider including a more structured home exercise program with specific tasks and commands for Patient M. to practice, as seen in the ground truth. This would provide clear guidance for continued practice outside of the session.\n\n6. **Use of Technology:**\n   - The note could benefit from discussing any technological challenges or adaptations used during the session, such as the use of specific devices or apps, which are mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n7. **Follow-Up and Future Goals:**\n   - Expand on the follow-up plan by setting specific goals for the next session and outlining any anticipated challenges or areas of focus. This would provide a clearer roadmap for the patient's progress and align with the ground truth's detailed plan.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the SOAP Note would provide a more detailed and comprehensive account of the session, aligning more closely with the ground truth and improving the evaluation metric. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands? From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK.

Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny.

I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

M.A.\u2019s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: \u201cStart timer for 20 sec\u201d in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command \u201cstop timer\u201d in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like \u201cCan you remind me to play video games?\u201d and \u201c Do you want to remind me to play video games?\u201d  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A\u2019s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician\u2019s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays\u201d  /  \u201cAlexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment\u201d   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games\u201d  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games\u201d    Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom\u2019s  birthday  on  Aug  25\u201d   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.

The generated note captures the patient's engagement with the Alexa device and their satisfaction, which aligns with the ground truth's focus on user needs assessment and caregiver involvement.\n\n2. **Objective Section:**\n   - The generated note appropriately notes that vital signs and physical exam findings are not applicable, similar to the ground truth's focus on user needs and technology interaction rather than medical assessments. It also mentions the successful use of the Alexa device, which is a key aspect of the session.\n\n3. **Assessment Section:**\n   - The assessment in the generated note identifies the primary problem and discusses the patient's progress and feelings about their experience. This mirrors the ground truth's assessment of the participant's abilities and the need for caregiver support.\n\n4. **Plan Section:**\n   - The plan in the generated note outlines specific actions to continue improving the patient's skills with the Alexa device, which is consistent with the ground truth's focus on home exercises and ongoing training. It also includes patient education and follow-up plans, which are crucial for continuity of care.\n\n5. **Overall Clarity and Detail:**\n   - The generated note is clear and provides sufficient detail about the patient's needs and the session's focus. However, it could benefit from more specific examples of commands practiced, similar to the detailed scenarios provided in the ground truth.\n\nIn summary, while the generated SOAP Note is strong and captures the essential elements of the session, it could be improved by including more specific examples of commands practiced and the patient's responses to those commands, as seen in the ground truth. Overall, it is a good representation of a SOAP Note but may not reach the same level of detail and specificity as the ground truth.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places.

M.A.\u2019s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: \u201cStart timer for 20 sec\u201d in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command \u201cstop timer\u201d in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like \u201cCan you remind me to play video games?\u201d and \u201c Do you want to remind me to play video games?\u201d  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A\u2019s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician\u2019s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands? From the previous week.\n00:00:20 Speaker 1\nJust a few.\n00:00:21 Speaker 2\nWhat? Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint.

One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available.

Alright, So what we're going to do first is you're going to show me how you could set up an set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4.\n00:00:34 Speaker 3\nOK, let me. I muted it so I'll unmute it for you.\n00:00:38 Speaker 2\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:00:42 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you set an appointment for? 545 from.\n00:00:57 Speaker 3\nI think you have to try that again, Speaker 1, I don't know. That she heard.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nYou. Hey, Speaker 4, can you set an appointment for 5:45 for me? PM.\n00:01:07 Speaker 4\nGot it on what day?\n00:01:08 Speaker 1\nThank you. Today.\n00:01:12 Speaker 4\nAnd what's the name of the event?\n00:01:15 Speaker 1\nClass.\n00:01:17 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added them.\n00:01:19 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:01:23 Speaker 2\nPerfect. OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK.

Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

This would align with the ground truth's detailed scenarios and provide a clearer picture of the patient's progress and areas needing improvement.\n\n2. **Patient's Responses and Challenges:**\n   - Incorporate more detailed observations about Patient M.'s responses to the commands, including any challenges faced, such as difficulty with certain commands or the need for verbal cues. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the patient's abilities and align with the ground truth's detailed feedback on command execution.\n\n3. **Caregiver Involvement:**\n   - Highlight the role of the caregiver in supporting Patient M. during the session. The ground truth emphasizes caregiver involvement, which is crucial for understanding the patient's support system and the dynamics of the session.\n\n4. **Progress and Emotional Response:**\n   - While the note mentions the patient's satisfaction, it could delve deeper into the emotional response and motivation levels, similar to the ground truth's assessment of the participant's engagement and willingness to participate.\n\n5. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Consider including a more structured home exercise program with specific tasks and commands for Patient M. to practice, as seen in the ground truth. This would provide clear guidance for continued practice outside of the session.\n\n6. **Use of Technology:**\n   - The note could benefit from discussing any technological challenges or adaptations used during the session, such as the use of specific devices or apps, which are mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n7. **Follow-Up and Future Goals:**\n   - Expand on the follow-up plan by setting specific goals for the next session and outlining any anticipated challenges or areas of focus. This would provide a clearer roadmap for the patient's progress and align with the ground truth's detailed plan.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the SOAP Note would provide a more detailed and comprehensive account of the session, aligning more closely with the ground truth and improving the evaluation metric. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \nfollowing conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right.

Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK.

So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on.

Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that.

Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie?

Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC.

All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \nensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M., a visually impaired individual, is learning to use voice commands with their Alexa device to set reminders and engage in entertainment activities. \n- The session focused on practicing commands to set appointments, reminders, and explore entertainment options such as sports, music, and games.\n- Patient M. expressed satisfaction with their ability to set an appointment independently and showed interest in using the device for various activities.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** Visually impaired.\n- **Social History:** Enjoys watching sports (ice hockey), playing video games, and listening to music.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for more accurate responses, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Incorporate Specificity in Command Practice:**\n   - The system prompt should encourage the LLM to extract and document specific examples of voice commands practiced by the patient. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to pay attention to detailed scenarios and interactions during the session, ensuring that these are reflected in the SOAP Note.\n\n2. **Emphasize Patient's Responses and Challenges:**\n   - The prompt should guide the LLM to focus on capturing detailed observations of the patient's responses to commands, including any challenges or difficulties encountered. This can be done by instructing the LLM to listen for verbal cues and non-verbal indicators of the patient's engagement and understanding.\n\n3. **Highlight Caregiver Involvement:**\n   - The prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to note the role of the caregiver in the session. This includes documenting how the caregiver supports the patient and any interactions that highlight the dynamics between the patient and caregiver.\n\n4. **Detail Emotional Response and Motivation:**\n   - Encourage the LLM to delve deeper into the patient's emotional responses and motivation levels. The prompt can include guidance on identifying and documenting the patient's engagement, satisfaction, and willingness to participate, providing a more comprehensive view of the session.\n\n5. **Structure Home Exercise Program:**\n   - The prompt should guide the LLM to create a structured home exercise program with specific tasks and commands for the patient to practice. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to consider the session's content and the patient's progress when formulating these exercises.\n\n6. **Discuss Technological Challenges and Adaptations:**\n   - The prompt should encourage the LLM to document any technological challenges or adaptations used during the session. This includes noting specific devices or apps and any issues encountered, providing a clearer picture of the session's context.\n\n7. **Expand Follow-Up and Future Goals:**\n   - The prompt should guide the LLM to set specific goals for the next session and outline anticipated challenges or areas of focus. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to consider the patient's current progress and potential areas for improvement.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into the system prompt, the LLM will be better equipped to generate a detailed and comprehensive SOAP Note that aligns with the objective function and improves the evaluation metric.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}
