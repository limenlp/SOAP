Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-24 (Week 4) R.T.

Appointments.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nOK, very good. Alright, so have you been able to access the homework link OK. Or.\n00:00:18 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, umm the you. I have like e-mail thread from like the like. The Speaker 3 study and my e-mail. I just click it. Yeah. And I can put it, it goes up in my browser I can just type it.\n00:00:22 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:00:27 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, good. So you can, UM, I think there's some questions and then you can like record yourself.\n00:00:36 Speaker 2\nYeah, and take a video and submit.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yeah. I thought that was such a cool platform. I never worked with that. And I was like, wow, this. Is really.\n00:00:45 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:00:47 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK. Me. OK, so Speaker 2 today the topic is news and facts, so kind of talking about like asking Speaker 3 to schedule. You don't like turning on the news and telling us what's going on. Do you have any goals? In terms of. Using Speaker 3 for news and facts.\n00:01:21 Speaker 2\nIf there's like something important going on like the Olympics or like an election a couple weeks, like maybe I can ask her, like, how are the polls in California or something like that? Or I live in California, just like Orange County or something like that. And maybe, like, I can ask, like, who won the 100m? Dash to the Olympics like you know, people are like here say ohh Noah Lyles like. Like that guy? There's some other guys.\n00:01:51 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, I actually watched the documentary about Noah Lyles on Netflix, so I was, like, amazed. And then, yeah.\n00:01:59 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:02:02 Speaker 1\nDo you watch Netflix, Speaker 2?\n00:02:05 Speaker 2\nI think, well, my mom has, like, every different streaming. So like always has checked her here and there.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. There's so many Netflix documentaries now on the Olympic athletes like Simone Biles, and yeah, the sprinters and stuff. Awesome. OK. Genevieve, would you like to take it away? Is your needs OK? OK.\n00:02:31 Speaker 4\nSure. So also I was just writing in the goal and then it just got. Deleted. Oh, is it? I'm not sure. I think I just pressed something.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nAnd delete it. OK, maybe can you do undo and see if it comes back up?\n00:02:54\nIt's not.\n00:02:57 Speaker 4\nI can rewrite it.\n00:02:58 Speaker 1\nOhh that's OK I I. Got it you can proceed.\n00:03:02 Speaker 4\nOK. All right. So first we kind of you kind of just talked about it, but what type of information do you want to listen to the news floor?\n00:03:16 Speaker 2\nWell, if there's like, you know, a big event like, no, everyone's talking about or like you heard it on other platforms like social media or something. Ohh, what do you think about this Olympic racer or some kind of like running topic that, you know, sports or? Like something like, you know, people, you know, people don't wanna, like, talk about elections. But like, sometimes it comes in your head. You wanna talk about it? So maybe you can just like, maybe ask her something about like. Like you know, this year's Olympics, you may have break dancing. Maybe like we'll ask her, like, who's the women's break dancing for the US? I don't know how to.\n00:04:02 Speaker 4\nHey, that's awesome. I'm sorry. Dance.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nThe Champions? Yeah. Or maybe they're like, maybe like the athlete or whoever they want to do it, OK.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nAll right. And then what topics are you interested in discussing or learning more about, like there's cars or fishing or sports or health? Is there anything that you you wanna find out more about?\n00:04:36 Speaker 2\nWell, I like water sports, swimming and surfing.\n00:04:41 Speaker 4\nOK. Do you want to learn more about swimming and surfing? Is there anything else you want to learn more about?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nWell, like science are like recent science like.\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nLike news or like, you know, my background is in genetics like lab testing. So like you know there's like something called crisper. It's like like doing individual medicine by altering people's genes. So send this to some like the front page news. So it's like. Wow. Yeah, it's in there somewhere.\n00:05:23 Speaker 4\nSo you'd want us ask about it so that Speaker 3 could maybe expand on that. Yeah. So how would you ask that question?\n00:05:35 Speaker 2\nAlright, maybe make a call, say her name, and then say. I think. Are there not? Don't always say that I'm. Is there any news about gene editing currently or something like that?\n00:05:54 Speaker 4\nOK, great. Alright, yeah. I wish I knew more about that.\n00:06:06 Speaker 2\nI know like no. Currently there's some people who have, like, a family trait, like sickle cell anemia. They cut it as soon as they got, like, cut it out of the genome or some people they call, they get designer babies. They try to edit their baby when they when they're born they want like perfect, you know, types thing. Some people do that not me, but it's out there, right.\n00:06:36 Speaker 4\nOK. So can you think of 10 scenarios to complete the sentence? I want to ask or know more about?\n00:06:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:06:49 Speaker 4\nSo is there like 10 things you want to learn more about?\n00:06:55 Speaker 2\nI will. I want to learn more about the US break dancing team. Or Olympic break dancing team. And then maybe say. Who is the US athlete athlete in the 100m butterfly? And then. UM. Who is the? Female US Olympian in the 100 meter dash. It's running then. Are there is it? Are there any Olympic pair break break dancing? I didn't think it was this different categories and sports was like single and double so.\n00:08:02 Speaker 4\nYeah. Is there any non sports related things that you wanted to learn about?\n00:08:10 Speaker 2\nUM. Well, like you know, sometimes there's some stuff like. My son is on TV. That was like like. Well, sometimes is like a bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever's on TV. And like, they will see who it is now. It's like, it's like, want to talk about it? I'm just like, it's usually the same script, but just different guys.\n00:08:36 Speaker 4\nRight, yeah. Been up to date.\n00:08:40 Speaker 2\nYeah, she would like. Ohh. Like shows like that.\n00:08:46 Speaker 4\nOK. Anything else?\n00:08:55 Speaker 2\nMaybe I can ask her to. Maybe like what is the biggest like is it the front page news in the LA Times or something like big newspaper or New York Times or like? There's different news on the East Coast and the West Coast and different topics I used to live back east for college, and sometimes they paid for weather. It's like this long and like there's something called sleep.\n00:09:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nSure.\n00:09:32 Speaker 4\nWell, yeah, I think if you asked that for today, then every day it would change. So you'd be able to stay up on the neighbors.\n00:09:39 Speaker 2\nNews up to date, yeah.\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nThat's great. Is there anything else that you that you think you want to learn more about?\n00:09:50 Speaker 2\nUhm. Maybe I can ask her to say, like what? The weather is in my town. Or like, where my sister lives or my cousins live in, say, maybe wanna check in with. I'm gonna go with it later. I can check the weather first or something.\n00:10:11 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah, those are great topics that we can look at. Are you someone that likes to keep up on what's going on?\n00:10:21 Speaker 2\nYes, cause sometimes this phone talks to you, like mention it or just like what? But you need to be up to date.\n00:10:35 Speaker 1\nAwesome. OK. So Speaker 2, so I get you are very interested in sports such as swimming and maybe break dancing and and surfing water sports. Awesome.\n00:10:50 Speaker 2\nAnd also surfing. Yeah, I like modern sports. I like.\n00:10:58 Speaker 1\nOh, maybe for surfing. Is there anything that you're particularly interested in asking Speaker 3 about surfing?\n00:11:07 Speaker 2\nUM. Well. I was was like trying to. I think they have two athletes of different genders. I know that one of the girls is called Caroline Marks. I don't really know who the other surfer is. Maybe I'll ask her who they both are or something.\n00:11:26 Speaker 1\nOK, looks good. So who are the surf athletes?\n00:11:34 Speaker 2\nOhh, the Olympics are maybe the Olympic female surf athletes are are maybe US Olympics.\n00:11:47 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK, OK. And then the last thing we want to see and check on Speaker 2 is just how you create. Remember, last week we learned about creating a medication list. Do you still remember the command that you would use to? First create the medication list. On your Speaker 3 device.\n00:12:12 Speaker 2\nYou. Ask her for. Remember, it's like if you ask for. A list or something? Really reminder and you say I want and you add like either I type it or say like I want to add like. Like my two like like ohh my anti seizure meds and like Tylenol and and a couple of things, yeah.\n00:12:37 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So and. But in order to create that list, we would just say, Speaker 3, create a medication list. So do you want to go ahead and try that?\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nIt's called medication. What should I add to it?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nHe just woke up. Keppra.\n00:12:55 Speaker 3\nWe already have a list called medication.\n00:13:01 Speaker 2\nSo I ask, can you add Keppra?\n00:13:08 Speaker 3\nI've added Keppra to your medication list. What else can I add for you?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nCan you add Lamotrigine?\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nI've added Lamotrigine to your medication list. What other items do you? Want to end them? \n00:13:19 Speaker 2\nNone.\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:13:30 Speaker 2\nI did it, added my medicine.\n00:13:31 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nAnd even though there's some some other stuff they added to like like last time I added Tylenol and Pepto Bismol.\n00:13:43 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yeah. So you're just able to add to it. Very good.\n00:13:47 Speaker 2\nYeah, they say making marks like print, yeah.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nAnd then, uh, Speaker 2, would you continue to add to the medication list? Uh. I mean, would you like, as you know, the weeks go on not right now, but.\n00:14:07 Speaker 2\nYeah, like, well, if maybe my my neurologist puts you on a different medicine, I would have to change them out. And maybe I go on like. Maybe I'll switch from Tylenol to Advil and switch it up.\n00:14:22 Speaker 1\nUp. Yeah, I like that.\n00:14:26 Speaker 2\nSome people, some people like, really have a big choice and it's like. They feel good to me.\n00:14:33 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yes. I like that. Yeah, you're just just making it like up to date and current. Yeah.\n00:14:47 Speaker 2\nSometimes like, either my pharmacy wants to switch it up or my my neuro psych my I have a neurologist and a neuro psych. Sometimes they give me. Kind of a different list like what time do you go to my pharmacy? I have to get them both.\n00:15:07 Speaker 3\nThat's true.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nAnd then. OK, I think we're pretty much done. OK. Unless there's anything I'm missing.\n00:15:24 Speaker 4\nGenevieve, I don't. I'm lucky. I don't think so. I think that was. That was. Ohh, I was gonna ask so you said that your neurologist was changing up your medications, so.\n00:15:44 Speaker 2\nYeah, he was like it. Kind of like stepping down the amount of one pill and making the other one go up because it hadn't phase out one that was on early in my recovery. Now putting me more of one newer pill. I'm switching them out right now.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nSo you mentioned that you were maybe gonna change use Speaker 3 to change the reminders.\n00:16:10 Speaker 2\nYeah. Because like my dosage of this pill called Keppra is going down my pill range for this lamotrigine is going up so that he's going facing. Now one in yeah.\n00:16:24 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah.\n00:16:27 Speaker 1\nVery nice. OK. Yeah.\n00:16:35 Speaker 2\nLet's.\n00:16:35 Speaker 1\nSee. I think I wonder if others are. Done. If should we go to the main room and just wait for the rest of the groups?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 2, did you used to actually surf or do you just watch it?\n00:17:08 Speaker 2\nUmm well, like before my accident. I am. I would like you know when you surf. I would get the little ones like down in Doheny or the little ways, like two or two feet like little ones. And just like, ride them to shore. It's really easy, but it's fun.\n00:17:29 Speaker 1\nThat's. Looks awesome. Ohh yeah Bolsa Chica. I've heard of that beach. It's quite famous.\n00:17:34 Speaker 2\nIt's it's, it's famous and also like Bohemia's famous too. They're both name beaches, but they're like easy to access and they're off right off PCH. Yeah.\n00:17:37 Speaker 1\nYeah. Ohh. Nice. Yeah, that's really cool. Speaker 2, do you still like to go to the beach on your off days?\n00:17:59 Speaker 2\nWell, sometimes like. My my friends, the State Guard and sometimes she I'm trying to get reintroduced. Being in the water like she in the past, she would tell me to swim with her from tower to Tower. But like I'm just kind of I'm reintroduce myself to water cause like earlier this year at UM, some seizures, so when you go back in the waves do not want to have that happen. So, like need to reintroduce myself. That's why I'm in my community pool, doing some either treading water or trying to do some little half laps. So it's all in like working my head need to make it. Work.\n00:18:44 Speaker 1\nYes, you will definitely, yeah.\n00:18:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, I want to push myself.\n00:18:48 Speaker 1\nYeah. Has Speaker 3 been pretty good at reminding you about your physical therapy appointment?\n00:18:54 Speaker 2\nYes, because I have her one of my one of my alarms is I want to have I set it for like different days of the week. My PT's are always on Wednesday, so she has alarm for. Time to go and reminder like 20 minutes before so you know your PT outfit is different than just they hang out. Alpha is like my PT. My clinician is or my PT doctor said he knew where leg and stretch you out so. To change.\n00:19:26 Speaker 1\nOhh wow yeah. That's good. And then you have enough time to, like, put your hair up and.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nBecause like well before PT, I need to have it in a bun or back cause like. One of the things well, I'm tall and also I got a lot of hair. So like sometimes my my PT, he\u2019s like you need to tie that back.\n00:19:53 Speaker 1\nSo they tell you.\n00:19:54 Speaker 2\nYeah, like UM. They're like, that's their job, physical therapy? They need to stretch me out, and if this is in the way we need to put it back.\n00:20:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense, yeah. All right, so I think. We are going to close the breakout rooms in a second, so we'll meet each other back.\n00:20:17 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:20:32 Speaker 1\nAnd I'm excited to get to well, we're going to come back in our breakout rooms, but I'm excited for towards the end asking Speaker 3 and Speaker 2 having you ask Speaker 3 some of these questions that you were curious about. So.\n00:20:56 Speaker 4\nIs it gonna automatically? Close or do we need to leave?\n00:21:01 Speaker 1\nOh, oh, there we go.\n00:21:02 Speaker 2\nMy phone to me now.\n00:21:03 Speaker 1\nYes. All right. I'll see you back there.\n00:21:06 Speaker 2\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:21:19 Speaker 4\nHi. Hi.\n00:21:22 Speaker 2\nHi guys again.\n00:21:24 Speaker 1\nHello. OK, I will share my screen again and then. We can continue. All right, Speaker 2, do you see the screen?\n00:21:38 Speaker 2\nAs I can this is 2 commands. The person says her name start flash briefing.\n00:21:45\nMHM.\n00:21:46 Speaker 2\nThen second one stop. OK. So do you want me to ask it?\n00:21:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, yes. Yeah. Go ahead. Actually, I can play it on a slideshow. So you can do that one first and then Yep.\n00:22:01 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Start flash briefing.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:22:21 Speaker 2\nWright brothers.\n00:22:27 Speaker 3\nFrom Post reports.\n00:22:31 Speaker 3\nAs you've probably heard us talk about on the show, The Washington Post has a big team covering the Paris Olympics. They're following all the highlights and what's happening behind the scenes.\n00:22:43 Speaker 2\nThey just switched me over to like, like no news about the Paris Olympics. Going on right now.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nOhh very cool. Yeah, so it didn't. It didn't keep on going and going.\n00:22:55 Speaker 2\nNo, I just like just switching out right away, yeah.\n00:22:57 Speaker 1\nWith this thought. Oh, wow. OK, so you don't have to say stop because.\n00:23:02 Speaker 2\nNo, it's they kept on going. But I'm saying as long.\n00:23:08 Speaker 1\nOhh so did you stop it?\n00:23:09 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, hit the little stop button because it said it said 27 minutes. I'm not gonna wait.\n00:23:17 Speaker 1\nWow. OK, very good, very good. OK, let's go on to the next one then. OK, so this one is kind of like knowing what's going on in your own personal calendar. So, Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try this one?\n00:23:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what's on my calendar?\n00:23:46 Speaker 3\nThere's nothing scheduled for the next 30 days.\n00:23:51 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:23:52 Speaker 2\nAnd I haven't had to restart it, so it's like it says yes. Yeah, you need to re put them in here after, after, right after our session to update it for next week.\n00:24:07 Speaker 1\nSo if there's nothing on your calendar, do you want to try making an event for something?\n00:24:12 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Speaker 3, can you make an event for tomorrow morning at 11:00 AM?\n00:24:26 Speaker 3\nOK. And what's the name of the event?\n00:24:29 Speaker 2\nSaint Jude's therapy network.\n00:24:32 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:24:39 Speaker 2\nShe just added something to my calendar.\n00:24:41 Speaker 1\nNice success. Are there any? Are there any other events that that you want to add to Speaker 3?\n00:24:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's.\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:25:06 Speaker 3\nAnd one way that I've been keeping up on. All of it is. By listening to the posts pop up.\n00:25:12 Speaker 2\nThe poses kept on going. Maybe we can add some more events to my calendar.\n00:25:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, let's try one more.\n00:25:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, can I have? Can I schedule an event for Monday morning? Hey.\n00:25:43 Speaker 3\nMonday and time.\n00:25:45 Speaker 2\nMonday morning at 11:00 AM. Doctor.\n00:25:48 Speaker 3\nAnd the name of the event.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nDoctor Bellucci meeting.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:25:57 Speaker 2\nYeah. So it's on here.\n00:25:59 Speaker 1\nYay. OK, now Speaker 2, can you ask what's on my calendar? And let's see if Speaker 3. OK, fine.\n00:26:09 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what's on my calendar?\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nHere are your next two events. Tomorrow at 11:00 AM, there's Saint Jude's therapy network. On Monday, August 12th, at 11:00 AM, there's doctor Bellucci.\n00:26:31 Speaker 1\nNice six of this.\n00:26:32 Speaker 2\nBut it's like, you know, coming out like those are my most current appointments here.\n00:26:39 Speaker 1\nExactly. Yeah, I'm glad. OK. She is responding. Yes, very up to date. Awesome. OK, Genevieve, go ahead and and kind of take over.\n00:26:43 Speaker 2\nUp to date right now.\n00:26:56 Speaker 4\nSure. Umm. So let's look at some uh news. So can you read the command?\n00:27:03 Speaker 2\nOK, it says her name. Who is running for president? Who was running for president to ask her?\n00:27:14 Speaker 4\nYeah. So you can go ahead and ask her this.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'll do this training, OK. Speaker 3, who is running for president.\n00:27:26 Speaker 3\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior. Jill Stein, Cornell West and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:27:56 Speaker 2\nThat was kind of up to date.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nI do not know that did.\n00:27:57 Speaker 4\nYeah. I didn't even know that. Did you know about Speaker 2?\n00:28:02 Speaker 1\nVery cool.\n00:28:06 Speaker 2\nWell, like I heard about like the top two, like Kamala and Trump. And then like, I learned about. RFK Junior and then. They're only those three, but there's some other ones there's learn about right now.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nCast this moment hosted by my colleague Eva Wall.\n00:28:25 Speaker 4\nThat's great.\n00:28:31 Speaker 1\nAlright, OK, next is. MHM.\n00:28:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Do you want me to ask her?\n00:28:43 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah, let's go ahead. So you can ask Speaker 3 about, yeah, just like current events.\n00:28:51 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. When is the election?\n00:28:57 Speaker 3\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:29:14 Speaker 2\nIt's OK. It's like well, it's November 5th. That's in like three months.\n00:29:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.\n00:29:27 Speaker 2\nBut like, you know, usually like the two months before, it's like everywhere. And the news is like this, this.\n00:29:36 Speaker 4\nDo you? Do you have any? Like follow up questions that would be related to the election?\n00:29:45 Speaker 3\nOn today's episode of the Sports moments, David.\n00:29:49 Speaker 2\nI would just probably ask. Maybe the local election questions like in California, like who's gonna be the governor or something like that.\n00:30:00 Speaker 4\nOK, you want to try asking her that?\n00:30:07 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Who is running for Governor of California?\n00:30:15 Speaker 3\nThe candidates in the 2022 California election for governor were Gavin Newsom and Brian Dahl.\n00:30:24 Speaker 2\nOhh, there's two guys running for it, you know. They knew some of this other guy.\n00:30:31 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:30:33 Speaker 2\nSome guy called Brian Brian Dahl learned about it today.\n00:30:41 Speaker 4\nDo you know anything about them? Either of them?\n00:30:45 Speaker 2\nWell, like Gavin Newsom was our previous governor, he's like going to be running again, and this this other guy and put him in the Internet too, happens.\n00:30:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:30:57 Speaker 4\nSo you could put it in the Internet, or you could even ask. More questions maybe if you're not sure what you're going to vote.\n00:31:06 Speaker 3\nDan Zac, who was covering the.\n00:31:09 Speaker 2\nI could just ask her and. That's why that guy.\n00:31:16 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:31:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Should we go on to the next one? That was great.\n00:31:29 Speaker 1\nAlright, let's ask this, OK.\n00:31:37 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is interesting now?\n00:31:46 Speaker 3\nWelcome to what's interesting now. Each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Irvine from Los Angeles Times.\n00:32:03 Speaker 3\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig in Tahiti resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his surfing correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:32:21 Speaker 3\nFrom Los Angeles.\n00:32:22 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:32:23 Speaker 3\nThe British rock icon rock.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nThey're just doing on different news articles about.\n00:32:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you can tell Speaker 3 to stop anytime. Or. Yeah. Yeah, I think you just click.\n00:32:36 Speaker 2\nAre you just hit the little pause? Yeah, they're just right now. They were just going to, you know, the old Rod Stewart was like.\n00:32:38 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:32:45 Speaker 2\nI'm not old for that. Yeah. Because it says that Rod Stewart is.\n00:32:57 Speaker 3\nA cultural event.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nNow his biggest relevancy is his illness. Learned about that today.\n00:33:10 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2, there is another command that I can. Sorry, excuse me. There's another command that I can kind of. Teach you it's uh, I think it's like Speaker 3, what's the story? And do you want to try that? I don't know if it'll give you if that also is a skill that might give you some stories or I don't know how it's going to respond, but do you want? To try that one.\n00:33:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what is the story?\n00:33:48 Speaker 3\nA narrative story or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional or fictional.\n00:34:00 Speaker 1\nOK, sorry, I think I think.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nYeah, but. A different word.\n00:34:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, when I. Speaker 3 sometimes prompts can prompt you, so if she's talking about a certain news like headline, yeah, you can ask. What's the story? And then she'll kind of elaborate more on it.\n00:34:23 Speaker 2\nMore detail, OK.\n00:34:24 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So I think that's when it will be appropriate to use that one. Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right, let's go on to. The next one, no. All right. Sorry. Go ahead. Send a beep. OK.\n00:34:43 Speaker 4\nOK. So yeah, we can kind of see what it's like in your area or even like how we did in the other you can, you know, ask this question or ask for different areas. But why don't we start by trying this command?\n00:35:01 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'm asking. Speaker 3. What's the traffic like?\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:35:18 Speaker 2\nWell, she wants my work address.\n00:35:20 Speaker 3\nOK, currently, traffic on your commute looks good. The fastest route takes about one minute via Sierra Cello Rd.\n00:35:48 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah my work and where I am now is the same place. It's it's one minute comes.\n00:36:00 Speaker 4\nAnother thing that you could ask like when I used to drive in commute, I would drive on the 5 freeway, would even ask what's the traffic like on the 5 freeway or another freeway that you take a lot.\n00:36:16 Speaker 2\nAlright so. I'm gonna ask her, OK? Speaker 3, what is the traffic on the 405 freeway right now?\n00:36:28 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:33 Speaker 2\nOK, Speaker 3. What's the traffic like on the 405 freeway?\n00:36:41 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:46 Speaker 4\nI don't think she likes that command.\n00:36:48 Speaker 2\nNo, but like I live closer to the 405 than the five, but.\n00:36:54 Speaker 4\nYeah, maybe we could, I can look and see if I can figure out how. To reword it to ask about that, maybe next time.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, probably next time.\n00:37:07 Speaker 4\nLet's see. OK. All right, so this one, you can kind of look into some exercises, so let's try asking about this exercise.\n00:37:23 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK. Speaker 3. What are exercises for lower back pain?\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHere's something I found on reference.com partial crunches. Hamstring stretches, walls sits and bridging are four exercises that can improve lower back pain dot regular weight lifting and aerobic exercise such as walking, biking or running are also helpful. But people should stop these exercises if they cause any pain. For people who experience.\n00:38:06 Speaker 2\nShe listed, she listed it off. A good list of things like, you know, your lower back is like a big. Part of it, yeah, overall health. So you were standing up straight is always good.\n00:38:20 Speaker 4\nYeah. And you could even try this with, you know, other pain that you get too. Like, if you get pain in you know your neck or something like that. You could you could. Try that as well.\n00:38:31 Speaker 2\nAsk her for that. Yeah, because, like sometimes. Like my like the size of my neck scent is. My PT my PT says you're stiff. You stretch it out.\n00:38:46 Speaker 4\nYeah. All right, let's try one more.\n00:38:54 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:38:58 Speaker 4\nOK, so why don't you go ahead and ask this one?\n00:39:07 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:39:14 Speaker 3\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 3 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:39:32 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, you know this town, Olympia, maybe it's a real place.\n00:39:40 Speaker 1\nIt probably is, yeah.\n00:39:42 Speaker 2\nOver there.\n00:39:45 Speaker 1\nUh, this is actually a good segway. Speaker 2, do you want to ask a couple questions that you were actually genuinely curious about? Like the questions you were telling us earlier?\n00:39:58 Speaker 2\nRight.\n00:39:59 Speaker 1\nSo I yeah, I think they were. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sure you have them. It was about break dancing teams or like the other. The Surf, surf, athletes, anything that comes to mind.\n00:40:14 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. Who are the US Olympic female surfers?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nFrom surfacefootprint.com. The Olympic medal favorites in the male surfing event are John John Florence and Kolohe Andino, and the Olympic medal favorites in the female surfing event are Carissa Moon and Caroline Marks from the USA.\n00:40:46 Speaker 2\nWell, they gave me an overall answer, but the girls were on there like Caroline and this other girl. So even though the list of the boys too is like I know them.\n00:40:59 Speaker 4\nNow that's great.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nVery good. \n00:41:07 Speaker 2\nYeah. It's good for me.  It's like I hear them again, like if I'm in my room at night. She says something though. Need to be up to date.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nPlease have fun. Alright, so we are. Yeah, we're going to go back to the main room, but great job today. Speaker 2. I think I learned a lot.\n00:41:24 Speaker 2\nWe are all learning.\n00:41:29 Speaker 1\nThanks for your questions. Yeah.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** R.T.  \n**Date:** 08-08-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses a desire to utilize their Alexa device (Speaker 3) for accessing news and scheduling reminders.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nR.T. is a [age not specified] year-old [gender not specified] who is currently using an Alexa device to assist with scheduling and accessing information.

The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-01-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Breakout room training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Clinician\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient F.W.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Patient L.V.G.\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nRecording. So we're gonna go over some questions related to self-care and medical needs today. So first of all, though, we're going to do a little review of the last week's comments. So you're going to show me how you can play music, play music, or a video of your choice with your Speaker 4 device. So you want to go ahead and do that? Speaker 2, do you want to give it a command?\n00:00:37 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you play? A video from. January 3rd. OK.\n00:00:56 Speaker 1\nDoes it? Is it playing anything?\n00:00:58 Speaker 3\nYes it is.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:01:00 Speaker 3\nI hooked up Speaker 2's apple music. To the elect. Don't ask me how I did it, but. I figured it out. OK. We did hook it up and he's been able. He's been using that feature a lot, he'll say, play Bon Jovi or and it will just start playing a. Yeah. Bunch of Bon Jovi songs.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK. So when?\n00:01:27 Speaker 3\nBut I do have a question.\n00:01:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, go ahead. Yeah.\n00:01:31 Speaker 3\nThat just turn it off, Speaker 2.\n00:01:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:38 Speaker 3\nLouder.\n00:01:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:01:42 Speaker 3\nIt's muted. That's fine.\n00:01:43 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:48 Speaker 3\nIn in relation to the music, Speaker 2 listens to a radio station in the mornings. It's a KC 790.\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nUh-huh.\n00:01:59 Speaker 3\nSo is there a way to hook that up as well?\n00:02:04 Speaker 1\nThere should be actually.\n00:02:08 Speaker 3\nAnd if not, I believe the show he listens to is on that iheart app. So I don't, I do, we don't have that either, but I those are that was part part one and we could hook it up then it would be the same way. Part 2 is Speaker 2 gets books from. Guard. Which is for from Berlin Institute their books. It's a reading library and you choose your books on Bard and then you can play. Listen to your books. Is it possible to hook that up to Speaker 4 or should it just be YouTube? On YouTube you can actually listen to all kinds of stories as well.\n00:02:51 Speaker 1\nRight, so I'm pretty. Sure that the audible, I I don't know if you know there's a there's a website called Audible which has audible books. I'm pretty sure that can be hooked up to Speaker 4. I am not very sure about about the board. OK. But I can check and let you know about that one. Yeah, I I can research a little bit and maybe maybe get back to you is it called Bard Bard.\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOhh OK. Correct. OK. It's rail institute.\n00:03:25 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK, alright, let me check I I almost wonder if if it could be. Synced into your phone. And because your phones Speaker 4 is synced in with the Speaker 4 on the Echo. So if it could be played on the phone, it could be played on here, but I will check and let.\n00:03:44 Speaker 4\nUh-huh.\n00:03:51 Speaker 1\nYou know for sure.\n00:03:52 Speaker 3\nOK. And just so you know, I put the Bard app is on his iPad and I put the Speaker 4 app on the iPad.\n00:03:58 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nAnd they're both and. The pad is linked to the.\n00:04:02 Speaker 1\nPhone, phone. Perfect. So, alright. OK. I can. I can look that up for sure. One was the Bard and then other one was the.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nOh.\n00:04:11 Speaker 1\nMusic. You said. No. What? What was that?\n00:04:13 Speaker 3\nAt the radio station, it's OK.\n00:04:15 Speaker 1\nRadio station about yes.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nAt K ABC 790 OK Yeah 790.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nABC.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAll right. So all right, those are very specific questions, so.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nI didn't. Well, we're we're trying.\n00:04:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, no, that's perfect. But so Speaker 2, I had a question. So when you said Speaker 4 play a video from January 3rd, what did it bring up? Did it, was it anything specific that what what did was that the command that he that you gave?\n00:04:48 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what command did you give?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nJust command.\n00:04:53 Speaker 3\nCan you repeat it? Yeah. What was it?\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nYou like to play. New memory from January 3rd.\n00:05:03 Speaker 3\nA memory from January.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\n3rd memory OK, play a memory from OK. So did it. What did it bring up? I'm just curious.\n00:05:14 Speaker 3\nIt did. It was a video and then the music started playing.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nFor you.\n00:05:20 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK. All right, but. Very nice, Speaker 2. I mean, I'm, I'm so impressed. All right, so.\n00:05:31 Speaker 4\nThat for you.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:05:34 Speaker 1\nAll right, perfect. All right, Speaker 2. So let's move over to this week's topic. What type? So I have a few questions I want to ask you. First, initially to 1st ASK is is like what is your goal when it comes to self-care and medical needs? Using Speaker 4, what would you say your goal is?\n00:06:02 Speaker 3\nFor health and medical needs, Speaker 2 to use Speaker 4.\n00:06:04 Speaker 2\nHow's the mass on each? Here. Brushing my teeth.\n00:06:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright. What did you what? What else did you say?\n00:06:23 Speaker 3\nTrimming his nails.\n00:06:25 Speaker 1\nOK, trimming the nails. Perfect. Alright. Anything else you can think of?\n00:06:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, eating breakfast.\n00:06:36 Speaker 1\nCorrect. So eating meals on time?\n00:06:39 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:06:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n00:07:07 Speaker 3\nAre you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:07:16 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n00:07:40 Speaker 2\nMy iPhone.\n00:07:42 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n00:07:56 Speaker 3\nAre you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n00:08:00 Speaker 2\nMaking reminders on the iPhone.\n00:08:04 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nSo OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n00:08:50 Speaker 3\nIf I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n00:09:06 Speaker 1\nGot it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n00:10:11 Speaker 2\nSo I can. Make goals.\n00:10:17 Speaker 3\nMake goals.\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:21 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n00:11:00 Speaker 3\nWould you like her to remind you?\n00:11:04 Speaker 3\nTo eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n00:11:12 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:11:15 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nBrushing my teeth.\n00:11:37 Speaker 3\nBrushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n00:11:40 Speaker 1\nAll right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n00:12:13 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n00:12:27 Speaker 1\nYours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nThe same right? And that makes like more.\n00:12:49 Speaker 1\nYou think of that, Speaker 2?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nThat's a good idea.\n00:12:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n00:13:59 Speaker 3\nFair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n00:14:13 Speaker 4\nMHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nThat'd be good. OK.\n00:14:21 Speaker 3\nBecause I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n00:14:31 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:14:31 Speaker 3\nWould be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n00:14:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n00:14:54 Speaker 3\nOK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n00:15:09 Speaker 1\nUh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n00:15:12 Speaker 3\nA barred book is what I'm thinking.\n00:15:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n00:15:25 Speaker 3\nOh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n00:15:42 Speaker 1\nYou know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n00:16:19 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n00:16:21 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n00:16:40 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:16:42 Speaker 1\nI almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n00:16:46 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:16:47 Speaker 1\nThe device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n00:16:50 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:17:08 Speaker 1\nBecause there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n00:17:19 Speaker 3\nWell, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n00:17:26 Speaker 1\nThat's all.\n00:17:31 Speaker 3\nFeel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n00:17:35 Speaker 1\nThat would be great.\n00:17:35 Speaker 3\nCould behind.\n00:17:38 Speaker 1\nThat would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n00:17:44 Speaker 3\nOK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n00:17:52 Speaker 1\nOhh OK Speaker 2.\n00:17:57 Speaker 3\nThey were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n00:18:05 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:18:08 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:18:08 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:18:11 Speaker 3\nThere. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n00:18:15 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:18:16 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n00:18:41 Speaker 1\nYeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n00:18:49 Speaker 3\nBut an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n00:18:53 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:18:55 Speaker 3\nDo I just say to open the bar app?\n00:18:59 Speaker 1\nYeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n00:19:03 Speaker 3\nOK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n00:19:25 Speaker 1\nNo, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n00:19:57 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nSearching for the.\n00:20:04 Speaker 3\nBard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n00:20:12 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:20:14 Speaker 4\nCouncil.\n00:20:15 Speaker 1\nIs there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n00:21:05 Speaker 4\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n00:21:08 Speaker 3\nOK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n00:21:18 Speaker 4\nSearching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n00:21:19 Speaker 3\nIt's not understanding the bars.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nThat's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n00:21:26 Speaker 3\nMaybe yeah.\n00:21:29 Speaker 1\nAnother another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n00:21:59 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:02 Speaker 1\nTo.\n00:22:04 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n00:22:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n00:22:25 Speaker 3\nNope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nIs Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n00:22:46 Speaker 3\nNo, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nIt's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n00:22:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nIt's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n00:23:15 Speaker 3\nI'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n00:23:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n00:23:48 Speaker 4\nMy.\n00:23:52 Speaker 1\nAlright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n00:24:20 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:24:21 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n00:24:46 Speaker 3\nThe breakout room.\n00:24:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:24:48 Speaker 3\nOK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n00:24:51 Speaker 1\nAbsolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- \nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 2.\n00:25:10 Speaker 2\nHey, what's up?\n00:25:12 Speaker 1\nAlright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n00:25:50 Speaker 3\nUnmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n00:26:07 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:26:11 Speaker 3\nOK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n00:26:12 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Could.\n00:26:21 Speaker 1\nOK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:28 Speaker 2\nOK. Thank you.\n00:26:30 Speaker 3\nGo ahead.\n00:26:31 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:44 Speaker 4\nI've checked off oranges from medication.\n00:26:47 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:26:49 Speaker 1\nOhh did it say check off?\n00:26:49 Speaker 3\nAnd. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n00:26:55 Speaker 1\nNo longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n00:27:25 Speaker 2\nIbuprofen.\n00:27:27 Speaker 1\nOK, well you have been.\n00:27:28 Speaker 3\nWhat's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n00:27:38 Speaker 2\nTypical.\n00:27:39 Speaker 3\nOK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n00:27:42 Speaker 2\nEvery day.\n00:27:43 Speaker 3\nAt what time? In the morning it's at.\n00:27:53 Speaker 2\n7:30.\n00:27:55 Speaker 3\nOK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n00:28:00 Speaker 1\nOK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n00:28:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n00:28:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n00:28:22 Speaker 3\n10.\n00:28:23 Speaker 1\n7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to take Depakote at 7:30 AM tomorrow.\n00:28:42 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:47 Speaker 1\nOK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n00:29:09 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:29:10 Speaker 1\nOK, let's do that command.\n00:29:15 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n00:29:31 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n00:29:36 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n00:30:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:30:29 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away on Canyon Way, right? A 1.4 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite 110, Walgreens 2.3 miles away on Haven Ave. you can ask me for things like what's the phone number for the first one?\n00:30:51 Speaker 1\nOK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n00:31:04 Speaker 3\nIf that makes sense.\n00:31:07 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n00:31:49 Speaker 3\nJust so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nRight, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n00:32:08 Speaker 3\nJust so you. You had a heads up and. So you you know what?\n00:32:13 Speaker 1\nI mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n00:32:45 Speaker 3\nHe didn't.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I do my laundry?\n00:32:59 Speaker 1\nDid it pick it up?\n00:33:01 Speaker 3\nIt it's showing it's. A video and pictures and a lot of words on how to do it. Let me just make sure the volumes up, yeah, the volumes 3/4.\n00:33:14 Speaker 1\nOh, OK.\n00:33:16 Speaker 3\nIt picked it up but it. I don't know if my cord. Will reach the camera.\n00:33:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Is it is it more visual? Maybe like rather than ohh it's like a very text. It's all.\n00:33:30 Speaker 3\nIt's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n00:33:36 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n00:33:59 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Give me the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:12 Speaker 3\nIt's doing the same thing, the same thing. Try tell me how to do laundry that way you're telling her to? Read it to. You.\n00:34:21 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:34:22 Speaker 3\nSorry again, Speaker 2.\n00:34:25 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Hey, Speaker 4. Tell me how to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:40 Speaker 3\nIt's written again. It's written again. OK, OK, directions. Speaker 2.\n00:34:50 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me the directions to do my laundry.\n00:34:58 Speaker 4\nAt the moment, traffic to vineyards marketplace cleaners at 11460 Canyon Way looks pretty clear.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nOhh it's giving like.\n00:35:05 Speaker 4\nJust about 3 minutes via Canyon with her place.\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's a.\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nYeah. It's like a laundromat. Probably gets. Right. OK, alright. Alright, let's try another one. OK, let's try this set reminder to do laundry. Maybe that's a function more functional one. I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n00:35:54 Speaker 2\nM. OK.\n00:35:57 Speaker 3\nGo.\n00:35:58 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to. Do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:05 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:36:07 Speaker 2\nTo do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:11 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:36:12 Speaker 2\nTomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:20 Speaker 4\nIs that 5:00? In the morning or in the afternoon.\n00:36:22 Speaker 2\nIn the afternoon.\n00:36:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.\n00:36:32 Speaker 1\nBye. Purpose. OK, good job. Does these kind of reminders help Speaker 2? Maybe. That would be more functional in the real life, you think.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 1\nAlright, yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. When I asked Speaker 2, I was cooking and I asked him to set the timer for me and that was very optional. Yes.\n00:36:57 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, that is great.\n00:37:01 Speaker 3\nAnd she even told. Speaker 4, to set my mom at the time.\n00:37:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. So. OK. OK. All right, so getting stains out of clothes. What else?\n00:37:19 Speaker 3\nOK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n00:37:21 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n00:37:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:37:44 Speaker 3\nWhat?\n00:37:44 Speaker 2\nWhat do I use to get a stain out of my clothes?\n00:37:52 Speaker 4\nTo remove stains from clothes, rinse the stain with cold water and scrub it with the brush and soap. If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in cold water and soak for an hour. Then wash the clothing as usual.\n00:38:06 Speaker 3\nThis one showed the words in paragraph as well as Reddit.\n00:38:11 Speaker 1\nThat's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n00:38:18 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:38:37 Speaker 1\nText. But. I almost wonder for the laundry part. If we'd ask her to give me the first step to do my laundry or something like that.\n00:38:51 Speaker 3\nYeah. Try that, Speaker 2.\n00:38:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you give me the first step to do my laundry?\n00:39:06 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:39:08 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n00:39:41 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:39:41 Speaker 3\nI think that was the paragraph that she didn't read before.\n00:39:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, but it read. It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n00:40:20 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:40:24 Speaker 1\nDo you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n00:40:48 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. When do I use the fabric softener?\n00:40:57 Speaker 4\nAccording to an Speaker 4 Answers contributor. Add fabric softener to the wash during the rinse cycle.\n00:41:05 Speaker 1\nOK. All right.\n00:41:08 Speaker 3\nMakes sense?\n00:41:09 Speaker 1\nOK, I think this is pretty functional here. So Speaker 2 say that you have a headache and you need some answers on how to treat it on your own. So you're going to say the wake word and say, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:32 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:42 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for a migraine include applying ice packs to the back of the neck, forehead or temples, taking a nap, taking a warm shower or bath, massage, drinking water resting in a low lit room, or physical therapy.\n00:42:00 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. OK. All right, let's do the same for stomach pains. OK, so say you have a sudden stomach pain and you want to know what remedies you can use. So you're going to say the wake word. And what do I take for stomach pains? Ready. Cool.\n00:42:27 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:35 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:42:38 Speaker 4\nHuh.\n00:42:40 Speaker 1\nInteresting. Let me try that one more time, OK. On mine, Speaker 4, mute. What do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:55 Speaker 4\nI don't know that one.\n00:42:58 Speaker 1\nIt says the same thing for me too.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nOh wow.\n00:43:02 Speaker 1\nYeah. So we'll have to try that one one more time.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n00:43:14 Speaker 1\nOK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n00:43:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:43:27 Speaker 1\nUh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:09 Speaker 3\nWhat kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:20 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. All Star physical therapy 3.1 miles away on Rochester Ave. Suite 110, team Physical therapy, 3 miles away on Town Center. Dr. Rancho San Antonio Rehab Center, 2.3 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite G30.\n00:44:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n00:45:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's.\n00:45:21 Speaker 2\nYeah it does.\n00:45:24 Speaker 1\nOK, I think we are through with the slides. Let me stop sharing my screen. OK. Any questions about anything we did today?\n00:45:37 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:45:38 Speaker 1\nNo. OK, how about you?\n00:45:40 Speaker 3\nMom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n00:45:51 Speaker 4\nHmm.\n00:45:53 Speaker 3\nI'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n00:45:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n00:46:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:46:49 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:49 Speaker 3\nYou know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n00:46:55 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:47:01 Speaker 3\nDo you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n00:47:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n00:47:40 Speaker 3\nSo I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:47:58 Speaker 4\nYou.\n00:47:59 Speaker 4\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n00:48:01 Speaker 1\nYeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n00:48:01 Speaker 3\nAnd it was.\n00:48:20 Speaker 1\nBecause once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n00:48:33 Speaker 3\nRight. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n00:48:55 Speaker 1\nYes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n00:50:15 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:50:16 Speaker 1\nError. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n00:50:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n00:50:32 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:50:33 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:50:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n00:50:44 Speaker 3\nOhh no, I think we're good, thank.\n00:50:45 Speaker 1\nYou OK? Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and I. Hey. Will get back to you, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:50:57 Speaker 4\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will be oh. I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slide a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So expect another homework for this week, self-care inform. Just just to double check that you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two, you got all the slides. I know, Speaker 6, you got it, Speaker 2, you got it. OK, Speaker 10, you got it too. Yeah. I need to do mine.\n00:51:40 Speaker 10\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n00:51:49 Speaker 4\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Speaker 9, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our part point training. So after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be anytime. But if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd, the so think week six. If you go by numbers in. Your head.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:52:42 Speaker 4\nWeek 6 we would like to hear from you. Just we were asking some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well, you can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share. Together, because chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel, feel free to bring them as well. And I'll send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n00:53:31 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:53:33 Speaker 4\nAny questions?\n00:53:34 Speaker 5\nSorry. Speaker 6, we we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 6, if you still want to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and. Then we'll let. You go, I promise. Sounds good. OK. OK.\n00:53:47 Speaker 4\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can debrief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday.\n00:54:04 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:54:07 Speaker 4\nAll right, Speaker 6, I'm going to open the breakout room. OK. Uh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 6 and Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 can go. And don't forget to record. OK.\n00:54:21 Speaker 2\nYou want me to join or not?\n00:54:23 Speaker 4\nYes, Speaker 6, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going. To change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Gina.\n00:54:44 Speaker 4\nYay, great job.\n00:54:47 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:54:48 Speaker 5\nDid you see?\n00:54:48 Speaker 4\nThe stop recording or who is recording now just telling. Oh yeah, there it is. OK. Oh my goodness. You did. It's amazing job. Gina, I just love how you provided so many solutions on the spot. I was like, this is how a well versed trainer who knows her system can do because there were some of those. I'm like, well, you know. What I don't know, he can do. Like like I can do it. So I was literally like, I'm learning from Tina because I haven't explored. Those. List function. It's super helpful.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities.

I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes.

Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah.

And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 (Week 2) R.T.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- **Patient Name:** R.T.\n- **Date:** 07-25-2024\n- **Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n- **Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses interest in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  \n- **History of Present Illness (HPI):** \n  - R.T. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who enjoys various forms of entertainment, including movies, music, and games. \n  - R.T. reports a preference for watching trending movies and enjoys the experience of going to theaters, particularly for comedies. \n  - R.T. uses a laptop and cell phone for entertainment, frequently accessing YouTube for music and social media to connect with friends. \n  - R.T. has a Spotify account for music streaming and enjoys listening to old folk and rock music while working on tasks that require concentration, such as typing for a laboratory license renewal.\n  - R.T. also enjoys watching shows like \"Wipeout\" and \"American Ninja Warrior\" for their competitive nature.\n  \n- **Current Medications:** None reported.\n  \n- **Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n- **Vital Signs:** Not assessed during the session.\n  \n- **Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Laboratory Data:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Imaging Results:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Other Diagnostic Data:** \n  - R.T. demonstrated the ability to set reminders and alarms using the voice-activated device (Speaker 15).\n  - R.T. successfully connected to Spotify and YouTube for music and video playback.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Problem 1:** Difficulty in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n    - Lack of familiarity with voice-activated technology.\n    - Potential cognitive overload when managing multiple applications.\n  - **Discussion:** R.T. shows enthusiasm for using technology but may benefit from further guidance on maximizing its use for entertainment and reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Education and Training:**\n   - Continue to provide R.T. with practical demonstrations on how to use Speaker 15 for various entertainment functions, including setting reminders, playing music, and accessing videos.\n   - Encourage R.T. to create playlists on Spotify and explore YouTube for content that aligns with their interests.\n\n2. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess R.T.'s comfort level with the technology and address any challenges faced in using the device for entertainment.\n   - Encourage R.T. to practice using the device independently and report back on their experiences.\n\n3. **Patient Engagement:**\n   - Suggest R.T. explore new genres of music or shows to enhance their entertainment experience.\n   - Recommend R.T. to engage with family members or friends to share experiences and learn together about using the technology.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- R.T. appears motivated to learn and utilize technology for entertainment, indicating a positive outlook on integrating these tools into daily life.

He  was  prompted  by  mom throughout the session when Alexa didn't pick up command.M.A. was cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. His mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.   Objective  (O):    Review  of  week  2  content  related  to  entertainment  was  completed  first.  M.A.  was  asked  to  play any music or video of his choice using his Echo device.  Practiced  commands:  \u201cAlexa,  play  a  video  from  January  3rd.\u201d  accurately  in  1/1  attempts.   -  His  mother  mentioned  syncing  his  Apple  music  account  to  the  Amazon  Echo  Device/Alexa account which made it possible for Alexa to access the content from his phone and in turn, was able to play a video from a specific date.  -  He  also  practiced  a  command  to  stop  the  video  or  music  (\u201cAlexa,  Stop\u201d)   that  was  playing in 1 out of 2 attempts needing mod cueing to unmute the device before executing this command.  His  mother  mentioned  that  MA  has  been  able  to  use  Alexa  for  playing  Bon  Jovi  songs  that  he likes to listen. His mother asked questions related to syncing a radio station to his Echo device and similarly was also interested in using the BARD library for blind app on his Echo device to improve his accessibility to the entertainment/books without assistance from his caregivers.   User  Needs  Assessment:   Interview  style  Q  and  A  completed  to  learn  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs  related  to  self  care  and medical needs.  -  MA  needs  assistance  with  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  such  as  washing  hair,  brushing teeth, trimming nails and eating breakfast -  He  depends  entirely  on  his  parents  for  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  except  for  sometimes setting reminders for various needs  Scenarios  for  using  Alexa  for  self-care  and  medical  needs:   Dosage  of  medication,  reminder  to  refill/reorder  medication,  reminders  to  have  breakfast  on  certain time, brushing teeth at a certain time, reading the medication list for morning routine/evening, checking off the medications that have been taken for that particular day.  MA  was  introduced  to  tactically  feel  the  button  for  mute  and  unmute  on  top  of  the  Echo  device for him to be able to improve his ability to use the device more independently.   Command  training/practice:   MA  practiced  17  commands  related  to  self-care  and  medical  needs.  He  executed  verbal  commands for creating a medication list, adding a medication (tylenol) to the created list, read the medication list back  (\u201cAlexa, read me my medication list\u201d), reminder for taking a specific medication (depocope) at a given time (\u201cAlexa, remind me to take decocope tomorrow at 7.30 am\u201d), reminder for doing laundry, steps on how to do the laundry in 1/1 attempts  using  the  verbal  prompts  and  modeling  provided  by  the  clinician  and  his  mother  both. He was also able to ask questions including where he could find tylenol, how to get stains out clothes, how to use a fabric softener, how to treat a migraine, what to take for stomach ache, and asking on how to find a physical therapist.    Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:   With  the  Q  and  A  style  interview  questions,  the  participant  continues  to  need  mod  to  max  cueing and scaffolding from his mother and clinicians to participate and elaborate on his subjective responses. For self care and medical needs, the participant is caregiver dependent and the use of Alexa would assist the participant in being independent with reminders for medications, asking questions regarding tasks related to this topic  The  participant  continued  to  demonstrate  progress  with  his  ability  to  execute  the  commands  this week given min to mod verbal prompting and cueing to be a louder and over articulate to ensure the ASR would recognize the command Given  MA  that  is  blind,  the  command  related  to  steps  or  instructions  to  do  laundry  was  the  one that was the most challenging. The Echo Show presented the written steps or instructions to complete laundry on the screen; however it wouldn\u2019t provide verbal output for the same. This required the clinician and his mother to prompt MA to execute different reworded commands to determine that the device was reading one step at a time to complete this task (laundry). The command that produced the desired results was \u201cAlexa, read me the instructions to do laundry one step at a time\u201d. Although, this command still yielded verbal output of all the steps at once instead of proving one step at a time. With the command \u201cwhat do I take for stomach pain?\u201d, the command was not processed and needed to be reworded to \u201cstomach ache\u201d   Plan  (P):   Participant  encouraged  to  talk  slower  and  over  articulate  with  complex  words  like  names  of  the medications etc to improve the ASR of the system.

MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes\u201d   \u201cAlexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  can  you  repeat?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes\u201d  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  check  off  gum\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese\u201d   \u201cRead  me  option  one\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  option  two\u201d  \u201cAlexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk\u201d  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what\u2019s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe\u201d  \u201cHey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?\u201d  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?\u201d   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance \u201cAlexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese\u201d led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command \u201c Alexa, read me option one\u201d led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA\u2019s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn\u2019t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  clear  my  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers\u201d   \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes.

M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?\u201d  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  \u201cTrazadone\u201d  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week\u2019s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. \u201cIs there a fact you would like to know?\u201d) M.A. practice the following commands: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?\u201d  -  \u201c Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cFor  the  gym\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?\u201d  -  \u201cAlexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?\u201d   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying \u201csuch as___\u201d to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.\u2019s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as \u201cWho do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?\u201d  and  \u201cIs  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?\u201d.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands.

The generated note should include similar details, specifying any assignments or strategies that will be implemented in future sessions to support the patient's progress.\n\n6. **Consistency in Sections:**\n   - Ensure that each section of the generated note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) is consistent with the target note in terms of content and focus. This includes maintaining a balance between technology use, medication management, and the patient's specific goals and interests.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving a closer alignment with the desired output.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-24 (Week 4) R.T.

Appointments.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nOK, very good. Alright, so have you been able to access the homework link OK. Or.\n00:00:18 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, umm the you. I have like e-mail thread from like the like. The Speaker 3 study and my e-mail. I just click it. Yeah. And I can put it, it goes up in my browser I can just type it.\n00:00:22 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:00:27 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, good. So you can, UM, I think there's some questions and then you can like record yourself.\n00:00:36 Speaker 2\nYeah, and take a video and submit.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yeah. I thought that was such a cool platform. I never worked with that. And I was like, wow, this. Is really.\n00:00:45 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:00:47 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK. Me. OK, so Speaker 2 today the topic is news and facts, so kind of talking about like asking Speaker 3 to schedule. You don't like turning on the news and telling us what's going on. Do you have any goals? In terms of. Using Speaker 3 for news and facts.\n00:01:21 Speaker 2\nIf there's like something important going on like the Olympics or like an election a couple weeks, like maybe I can ask her, like, how are the polls in California or something like that? Or I live in California, just like Orange County or something like that. And maybe, like, I can ask, like, who won the 100m? Dash to the Olympics like you know, people are like here say ohh Noah Lyles like. Like that guy? There's some other guys.\n00:01:51 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, I actually watched the documentary about Noah Lyles on Netflix, so I was, like, amazed. And then, yeah.\n00:01:59 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:02:02 Speaker 1\nDo you watch Netflix, Speaker 2?\n00:02:05 Speaker 2\nI think, well, my mom has, like, every different streaming. So like always has checked her here and there.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. There's so many Netflix documentaries now on the Olympic athletes like Simone Biles, and yeah, the sprinters and stuff. Awesome. OK. Genevieve, would you like to take it away? Is your needs OK? OK.\n00:02:31 Speaker 4\nSure. So also I was just writing in the goal and then it just got. Deleted. Oh, is it? I'm not sure. I think I just pressed something.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nAnd delete it. OK, maybe can you do undo and see if it comes back up?\n00:02:54\nIt's not.\n00:02:57 Speaker 4\nI can rewrite it.\n00:02:58 Speaker 1\nOhh that's OK I I. Got it you can proceed.\n00:03:02 Speaker 4\nOK. All right. So first we kind of you kind of just talked about it, but what type of information do you want to listen to the news floor?\n00:03:16 Speaker 2\nWell, if there's like, you know, a big event like, no, everyone's talking about or like you heard it on other platforms like social media or something. Ohh, what do you think about this Olympic racer or some kind of like running topic that, you know, sports or? Like something like, you know, people, you know, people don't wanna, like, talk about elections. But like, sometimes it comes in your head. You wanna talk about it? So maybe you can just like, maybe ask her something about like. Like you know, this year's Olympics, you may have break dancing. Maybe like we'll ask her, like, who's the women's break dancing for the US? I don't know how to.\n00:04:02 Speaker 4\nHey, that's awesome. I'm sorry. Dance.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nThe Champions? Yeah. Or maybe they're like, maybe like the athlete or whoever they want to do it, OK.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nAll right. And then what topics are you interested in discussing or learning more about, like there's cars or fishing or sports or health? Is there anything that you you wanna find out more about?\n00:04:36 Speaker 2\nWell, I like water sports, swimming and surfing.\n00:04:41 Speaker 4\nOK. Do you want to learn more about swimming and surfing? Is there anything else you want to learn more about?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nWell, like science are like recent science like.\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nLike news or like, you know, my background is in genetics like lab testing. So like you know there's like something called crisper. It's like like doing individual medicine by altering people's genes. So send this to some like the front page news. So it's like. Wow. Yeah, it's in there somewhere.\n00:05:23 Speaker 4\nSo you'd want us ask about it so that Speaker 3 could maybe expand on that. Yeah. So how would you ask that question?\n00:05:35 Speaker 2\nAlright, maybe make a call, say her name, and then say. I think. Are there not? Don't always say that I'm. Is there any news about gene editing currently or something like that?\n00:05:54 Speaker 4\nOK, great. Alright, yeah. I wish I knew more about that.\n00:06:06 Speaker 2\nI know like no. Currently there's some people who have, like, a family trait, like sickle cell anemia. They cut it as soon as they got, like, cut it out of the genome or some people they call, they get designer babies. They try to edit their baby when they when they're born they want like perfect, you know, types thing. Some people do that not me, but it's out there, right.\n00:06:36 Speaker 4\nOK. So can you think of 10 scenarios to complete the sentence? I want to ask or know more about?\n00:06:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:06:49 Speaker 4\nSo is there like 10 things you want to learn more about?\n00:06:55 Speaker 2\nI will. I want to learn more about the US break dancing team. Or Olympic break dancing team. And then maybe say. Who is the US athlete athlete in the 100m butterfly? And then. UM. Who is the? Female US Olympian in the 100 meter dash. It's running then. Are there is it? Are there any Olympic pair break break dancing? I didn't think it was this different categories and sports was like single and double so.\n00:08:02 Speaker 4\nYeah. Is there any non sports related things that you wanted to learn about?\n00:08:10 Speaker 2\nUM. Well, like you know, sometimes there's some stuff like. My son is on TV. That was like like. Well, sometimes is like a bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever's on TV. And like, they will see who it is now. It's like, it's like, want to talk about it? I'm just like, it's usually the same script, but just different guys.\n00:08:36 Speaker 4\nRight, yeah. Been up to date.\n00:08:40 Speaker 2\nYeah, she would like. Ohh. Like shows like that.\n00:08:46 Speaker 4\nOK. Anything else?\n00:08:55 Speaker 2\nMaybe I can ask her to. Maybe like what is the biggest like is it the front page news in the LA Times or something like big newspaper or New York Times or like? There's different news on the East Coast and the West Coast and different topics I used to live back east for college, and sometimes they paid for weather. It's like this long and like there's something called sleep.\n00:09:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nSure.\n00:09:32 Speaker 4\nWell, yeah, I think if you asked that for today, then every day it would change. So you'd be able to stay up on the neighbors.\n00:09:39 Speaker 2\nNews up to date, yeah.\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nThat's great. Is there anything else that you that you think you want to learn more about?\n00:09:50 Speaker 2\nUhm. Maybe I can ask her to say, like what? The weather is in my town. Or like, where my sister lives or my cousins live in, say, maybe wanna check in with. I'm gonna go with it later. I can check the weather first or something.\n00:10:11 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah, those are great topics that we can look at. Are you someone that likes to keep up on what's going on?\n00:10:21 Speaker 2\nYes, cause sometimes this phone talks to you, like mention it or just like what? But you need to be up to date.\n00:10:35 Speaker 1\nAwesome. OK. So Speaker 2, so I get you are very interested in sports such as swimming and maybe break dancing and and surfing water sports. Awesome.\n00:10:50 Speaker 2\nAnd also surfing. Yeah, I like modern sports. I like.\n00:10:58 Speaker 1\nOh, maybe for surfing. Is there anything that you're particularly interested in asking Speaker 3 about surfing?\n00:11:07 Speaker 2\nUM. Well. I was was like trying to. I think they have two athletes of different genders. I know that one of the girls is called Caroline Marks. I don't really know who the other surfer is. Maybe I'll ask her who they both are or something.\n00:11:26 Speaker 1\nOK, looks good. So who are the surf athletes?\n00:11:34 Speaker 2\nOhh, the Olympics are maybe the Olympic female surf athletes are are maybe US Olympics.\n00:11:47 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK, OK. And then the last thing we want to see and check on Speaker 2 is just how you create. Remember, last week we learned about creating a medication list. Do you still remember the command that you would use to? First create the medication list. On your Speaker 3 device.\n00:12:12 Speaker 2\nYou. Ask her for. Remember, it's like if you ask for. A list or something? Really reminder and you say I want and you add like either I type it or say like I want to add like. Like my two like like ohh my anti seizure meds and like Tylenol and and a couple of things, yeah.\n00:12:37 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So and. But in order to create that list, we would just say, Speaker 3, create a medication list. So do you want to go ahead and try that?\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nIt's called medication. What should I add to it?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nHe just woke up. Keppra.\n00:12:55 Speaker 3\nWe already have a list called medication.\n00:13:01 Speaker 2\nSo I ask, can you add Keppra?\n00:13:08 Speaker 3\nI've added Keppra to your medication list. What else can I add for you?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nCan you add Lamotrigine?\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nI've added Lamotrigine to your medication list. What other items do you? Want to end them? \n00:13:19 Speaker 2\nNone.\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:13:30 Speaker 2\nI did it, added my medicine.\n00:13:31 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nAnd even though there's some some other stuff they added to like like last time I added Tylenol and Pepto Bismol.\n00:13:43 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yeah. So you're just able to add to it. Very good.\n00:13:47 Speaker 2\nYeah, they say making marks like print, yeah.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nAnd then, uh, Speaker 2, would you continue to add to the medication list? Uh. I mean, would you like, as you know, the weeks go on not right now, but.\n00:14:07 Speaker 2\nYeah, like, well, if maybe my my neurologist puts you on a different medicine, I would have to change them out. And maybe I go on like. Maybe I'll switch from Tylenol to Advil and switch it up.\n00:14:22 Speaker 1\nUp. Yeah, I like that.\n00:14:26 Speaker 2\nSome people, some people like, really have a big choice and it's like. They feel good to me.\n00:14:33 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yes. I like that. Yeah, you're just just making it like up to date and current. Yeah.\n00:14:47 Speaker 2\nSometimes like, either my pharmacy wants to switch it up or my my neuro psych my I have a neurologist and a neuro psych. Sometimes they give me. Kind of a different list like what time do you go to my pharmacy? I have to get them both.\n00:15:07 Speaker 3\nThat's true.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nAnd then. OK, I think we're pretty much done. OK. Unless there's anything I'm missing.\n00:15:24 Speaker 4\nGenevieve, I don't. I'm lucky. I don't think so. I think that was. That was. Ohh, I was gonna ask so you said that your neurologist was changing up your medications, so.\n00:15:44 Speaker 2\nYeah, he was like it. Kind of like stepping down the amount of one pill and making the other one go up because it hadn't phase out one that was on early in my recovery. Now putting me more of one newer pill. I'm switching them out right now.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nSo you mentioned that you were maybe gonna change use Speaker 3 to change the reminders.\n00:16:10 Speaker 2\nYeah. Because like my dosage of this pill called Keppra is going down my pill range for this lamotrigine is going up so that he's going facing. Now one in yeah.\n00:16:24 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah.\n00:16:27 Speaker 1\nVery nice. OK. Yeah.\n00:16:35 Speaker 2\nLet's.\n00:16:35 Speaker 1\nSee. I think I wonder if others are. Done. If should we go to the main room and just wait for the rest of the groups?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 2, did you used to actually surf or do you just watch it?\n00:17:08 Speaker 2\nUmm well, like before my accident. I am. I would like you know when you surf. I would get the little ones like down in Doheny or the little ways, like two or two feet like little ones. And just like, ride them to shore. It's really easy, but it's fun.\n00:17:29 Speaker 1\nThat's. Looks awesome. Ohh yeah Bolsa Chica. I've heard of that beach. It's quite famous.\n00:17:34 Speaker 2\nIt's it's, it's famous and also like Bohemia's famous too. They're both name beaches, but they're like easy to access and they're off right off PCH. Yeah.\n00:17:37 Speaker 1\nYeah. Ohh. Nice. Yeah, that's really cool. Speaker 2, do you still like to go to the beach on your off days?\n00:17:59 Speaker 2\nWell, sometimes like. My my friends, the State Guard and sometimes she I'm trying to get reintroduced. Being in the water like she in the past, she would tell me to swim with her from tower to Tower. But like I'm just kind of I'm reintroduce myself to water cause like earlier this year at UM, some seizures, so when you go back in the waves do not want to have that happen. So, like need to reintroduce myself. That's why I'm in my community pool, doing some either treading water or trying to do some little half laps. So it's all in like working my head need to make it. Work.\n00:18:44 Speaker 1\nYes, you will definitely, yeah.\n00:18:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, I want to push myself.\n00:18:48 Speaker 1\nYeah. Has Speaker 3 been pretty good at reminding you about your physical therapy appointment?\n00:18:54 Speaker 2\nYes, because I have her one of my one of my alarms is I want to have I set it for like different days of the week. My PT's are always on Wednesday, so she has alarm for. Time to go and reminder like 20 minutes before so you know your PT outfit is different than just they hang out. Alpha is like my PT. My clinician is or my PT doctor said he knew where leg and stretch you out so. To change.\n00:19:26 Speaker 1\nOhh wow yeah. That's good. And then you have enough time to, like, put your hair up and.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nBecause like well before PT, I need to have it in a bun or back cause like. One of the things well, I'm tall and also I got a lot of hair. So like sometimes my my PT, he\u2019s like you need to tie that back.\n00:19:53 Speaker 1\nSo they tell you.\n00:19:54 Speaker 2\nYeah, like UM. They're like, that's their job, physical therapy? They need to stretch me out, and if this is in the way we need to put it back.\n00:20:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense, yeah. All right, so I think. We are going to close the breakout rooms in a second, so we'll meet each other back.\n00:20:17 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:20:32 Speaker 1\nAnd I'm excited to get to well, we're going to come back in our breakout rooms, but I'm excited for towards the end asking Speaker 3 and Speaker 2 having you ask Speaker 3 some of these questions that you were curious about. So.\n00:20:56 Speaker 4\nIs it gonna automatically? Close or do we need to leave?\n00:21:01 Speaker 1\nOh, oh, there we go.\n00:21:02 Speaker 2\nMy phone to me now.\n00:21:03 Speaker 1\nYes. All right. I'll see you back there.\n00:21:06 Speaker 2\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:21:19 Speaker 4\nHi. Hi.\n00:21:22 Speaker 2\nHi guys again.\n00:21:24 Speaker 1\nHello. OK, I will share my screen again and then. We can continue. All right, Speaker 2, do you see the screen?\n00:21:38 Speaker 2\nAs I can this is 2 commands. The person says her name start flash briefing.\n00:21:45\nMHM.\n00:21:46 Speaker 2\nThen second one stop. OK. So do you want me to ask it?\n00:21:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, yes. Yeah. Go ahead. Actually, I can play it on a slideshow. So you can do that one first and then Yep.\n00:22:01 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Start flash briefing.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:22:21 Speaker 2\nWright brothers.\n00:22:27 Speaker 3\nFrom Post reports.\n00:22:31 Speaker 3\nAs you've probably heard us talk about on the show, The Washington Post has a big team covering the Paris Olympics. They're following all the highlights and what's happening behind the scenes.\n00:22:43 Speaker 2\nThey just switched me over to like, like no news about the Paris Olympics. Going on right now.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nOhh very cool. Yeah, so it didn't. It didn't keep on going and going.\n00:22:55 Speaker 2\nNo, I just like just switching out right away, yeah.\n00:22:57 Speaker 1\nWith this thought. Oh, wow. OK, so you don't have to say stop because.\n00:23:02 Speaker 2\nNo, it's they kept on going. But I'm saying as long.\n00:23:08 Speaker 1\nOhh so did you stop it?\n00:23:09 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, hit the little stop button because it said it said 27 minutes. I'm not gonna wait.\n00:23:17 Speaker 1\nWow. OK, very good, very good. OK, let's go on to the next one then. OK, so this one is kind of like knowing what's going on in your own personal calendar. So, Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try this one?\n00:23:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what's on my calendar?\n00:23:46 Speaker 3\nThere's nothing scheduled for the next 30 days.\n00:23:51 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:23:52 Speaker 2\nAnd I haven't had to restart it, so it's like it says yes. Yeah, you need to re put them in here after, after, right after our session to update it for next week.\n00:24:07 Speaker 1\nSo if there's nothing on your calendar, do you want to try making an event for something?\n00:24:12 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Speaker 3, can you make an event for tomorrow morning at 11:00 AM?\n00:24:26 Speaker 3\nOK. And what's the name of the event?\n00:24:29 Speaker 2\nSaint Jude's therapy network.\n00:24:32 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:24:39 Speaker 2\nShe just added something to my calendar.\n00:24:41 Speaker 1\nNice success. Are there any? Are there any other events that that you want to add to Speaker 3?\n00:24:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's.\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:25:06 Speaker 3\nAnd one way that I've been keeping up on. All of it is. By listening to the posts pop up.\n00:25:12 Speaker 2\nThe poses kept on going. Maybe we can add some more events to my calendar.\n00:25:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, let's try one more.\n00:25:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, can I have? Can I schedule an event for Monday morning? Hey.\n00:25:43 Speaker 3\nMonday and time.\n00:25:45 Speaker 2\nMonday morning at 11:00 AM. Doctor.\n00:25:48 Speaker 3\nAnd the name of the event.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nDoctor Bellucci meeting.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:25:57 Speaker 2\nYeah. So it's on here.\n00:25:59 Speaker 1\nYay. OK, now Speaker 2, can you ask what's on my calendar? And let's see if Speaker 3. OK, fine.\n00:26:09 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what's on my calendar?\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nHere are your next two events. Tomorrow at 11:00 AM, there's Saint Jude's therapy network. On Monday, August 12th, at 11:00 AM, there's doctor Bellucci.\n00:26:31 Speaker 1\nNice six of this.\n00:26:32 Speaker 2\nBut it's like, you know, coming out like those are my most current appointments here.\n00:26:39 Speaker 1\nExactly. Yeah, I'm glad. OK. She is responding. Yes, very up to date. Awesome. OK, Genevieve, go ahead and and kind of take over.\n00:26:43 Speaker 2\nUp to date right now.\n00:26:56 Speaker 4\nSure. Umm. So let's look at some uh news. So can you read the command?\n00:27:03 Speaker 2\nOK, it says her name. Who is running for president? Who was running for president to ask her?\n00:27:14 Speaker 4\nYeah. So you can go ahead and ask her this.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'll do this training, OK. Speaker 3, who is running for president.\n00:27:26 Speaker 3\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior. Jill Stein, Cornell West and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:27:56 Speaker 2\nThat was kind of up to date.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nI do not know that did.\n00:27:57 Speaker 4\nYeah. I didn't even know that. Did you know about Speaker 2?\n00:28:02 Speaker 1\nVery cool.\n00:28:06 Speaker 2\nWell, like I heard about like the top two, like Kamala and Trump. And then like, I learned about. RFK Junior and then. They're only those three, but there's some other ones there's learn about right now.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nCast this moment hosted by my colleague Eva Wall.\n00:28:25 Speaker 4\nThat's great.\n00:28:31 Speaker 1\nAlright, OK, next is. MHM.\n00:28:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Do you want me to ask her?\n00:28:43 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah, let's go ahead. So you can ask Speaker 3 about, yeah, just like current events.\n00:28:51 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. When is the election?\n00:28:57 Speaker 3\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:29:14 Speaker 2\nIt's OK. It's like well, it's November 5th. That's in like three months.\n00:29:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.\n00:29:27 Speaker 2\nBut like, you know, usually like the two months before, it's like everywhere. And the news is like this, this.\n00:29:36 Speaker 4\nDo you? Do you have any? Like follow up questions that would be related to the election?\n00:29:45 Speaker 3\nOn today's episode of the Sports moments, David.\n00:29:49 Speaker 2\nI would just probably ask. Maybe the local election questions like in California, like who's gonna be the governor or something like that.\n00:30:00 Speaker 4\nOK, you want to try asking her that?\n00:30:07 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Who is running for Governor of California?\n00:30:15 Speaker 3\nThe candidates in the 2022 California election for governor were Gavin Newsom and Brian Dahl.\n00:30:24 Speaker 2\nOhh, there's two guys running for it, you know. They knew some of this other guy.\n00:30:31 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:30:33 Speaker 2\nSome guy called Brian Brian Dahl learned about it today.\n00:30:41 Speaker 4\nDo you know anything about them? Either of them?\n00:30:45 Speaker 2\nWell, like Gavin Newsom was our previous governor, he's like going to be running again, and this this other guy and put him in the Internet too, happens.\n00:30:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:30:57 Speaker 4\nSo you could put it in the Internet, or you could even ask. More questions maybe if you're not sure what you're going to vote.\n00:31:06 Speaker 3\nDan Zac, who was covering the.\n00:31:09 Speaker 2\nI could just ask her and. That's why that guy.\n00:31:16 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:31:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Should we go on to the next one? That was great.\n00:31:29 Speaker 1\nAlright, let's ask this, OK.\n00:31:37 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is interesting now?\n00:31:46 Speaker 3\nWelcome to what's interesting now. Each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Irvine from Los Angeles Times.\n00:32:03 Speaker 3\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig in Tahiti resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his surfing correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:32:21 Speaker 3\nFrom Los Angeles.\n00:32:22 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:32:23 Speaker 3\nThe British rock icon rock.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nThey're just doing on different news articles about.\n00:32:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you can tell Speaker 3 to stop anytime. Or. Yeah. Yeah, I think you just click.\n00:32:36 Speaker 2\nAre you just hit the little pause? Yeah, they're just right now. They were just going to, you know, the old Rod Stewart was like.\n00:32:38 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:32:45 Speaker 2\nI'm not old for that. Yeah. Because it says that Rod Stewart is.\n00:32:57 Speaker 3\nA cultural event.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nNow his biggest relevancy is his illness. Learned about that today.\n00:33:10 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2, there is another command that I can. Sorry, excuse me. There's another command that I can kind of. Teach you it's uh, I think it's like Speaker 3, what's the story? And do you want to try that? I don't know if it'll give you if that also is a skill that might give you some stories or I don't know how it's going to respond, but do you want? To try that one.\n00:33:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what is the story?\n00:33:48 Speaker 3\nA narrative story or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional or fictional.\n00:34:00 Speaker 1\nOK, sorry, I think I think.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nYeah, but. A different word.\n00:34:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, when I. Speaker 3 sometimes prompts can prompt you, so if she's talking about a certain news like headline, yeah, you can ask. What's the story? And then she'll kind of elaborate more on it.\n00:34:23 Speaker 2\nMore detail, OK.\n00:34:24 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So I think that's when it will be appropriate to use that one. Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right, let's go on to. The next one, no. All right. Sorry. Go ahead. Send a beep. OK.\n00:34:43 Speaker 4\nOK. So yeah, we can kind of see what it's like in your area or even like how we did in the other you can, you know, ask this question or ask for different areas. But why don't we start by trying this command?\n00:35:01 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'm asking. Speaker 3. What's the traffic like?\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:35:18 Speaker 2\nWell, she wants my work address.\n00:35:20 Speaker 3\nOK, currently, traffic on your commute looks good. The fastest route takes about one minute via Sierra Cello Rd.\n00:35:48 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah my work and where I am now is the same place. It's it's one minute comes.\n00:36:00 Speaker 4\nAnother thing that you could ask like when I used to drive in commute, I would drive on the 5 freeway, would even ask what's the traffic like on the 5 freeway or another freeway that you take a lot.\n00:36:16 Speaker 2\nAlright so. I'm gonna ask her, OK? Speaker 3, what is the traffic on the 405 freeway right now?\n00:36:28 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:33 Speaker 2\nOK, Speaker 3. What's the traffic like on the 405 freeway?\n00:36:41 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:46 Speaker 4\nI don't think she likes that command.\n00:36:48 Speaker 2\nNo, but like I live closer to the 405 than the five, but.\n00:36:54 Speaker 4\nYeah, maybe we could, I can look and see if I can figure out how. To reword it to ask about that, maybe next time.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, probably next time.\n00:37:07 Speaker 4\nLet's see. OK. All right, so this one, you can kind of look into some exercises, so let's try asking about this exercise.\n00:37:23 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK. Speaker 3. What are exercises for lower back pain?\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHere's something I found on reference.com partial crunches. Hamstring stretches, walls sits and bridging are four exercises that can improve lower back pain dot regular weight lifting and aerobic exercise such as walking, biking or running are also helpful. But people should stop these exercises if they cause any pain. For people who experience.\n00:38:06 Speaker 2\nShe listed, she listed it off. A good list of things like, you know, your lower back is like a big. Part of it, yeah, overall health. So you were standing up straight is always good.\n00:38:20 Speaker 4\nYeah. And you could even try this with, you know, other pain that you get too. Like, if you get pain in you know your neck or something like that. You could you could. Try that as well.\n00:38:31 Speaker 2\nAsk her for that. Yeah, because, like sometimes. Like my like the size of my neck scent is. My PT my PT says you're stiff. You stretch it out.\n00:38:46 Speaker 4\nYeah. All right, let's try one more.\n00:38:54 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:38:58 Speaker 4\nOK, so why don't you go ahead and ask this one?\n00:39:07 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:39:14 Speaker 3\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 3 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:39:32 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, you know this town, Olympia, maybe it's a real place.\n00:39:40 Speaker 1\nIt probably is, yeah.\n00:39:42 Speaker 2\nOver there.\n00:39:45 Speaker 1\nUh, this is actually a good segway. Speaker 2, do you want to ask a couple questions that you were actually genuinely curious about? Like the questions you were telling us earlier?\n00:39:58 Speaker 2\nRight.\n00:39:59 Speaker 1\nSo I yeah, I think they were. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sure you have them. It was about break dancing teams or like the other. The Surf, surf, athletes, anything that comes to mind.\n00:40:14 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. Who are the US Olympic female surfers?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nFrom surfacefootprint.com. The Olympic medal favorites in the male surfing event are John John Florence and Kolohe Andino, and the Olympic medal favorites in the female surfing event are Carissa Moon and Caroline Marks from the USA.\n00:40:46 Speaker 2\nWell, they gave me an overall answer, but the girls were on there like Caroline and this other girl. So even though the list of the boys too is like I know them.\n00:40:59 Speaker 4\nNow that's great.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nVery good. \n00:41:07 Speaker 2\nYeah. It's good for me.  It's like I hear them again, like if I'm in my room at night. She says something though. Need to be up to date.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nPlease have fun. Alright, so we are. Yeah, we're going to go back to the main room, but great job today. Speaker 2. I think I learned a lot.\n00:41:24 Speaker 2\nWe are all learning.\n00:41:29 Speaker 1\nThanks for your questions. Yeah.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** R.T.  \n**Date:** 08-08-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses a desire to utilize their Alexa device (Speaker 3) for accessing news and scheduling reminders.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nR.T. is a [age not specified] year-old [gender not specified] who is currently using an Alexa device to assist with scheduling and accessing information.

This could involve detailing the patient's objectives in using Alexa for specific tasks, such as asking information-seeking questions or managing daily activities.\n\n3. **Performance Metrics:**\n   - The target note includes specific performance metrics, such as the number of trials completed and the percentage of success. The generated note should include similar metrics to provide a more detailed assessment of the patient's progress and align with the target note's Objective section.\n\n4. **Detailed Engagement with Topics:**\n   - The target note discusses the patient's engagement with specific topics, such as the Olympics and elections, in detail. The generated note should emphasize these topics more prominently and provide a detailed account of the patient's interest and engagement with them.\n\n5. **Specific Homework and Strategies:**\n   - The target note outlines specific homework and strategies for the next session. The generated note should include similar details, specifying any assignments or strategies that will be implemented in future sessions to support the patient's progress.\n\n6. **Consistency in Sections:**\n   - Ensure that each section of the generated note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) is consistent with the target note in terms of content and focus. This includes maintaining a balance between technology use, medication management, and the patient's specific goals and interests.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving a closer alignment with the desired output. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> How closely does the generated SOAP note match this target SOAP note? Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET:   Subjective  (S):  MA  logged  in  for  the  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes\u201d   \u201cAlexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  can  you  repeat?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes\u201d  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  check  off  gum\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese\u201d   \u201cRead  me  option  one\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  option  two\u201d  \u201cAlexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk\u201d  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what\u2019s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe\u201d  \u201cHey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?\u201d  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?\u201d   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance \u201cAlexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese\u201d led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command \u201c Alexa, read me option one\u201d led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA\u2019s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn\u2019t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  clear  my  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers\u201d   \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-15-2024 (Week 5) M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Clinician\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient R.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Clinician\nSpeaker 11: Clinician\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 12: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver\nSpeaker 13: Clinician\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:02 Speaker 1\nPerfect. I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes. The caregiver and M.A. discussed various commands to improve the interaction with the device, including specific phrases to elicit better responses. M.A. expressed frustration with the device not reading out options clearly and the need for more straightforward commands. The caregiver suggested exploring different devices that might better suit M.A.'s needs.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** No significant medical history reported.\n- **Surgical History:** Not specified.\n- **Family History:** Not specified.\n- **Social History:** M.A. is engaged in a group therapy program focusing on meal preparation and dietary needs.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**\n- No allergies reported.\n- No other symptoms mentioned.\n\n**Current Medications:** Not specified.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:** Not documented.\n\n**Physical Exam Findings:** Not documented.\n\n**Laboratory Data:** Not applicable.\n\n**Imaging Results:** Not applicable.\n\n**Other Diagnostic Data:** \n- M.A. successfully interacted with the Alexa device to retrieve a recipe for Mac and cheese, but faced challenges in getting the device to read options and ingredients clearly.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem:** Difficulty using Alexa for recipe retrieval and shopping list management.\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Potential misunderstanding of device commands.\n     - Device limitations in reading options aloud.\n     - Need for a more suitable device (e.g., Echo Dot) for M.A.'s needs.\n\n**Discussion:** M.A. and the caregiver discussed various commands and settings that could improve the interaction with the Alexa device. The clinician noted the importance of finding a device that can better accommodate M.A.'s needs, especially in terms of auditory feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Device Optimization:**\n   - Research and explore settings on the Alexa device to enhance its ability to read recipes and options aloud.\n   - Consider trialing an Echo Dot or similar device that may provide better auditory feedback.\n\n2. **Patient Education:**\n   - Educate M.A. and the caregiver on specific commands that may yield better results when interacting with the device.\n   - Encourage practice with commands in a supportive environment to build confidence.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess improvements in device interaction and address any ongoing challenges.\n   - Discuss dietary preferences and restrictions in future sessions to tailor recipe suggestions.\n\n4. **Additional Resources:**\n   - Provide resources or links to online forums or support groups for users of similar devices to share tips and experiences.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- M.A. has shown improvement in vocalizing commands and engaging with the group therapy sessions.\n- The clinician will continue to monitor M.A.'s progress and adapt the plan as necessary to ensure effective use of technology in meal preparation and shopping management. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model and address the feedback on the LM_OUTPUT, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Inclusion of Specific Details**: The generated SOAP note should incorporate more specific details from the target note. For instance, it should include the specific user scenarios and commands practiced by M.A. during the session. This would align the generated note more closely with the target note's focus on VAT use and specific training exercises.\n\n2. **Subjective Section Alignment**: The \"Subjective\" section in the generated note should reflect the interactions and motivations described in the target note. This includes M.A.'s cooperation and motivation, as well as the role of his mother and clinicians in encouraging him to elaborate on his responses. Including these elements would provide a more accurate representation of the session's dynamics.\n\n3. **Objective Section Enhancement**: The \"Objective\" section should detail the user needs assessment and the specific commands practiced, as outlined in the target note. This would provide a comprehensive view of M.A.'s progress and the areas where VAT use is beneficial, which are crucial for understanding the session's outcomes.\n\n4. **Assessment Section Depth**: The \"Assessment\" section should delve deeper into the specific challenges M.A. faced with the Alexa device, as described in the target note. This includes the issues with verbal output and the need for prompts to speak louder. A detailed analysis of these challenges would enhance the assessment's accuracy.\n\n5. **Plan Section Specificity**: The \"Plan\" section should include the specific tasks and commands for M.A. to practice, as outlined in the target note's home exercise program. This would provide a clear and actionable plan for M.A. to improve his interaction with the device.\n\n6. **Overall Tone and Detail**: The generated note should aim to match the target note's level of detail and specificity. This includes providing a thorough account of M.A.'s interactions, challenges, and the context of the training. A more detailed and specific note would reduce the divergence from the target note and lower the loss score.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better align with the target note, thereby enhancing the overall quality and accuracy of the generated SOAP note. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

This includes the exact commands practiced, the challenges faced, and the strategies discussed to overcome these challenges. By doing so, the LLM can generate a more comprehensive and aligned note.\n\n3. **Encourage Detailed Analysis**: The system prompt should guide the LLM to perform a deeper analysis of the challenges M.A. faced with the Alexa device. This includes understanding the issues with verbal output, the need for prompts to speak louder, and the specific user needs assessment. Encouraging a detailed analysis will enhance the accuracy of the \"Assessment\" section.\n\n4. **Focus on Actionable Plans**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to create a \"Plan\" section that includes specific tasks and commands for M.A. to practice, as outlined in the target note's home exercise program. This will provide a clear and actionable plan for M.A. to improve his interaction with the device.\n\n5. **Balance Between Structure and Flexibility**: While the SOAP note structure is important, the prompt should also allow for flexibility in rearranging the order if it benefits the clarity and relevance of the information. For instance, considering the APSO order if it provides a more logical flow of information.\n\n6. **Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms**: The prompt should include a mechanism for the LLM to incorporate feedback from previous iterations, allowing it to refine its responses based on what has been effective or ineffective in past outputs.\n\n7. **Enhance Tone and Detail**: The prompt should guide the LLM to match the tone and level of detail of the target note. This includes providing a thorough account of M.A.'s interactions, challenges, and the context of the training, ensuring the generated note is as detailed and specific as the target note.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt can better guide the LLM to produce a SOAP note that aligns more closely with the target note, thereby improving the overall quality and accuracy of the generated response.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 (Week 2) R.T.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right.

Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places.

The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Alignment with Target Note Structure**: The generated SOAP note should more closely align with the structure and focus of the target note. This means reducing the emphasis on detailed patient information and instead concentrating on the therapy session's goals, outcomes, and specific activities. By mirroring the target note's concise and focused approach, the generated note will better match the expected format.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Specific Goals and Outcomes**: The target note includes a clear goal related to the use of concise voice commands with a specific accuracy percentage and cue level. The generated note should incorporate similar quantifiable goals and outcomes to reflect the patient's performance in therapy. This will help in achieving a closer match to the target note's objectives.\n\n3. **Relevance of Content**: The generated note includes sections such as vital signs and medications, which are not relevant to the therapy session described in the target note. Removing these sections and focusing on the therapy-related content will improve the alignment with the target note.\n\n4. **Use of Terminology**: The language model should use terminology that is consistent with the target note. This includes focusing on therapy-specific terms and avoiding overly clinical language that does not pertain to the session's objectives.\n\n5. **Assessment and Plan Specificity**: The assessment and plan sections in the generated note should be more specific and aligned with the target note. This includes mentioning any homework assignments, strategies, or specific actions that the patient should take, as outlined in the target note.\n\n6. **Focus on Therapy Process and Outcomes**: The generated note should emphasize the therapy process and outcomes, similar to the target note. This includes detailing the patient's performance during the session, the use of voice commands, and any progress made towards the therapy goals.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving the objective function more effectively. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET: Subjective  (S):    M.A.  logged  onto  the  session  on  time  and  was  accompanied  by  mom.  He  was  prompted  by  mom throughout the session when Alexa didn't pick up command.M.A. was cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. His mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.   Objective  (O):    Review  of  week  2  content  related  to  entertainment  was  completed  first.  M.A.  was  asked  to  play any music or video of his choice using his Echo device.  Practiced  commands:  \u201cAlexa,  play  a  video  from  January  3rd.\u201d  accurately  in  1/1  attempts.   -  His  mother  mentioned  syncing  his  Apple  music  account  to  the  Amazon  Echo  Device/Alexa account which made it possible for Alexa to access the content from his phone and in turn, was able to play a video from a specific date.  -  He  also  practiced  a  command  to  stop  the  video  or  music  (\u201cAlexa,  Stop\u201d)   that  was  playing in 1 out of 2 attempts needing mod cueing to unmute the device before executing this command.  His  mother  mentioned  that  MA  has  been  able  to  use  Alexa  for  playing  Bon  Jovi  songs  that  he likes to listen. His mother asked questions related to syncing a radio station to his Echo device and similarly was also interested in using the BARD library for blind app on his Echo device to improve his accessibility to the entertainment/books without assistance from his caregivers.   User  Needs  Assessment:   Interview  style  Q  and  A  completed  to  learn  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs  related  to  self  care  and medical needs.  -  MA  needs  assistance  with  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  such  as  washing  hair,  brushing teeth, trimming nails and eating breakfast -  He  depends  entirely  on  his  parents  for  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  except  for  sometimes setting reminders for various needs  Scenarios  for  using  Alexa  for  self-care  and  medical  needs:   Dosage  of  medication,  reminder  to  refill/reorder  medication,  reminders  to  have  breakfast  on  certain time, brushing teeth at a certain time, reading the medication list for morning routine/evening, checking off the medications that have been taken for that particular day.  MA  was  introduced  to  tactically  feel  the  button  for  mute  and  unmute  on  top  of  the  Echo  device for him to be able to improve his ability to use the device more independently.   Command  training/practice:   MA  practiced  17  commands  related  to  self-care  and  medical  needs.  He  executed  verbal  commands for creating a medication list, adding a medication (tylenol) to the created list, read the medication list back  (\u201cAlexa, read me my medication list\u201d), reminder for taking a specific medication (depocope) at a given time (\u201cAlexa, remind me to take decocope tomorrow at 7.30 am\u201d), reminder for doing laundry, steps on how to do the laundry in 1/1 attempts  using  the  verbal  prompts  and  modeling  provided  by  the  clinician  and  his  mother  both. He was also able to ask questions including where he could find tylenol, how to get stains out clothes, how to use a fabric softener, how to treat a migraine, what to take for stomach ache, and asking on how to find a physical therapist.    Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:   With  the  Q  and  A  style  interview  questions,  the  participant  continues  to  need  mod  to  max  cueing and scaffolding from his mother and clinicians to participate and elaborate on his subjective responses. For self care and medical needs, the participant is caregiver dependent and the use of Alexa would assist the participant in being independent with reminders for medications, asking questions regarding tasks related to this topic  The  participant  continued  to  demonstrate  progress  with  his  ability  to  execute  the  commands  this week given min to mod verbal prompting and cueing to be a louder and over articulate to ensure the ASR would recognize the command Given  MA  that  is  blind,  the  command  related  to  steps  or  instructions  to  do  laundry  was  the  one that was the most challenging. The Echo Show presented the written steps or instructions to complete laundry on the screen; however it wouldn\u2019t provide verbal output for the same. This required the clinician and his mother to prompt MA to execute different reworded commands to determine that the device was reading one step at a time to complete this task (laundry). The command that produced the desired results was \u201cAlexa, read me the instructions to do laundry one step at a time\u201d. Although, this command still yielded verbal output of all the steps at once instead of proving one step at a time. With the command \u201cwhat do I take for stomach pain?\u201d, the command was not processed and needed to be reworded to \u201cstomach ache\u201d   Plan  (P):   Participant  encouraged  to  talk  slower  and  over  articulate  with  complex  words  like  names  of  the medications etc to improve the ASR of the system. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:  Medications  (dosage,  reminders,  creating  medication  lists-adding,  deleting,  reading to the medication list)  Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  what  dosage  of  tylenol  can  I  take  at  once\u201d   Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  remind  me  to  refill  my  prescription  for  depakote\u201d  *alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-01-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Breakout room training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Clinician\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient F.W.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Patient L.V.G.\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nRecording. So we're gonna go over some questions related to self-care and medical needs today. So first of all, though, we're going to do a little review of the last week's comments. So you're going to show me how you can play music, play music, or a video of your choice with your Speaker 4 device. So you want to go ahead and do that? Speaker 2, do you want to give it a command?\n00:00:37 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you play? A video from. January 3rd. OK.\n00:00:56 Speaker 1\nDoes it? Is it playing anything?\n00:00:58 Speaker 3\nYes it is.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:01:00 Speaker 3\nI hooked up Speaker 2's apple music. To the elect. Don't ask me how I did it, but. I figured it out. OK. We did hook it up and he's been able. He's been using that feature a lot, he'll say, play Bon Jovi or and it will just start playing a. Yeah. Bunch of Bon Jovi songs.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK. So when?\n00:01:27 Speaker 3\nBut I do have a question.\n00:01:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, go ahead. Yeah.\n00:01:31 Speaker 3\nThat just turn it off, Speaker 2.\n00:01:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:38 Speaker 3\nLouder.\n00:01:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:01:42 Speaker 3\nIt's muted. That's fine.\n00:01:43 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:48 Speaker 3\nIn in relation to the music, Speaker 2 listens to a radio station in the mornings. It's a KC 790.\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nUh-huh.\n00:01:59 Speaker 3\nSo is there a way to hook that up as well?\n00:02:04 Speaker 1\nThere should be actually.\n00:02:08 Speaker 3\nAnd if not, I believe the show he listens to is on that iheart app. So I don't, I do, we don't have that either, but I those are that was part part one and we could hook it up then it would be the same way. Part 2 is Speaker 2 gets books from. Guard. Which is for from Berlin Institute their books. It's a reading library and you choose your books on Bard and then you can play. Listen to your books. Is it possible to hook that up to Speaker 4 or should it just be YouTube? On YouTube you can actually listen to all kinds of stories as well.\n00:02:51 Speaker 1\nRight, so I'm pretty. Sure that the audible, I I don't know if you know there's a there's a website called Audible which has audible books. I'm pretty sure that can be hooked up to Speaker 4. I am not very sure about about the board. OK. But I can check and let you know about that one. Yeah, I I can research a little bit and maybe maybe get back to you is it called Bard Bard.\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOhh OK. Correct. OK. It's rail institute.\n00:03:25 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK, alright, let me check I I almost wonder if if it could be. Synced into your phone. And because your phones Speaker 4 is synced in with the Speaker 4 on the Echo. So if it could be played on the phone, it could be played on here, but I will check and let.\n00:03:44 Speaker 4\nUh-huh.\n00:03:51 Speaker 1\nYou know for sure.\n00:03:52 Speaker 3\nOK. And just so you know, I put the Bard app is on his iPad and I put the Speaker 4 app on the iPad.\n00:03:58 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nAnd they're both and. The pad is linked to the.\n00:04:02 Speaker 1\nPhone, phone. Perfect. So, alright. OK. I can. I can look that up for sure. One was the Bard and then other one was the.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nOh.\n00:04:11 Speaker 1\nMusic. You said. No. What? What was that?\n00:04:13 Speaker 3\nAt the radio station, it's OK.\n00:04:15 Speaker 1\nRadio station about yes.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nAt K ABC 790 OK Yeah 790.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nABC.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAll right. So all right, those are very specific questions, so.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nI didn't. Well, we're we're trying.\n00:04:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, no, that's perfect. But so Speaker 2, I had a question. So when you said Speaker 4 play a video from January 3rd, what did it bring up? Did it, was it anything specific that what what did was that the command that he that you gave?\n00:04:48 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what command did you give?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nJust command.\n00:04:53 Speaker 3\nCan you repeat it? Yeah. What was it?\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nYou like to play. New memory from January 3rd.\n00:05:03 Speaker 3\nA memory from January.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\n3rd memory OK, play a memory from OK. So did it. What did it bring up? I'm just curious.\n00:05:14 Speaker 3\nIt did. It was a video and then the music started playing.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nFor you.\n00:05:20 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK. All right, but. Very nice, Speaker 2. I mean, I'm, I'm so impressed. All right, so.\n00:05:31 Speaker 4\nThat for you.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:05:34 Speaker 1\nAll right, perfect. All right, Speaker 2. So let's move over to this week's topic. What type? So I have a few questions I want to ask you. First, initially to 1st ASK is is like what is your goal when it comes to self-care and medical needs? Using Speaker 4, what would you say your goal is?\n00:06:02 Speaker 3\nFor health and medical needs, Speaker 2 to use Speaker 4.\n00:06:04 Speaker 2\nHow's the mass on each? Here. Brushing my teeth.\n00:06:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright. What did you what? What else did you say?\n00:06:23 Speaker 3\nTrimming his nails.\n00:06:25 Speaker 1\nOK, trimming the nails. Perfect. Alright. Anything else you can think of?\n00:06:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, eating breakfast.\n00:06:36 Speaker 1\nCorrect. So eating meals on time?\n00:06:39 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:06:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n00:07:07 Speaker 3\nAre you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:07:16 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n00:07:40 Speaker 2\nMy iPhone.\n00:07:42 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n00:07:56 Speaker 3\nAre you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n00:08:00 Speaker 2\nMaking reminders on the iPhone.\n00:08:04 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nSo OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n00:08:50 Speaker 3\nIf I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n00:09:06 Speaker 1\nGot it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n00:10:11 Speaker 2\nSo I can. Make goals.\n00:10:17 Speaker 3\nMake goals.\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:21 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n00:11:00 Speaker 3\nWould you like her to remind you?\n00:11:04 Speaker 3\nTo eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n00:11:12 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:11:15 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nBrushing my teeth.\n00:11:37 Speaker 3\nBrushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n00:11:40 Speaker 1\nAll right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n00:12:13 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n00:12:27 Speaker 1\nYours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nThe same right? And that makes like more.\n00:12:49 Speaker 1\nYou think of that, Speaker 2?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nThat's a good idea.\n00:12:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n00:13:59 Speaker 3\nFair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n00:14:13 Speaker 4\nMHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nThat'd be good. OK.\n00:14:21 Speaker 3\nBecause I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n00:14:31 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:14:31 Speaker 3\nWould be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n00:14:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n00:14:54 Speaker 3\nOK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n00:15:09 Speaker 1\nUh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n00:15:12 Speaker 3\nA barred book is what I'm thinking.\n00:15:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n00:15:25 Speaker 3\nOh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n00:15:42 Speaker 1\nYou know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n00:16:19 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n00:16:21 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n00:16:40 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:16:42 Speaker 1\nI almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n00:16:46 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:16:47 Speaker 1\nThe device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n00:16:50 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:17:08 Speaker 1\nBecause there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n00:17:19 Speaker 3\nWell, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n00:17:26 Speaker 1\nThat's all.\n00:17:31 Speaker 3\nFeel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n00:17:35 Speaker 1\nThat would be great.\n00:17:35 Speaker 3\nCould behind.\n00:17:38 Speaker 1\nThat would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n00:17:44 Speaker 3\nOK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n00:17:52 Speaker 1\nOhh OK Speaker 2.\n00:17:57 Speaker 3\nThey were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n00:18:05 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:18:08 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:18:08 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:18:11 Speaker 3\nThere. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n00:18:15 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:18:16 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n00:18:41 Speaker 1\nYeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n00:18:49 Speaker 3\nBut an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n00:18:53 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:18:55 Speaker 3\nDo I just say to open the bar app?\n00:18:59 Speaker 1\nYeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n00:19:03 Speaker 3\nOK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n00:19:25 Speaker 1\nNo, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n00:19:57 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nSearching for the.\n00:20:04 Speaker 3\nBard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n00:20:12 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:20:14 Speaker 4\nCouncil.\n00:20:15 Speaker 1\nIs there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n00:21:05 Speaker 4\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n00:21:08 Speaker 3\nOK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n00:21:18 Speaker 4\nSearching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n00:21:19 Speaker 3\nIt's not understanding the bars.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nThat's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n00:21:26 Speaker 3\nMaybe yeah.\n00:21:29 Speaker 1\nAnother another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n00:21:59 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:02 Speaker 1\nTo.\n00:22:04 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n00:22:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n00:22:25 Speaker 3\nNope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nIs Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n00:22:46 Speaker 3\nNo, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nIt's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n00:22:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nIt's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n00:23:15 Speaker 3\nI'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n00:23:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n00:23:48 Speaker 4\nMy.\n00:23:52 Speaker 1\nAlright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n00:24:20 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:24:21 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n00:24:46 Speaker 3\nThe breakout room.\n00:24:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:24:48 Speaker 3\nOK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n00:24:51 Speaker 1\nAbsolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- \nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 2.\n00:25:10 Speaker 2\nHey, what's up?\n00:25:12 Speaker 1\nAlright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n00:25:50 Speaker 3\nUnmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n00:26:07 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:26:11 Speaker 3\nOK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n00:26:12 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Could.\n00:26:21 Speaker 1\nOK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:28 Speaker 2\nOK. Thank you.\n00:26:30 Speaker 3\nGo ahead.\n00:26:31 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:44 Speaker 4\nI've checked off oranges from medication.\n00:26:47 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:26:49 Speaker 1\nOhh did it say check off?\n00:26:49 Speaker 3\nAnd. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n00:26:55 Speaker 1\nNo longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n00:27:25 Speaker 2\nIbuprofen.\n00:27:27 Speaker 1\nOK, well you have been.\n00:27:28 Speaker 3\nWhat's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n00:27:38 Speaker 2\nTypical.\n00:27:39 Speaker 3\nOK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n00:27:42 Speaker 2\nEvery day.\n00:27:43 Speaker 3\nAt what time? In the morning it's at.\n00:27:53 Speaker 2\n7:30.\n00:27:55 Speaker 3\nOK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n00:28:00 Speaker 1\nOK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n00:28:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n00:28:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n00:28:22 Speaker 3\n10.\n00:28:23 Speaker 1\n7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to take Depakote at 7:30 AM tomorrow.\n00:28:42 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:47 Speaker 1\nOK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n00:29:09 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:29:10 Speaker 1\nOK, let's do that command.\n00:29:15 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n00:29:31 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n00:29:36 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n00:30:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:30:29 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away on Canyon Way, right? A 1.4 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite 110, Walgreens 2.3 miles away on Haven Ave. you can ask me for things like what's the phone number for the first one?\n00:30:51 Speaker 1\nOK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n00:31:04 Speaker 3\nIf that makes sense.\n00:31:07 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n00:31:49 Speaker 3\nJust so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nRight, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n00:32:08 Speaker 3\nJust so you. You had a heads up and. So you you know what?\n00:32:13 Speaker 1\nI mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n00:32:45 Speaker 3\nHe didn't.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I do my laundry?\n00:32:59 Speaker 1\nDid it pick it up?\n00:33:01 Speaker 3\nIt it's showing it's. A video and pictures and a lot of words on how to do it. Let me just make sure the volumes up, yeah, the volumes 3/4.\n00:33:14 Speaker 1\nOh, OK.\n00:33:16 Speaker 3\nIt picked it up but it. I don't know if my cord. Will reach the camera.\n00:33:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Is it is it more visual? Maybe like rather than ohh it's like a very text. It's all.\n00:33:30 Speaker 3\nIt's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n00:33:36 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n00:33:59 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Give me the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:12 Speaker 3\nIt's doing the same thing, the same thing. Try tell me how to do laundry that way you're telling her to? Read it to. You.\n00:34:21 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:34:22 Speaker 3\nSorry again, Speaker 2.\n00:34:25 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Hey, Speaker 4. Tell me how to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:40 Speaker 3\nIt's written again. It's written again. OK, OK, directions. Speaker 2.\n00:34:50 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me the directions to do my laundry.\n00:34:58 Speaker 4\nAt the moment, traffic to vineyards marketplace cleaners at 11460 Canyon Way looks pretty clear.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nOhh it's giving like.\n00:35:05 Speaker 4\nJust about 3 minutes via Canyon with her place.\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's a.\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nYeah. It's like a laundromat. Probably gets. Right. OK, alright. Alright, let's try another one. OK, let's try this set reminder to do laundry. Maybe that's a function more functional one. I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n00:35:54 Speaker 2\nM. OK.\n00:35:57 Speaker 3\nGo.\n00:35:58 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to. Do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:05 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:36:07 Speaker 2\nTo do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:11 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:36:12 Speaker 2\nTomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:20 Speaker 4\nIs that 5:00? In the morning or in the afternoon.\n00:36:22 Speaker 2\nIn the afternoon.\n00:36:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.\n00:36:32 Speaker 1\nBye. Purpose. OK, good job. Does these kind of reminders help Speaker 2? Maybe. That would be more functional in the real life, you think.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 1\nAlright, yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. When I asked Speaker 2, I was cooking and I asked him to set the timer for me and that was very optional. Yes.\n00:36:57 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, that is great.\n00:37:01 Speaker 3\nAnd she even told. Speaker 4, to set my mom at the time.\n00:37:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. So. OK. OK. All right, so getting stains out of clothes. What else?\n00:37:19 Speaker 3\nOK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n00:37:21 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n00:37:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:37:44 Speaker 3\nWhat?\n00:37:44 Speaker 2\nWhat do I use to get a stain out of my clothes?\n00:37:52 Speaker 4\nTo remove stains from clothes, rinse the stain with cold water and scrub it with the brush and soap. If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in cold water and soak for an hour. Then wash the clothing as usual.\n00:38:06 Speaker 3\nThis one showed the words in paragraph as well as Reddit.\n00:38:11 Speaker 1\nThat's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n00:38:18 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:38:37 Speaker 1\nText. But. I almost wonder for the laundry part. If we'd ask her to give me the first step to do my laundry or something like that.\n00:38:51 Speaker 3\nYeah. Try that, Speaker 2.\n00:38:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you give me the first step to do my laundry?\n00:39:06 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:39:08 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n00:39:41 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:39:41 Speaker 3\nI think that was the paragraph that she didn't read before.\n00:39:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, but it read. It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n00:40:20 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:40:24 Speaker 1\nDo you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n00:40:48 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. When do I use the fabric softener?\n00:40:57 Speaker 4\nAccording to an Speaker 4 Answers contributor. Add fabric softener to the wash during the rinse cycle.\n00:41:05 Speaker 1\nOK. All right.\n00:41:08 Speaker 3\nMakes sense?\n00:41:09 Speaker 1\nOK, I think this is pretty functional here. So Speaker 2 say that you have a headache and you need some answers on how to treat it on your own. So you're going to say the wake word and say, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:32 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:42 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for a migraine include applying ice packs to the back of the neck, forehead or temples, taking a nap, taking a warm shower or bath, massage, drinking water resting in a low lit room, or physical therapy.\n00:42:00 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. OK. All right, let's do the same for stomach pains. OK, so say you have a sudden stomach pain and you want to know what remedies you can use. So you're going to say the wake word. And what do I take for stomach pains? Ready. Cool.\n00:42:27 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:35 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:42:38 Speaker 4\nHuh.\n00:42:40 Speaker 1\nInteresting. Let me try that one more time, OK. On mine, Speaker 4, mute. What do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:55 Speaker 4\nI don't know that one.\n00:42:58 Speaker 1\nIt says the same thing for me too.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nOh wow.\n00:43:02 Speaker 1\nYeah. So we'll have to try that one one more time.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n00:43:14 Speaker 1\nOK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n00:43:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:43:27 Speaker 1\nUh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:09 Speaker 3\nWhat kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:20 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. All Star physical therapy 3.1 miles away on Rochester Ave. Suite 110, team Physical therapy, 3 miles away on Town Center. Dr. Rancho San Antonio Rehab Center, 2.3 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite G30.\n00:44:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n00:45:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's.\n00:45:21 Speaker 2\nYeah it does.\n00:45:24 Speaker 1\nOK, I think we are through with the slides. Let me stop sharing my screen. OK. Any questions about anything we did today?\n00:45:37 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:45:38 Speaker 1\nNo. OK, how about you?\n00:45:40 Speaker 3\nMom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n00:45:51 Speaker 4\nHmm.\n00:45:53 Speaker 3\nI'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n00:45:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n00:46:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:46:49 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:49 Speaker 3\nYou know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n00:46:55 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:47:01 Speaker 3\nDo you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n00:47:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n00:47:40 Speaker 3\nSo I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:47:58 Speaker 4\nYou.\n00:47:59 Speaker 4\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n00:48:01 Speaker 1\nYeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n00:48:01 Speaker 3\nAnd it was.\n00:48:20 Speaker 1\nBecause once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n00:48:33 Speaker 3\nRight. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n00:48:55 Speaker 1\nYes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n00:50:15 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:50:16 Speaker 1\nError. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n00:50:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n00:50:32 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:50:33 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:50:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n00:50:44 Speaker 3\nOhh no, I think we're good, thank.\n00:50:45 Speaker 1\nYou OK? Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and I. Hey. Will get back to you, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:50:57 Speaker 4\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will be oh. I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slide a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So expect another homework for this week, self-care inform. Just just to double check that you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two, you got all the slides. I know, Speaker 6, you got it, Speaker 2, you got it. OK, Speaker 10, you got it too. Yeah. I need to do mine.\n00:51:40 Speaker 10\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n00:51:49 Speaker 4\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Speaker 9, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our part point training. So after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be anytime. But if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd, the so think week six. If you go by numbers in. Your head.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:52:42 Speaker 4\nWeek 6 we would like to hear from you. Just we were asking some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well, you can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share. Together, because chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel, feel free to bring them as well. And I'll send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n00:53:31 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:53:33 Speaker 4\nAny questions?\n00:53:34 Speaker 5\nSorry. Speaker 6, we we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 6, if you still want to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and. Then we'll let. You go, I promise. Sounds good. OK. OK.\n00:53:47 Speaker 4\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can debrief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday.\n00:54:04 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:54:07 Speaker 4\nAll right, Speaker 6, I'm going to open the breakout room. OK. Uh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 6 and Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 can go. And don't forget to record.

It's super helpful.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities. The patient\u2019s caregiver reports that M.A. has been using the device to play music and videos, set reminders for medications, and manage self-care tasks such as brushing teeth and trimming nails. The patient expresses a desire to improve independence in managing these tasks.\n\n**Goals for Self-Care:**\n- Use technology to remember daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals on time).\n- Set reminders for medication intake (currently taking medications twice daily).\n- Explore additional functionalities of the Alexa device to assist with self-care and medical needs.\n\n**Current Medications:**\n- Depakote (dosage and frequency not specified, but taken twice daily).\n\n**Social History:**\n- M.A. is supported by a caregiver who assists with technology and daily tasks.\n- The patient has access to an iPhone and an iPad, which are used to set reminders and manage tasks.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**\n- No acute symptoms reported; focus is on technology use for self-care management.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Physical Exam Findings:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Technology Assessment:**\n- M.A. successfully used the Alexa device to play music and videos.\n- Caregiver reports that M.A. has set reminders for medications on the iPhone.\n- Discussion about integrating additional functionalities of the Alexa device for reminders related to self-care tasks.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem 1: Difficulty in managing self-care tasks independently.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Lack of familiarity with technology.\n     - Need for structured reminders for daily tasks.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. is currently reliant on caregivers for reminders and assistance with self-care tasks. The use of technology is a positive step towards independence, but further integration and training are needed.\n\n2. **Problem 2: Medication management.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:**\n     - Potential for missed doses if reminders are not effectively set.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. takes medications twice daily and has set reminders on the iPhone. There is a need to ensure that the Alexa device can also assist with medication reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **For Self-Care Management:**\n   - Explore the possibility of setting up a checklist on the Alexa device for daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals).\n   - Research the integration of the Bard app for audiobooks and other reading materials to be accessible via the Alexa device.\n   - Consider implementing tactile markers (bump dots) on the Alexa device to assist M.A. in independently using the mute/unmute functions.\n\n2. **For Medication Management:**\n   - Confirm that reminders for medication intake can be set on the Alexa device.\n   - Educate M.A. on how to use the Alexa device to check off medications taken and set reminders for refills.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess the effectiveness of the implemented strategies and make adjustments as necessary.\n   - Encourage the caregiver to continue supporting M.A. in using the technology and to provide feedback on its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - Provide M.A. and the caregiver with resources on how to maximize the use of the Alexa device for self-care and medication management.\n\n---\n\n**Signature:**\n[Clinician's Name]  \n[Clinician's Title]  \n[Date]   </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model and address the feedback on the LM_OUTPUT, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Incorporate Session Dynamics:**\n   - The generated SOAP note should include more details about the session dynamics, particularly the interaction between M.A. and his mother. Emphasizing the mother's role in prompting and providing additional details can align the note more closely with the target. This can be achieved by explicitly mentioning instances where the mother assisted M.A. during the session.\n\n2. **Detail Specific Commands and Success Rates:**\n   - The Objective section should include specific details about the commands M.A. practiced, along with success rates and any assistance required. This would provide a more comprehensive view of M.A.'s performance and align with the target note's detailed account. Including examples of commands practiced and the context of the training would enhance the specificity of the note.\n\n3. **Remove Unnecessary Elements:**\n   - The inclusion of a \"Chief Complaint\" and \"History of Present Illness\" may not be necessary if they do not align with the target note's focus. Consider removing these elements or integrating them in a way that reflects the session's focus on technology use and the mother's involvement.\n\n4. **Focus on Progress and Challenges:**\n   - The Assessment section should focus more on M.A.'s progress and specific challenges faced during the session, particularly with the Alexa device. Avoid formal differential diagnoses if they are not present in the target note. Instead, provide a narrative that highlights M.A.'s progress and the challenges encountered, such as issues with command recognition or device functionality.\n\n5. **Include Specific Home Practice Tasks:**\n   - The Plan section should detail specific commands and tasks that M.A. was encouraged to practice at home. This would provide clear guidance for M.A. and his caregiver, similar to the target note. Including a list of commands for home practice would enhance the note's utility and specificity.\n\n6. **Enhance Contextual Relevance:**\n   - Ensure that the note reflects the context of the session, including any discussions about integrating additional functionalities of the Alexa device. This would provide a more holistic view of the session and align with the target note's emphasis on technology use for self-care and medication management.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, reducing the loss score and enhancing the overall quality and relevance of the generated note. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET: Subjective  (S):   M.A.  logged  onto  his  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?\u201d  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  \u201cTrazadone\u201d  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week\u2019s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. \u201cIs there a fact you would like to know?\u201d) M.A. practice the following commands: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?\u201d  -  \u201c Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cFor  the  gym\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?\u201d  -  \u201cAlexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?\u201d   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying \u201csuch as___\u201d to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.\u2019s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as \u201cWho do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?\u201d  and  \u201cIs  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?\u201d.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  news  and  facts.  Please  practice  these  five commands with your Alexa. Record each command you practice and then submit it to researchers  Task  1:  Telling  Joke  1.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  a  joke\u201d   Task  2:  Asking  for  the  Weather  2.  \u201cAlexa,  what\u2019s  the  weather?\u201d   Task  3:  Asking  for  News  3.  \u201cAlexa,  play  flash  briefing\u201d   Task  4:  Searching  for  Information  4.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  where  I  can  buy  cold  medicine\u201d  5.  \u201cAlexa,  where  is  the  nearest  gas  station?\u201d  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Individual training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver \nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A. \nSpeaker 3: Clinician \nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa \nSpeaker 5: Clinician \nSpeaker 6: Clinician \nSpeaker 7: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver \nSpeaker 8: Clinician\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nWe did the. Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model and address the feedback on the LM_OUTPUT, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Alignment with Target Note Structure**: The generated SOAP note should more closely follow the structure and content of the target note. This includes focusing on the specific details of M.A.'s session, such as the involvement of his mother, the nature of verbal cues, and the specific commands practiced. By aligning the structure, the generated note will better match the target note, reducing the loss score.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Session Details**: The target note provides a detailed account of the session, including specific commands M.A. practiced and the interactions with his mother and clinician. The generated note should incorporate these details to provide a comprehensive view of the session. This includes listing the specific commands practiced and describing the dynamics of the session, such as the need for prompting and redirection.\n\n3. **Focus on Interaction Dynamics**: The target note emphasizes the interaction between M.A., his mother, and the clinician. The generated note should reflect this by highlighting the role of M.A.'s mother in providing verbal cues and support. This focus on interaction dynamics is crucial for accurately capturing the essence of the session.\n\n4. **Reduction of Clinical Perspective**: The generated note introduces a clinical perspective with differential diagnoses and a structured plan, which is not present in the target note. To improve alignment, the generated note should reduce the emphasis on clinical analysis and instead focus on the practical aspects of the session, such as the specific commands and homework assignments.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Homework Assignments**: The target note includes specific homework assignments related to the session. The generated note should incorporate these assignments to provide a complete picture of the session's objectives and follow-up actions.\n\n6. **Consistency in Content and Focus**: The generated note should maintain consistency in content and focus with the target note. This includes ensuring that all relevant details from the target note are present in the generated note, such as the specific commands practiced and the role of M.A.'s mother in the session.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby achieving a lower loss score and meeting the objective function more effectively. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

So. Since today's topic is Entertainment, we are going to oh, sorry 11 moment. Oh, ignore the noise, OK? But we are going to kind of talk more about what you would like to use Speaker 6 for in terms of your own personal entertainment. We can think about music, movies and trivia jokes. Speaker 6 also has many fun games or skills. That you can kind of tap into. So Speaker 2, what type of entertainment or leisure leisure activities do you like to do?\n00:00:52 Speaker 2\nMy Speaker 15 is trying to talk to you. I feel like maybe I can like, like, look at like who, like what movies are like trending in the box office? Like maybe I can go to a movie in the coming weekend or something. Maybe my Speaker 15 can tell me: Oh, check out this one or something.\n00:01:12 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below).

While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- **Patient Name:** R.T.\n- **Date:** 07-25-2024\n- **Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n- **Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses interest in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  \n- **History of Present Illness (HPI):** \n  - R.T. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who enjoys various forms of entertainment, including movies, music, and games. \n  - R.T. reports a preference for watching trending movies and enjoys the experience of going to theaters, particularly for comedies. \n  - R.T. uses a laptop and cell phone for entertainment, frequently accessing YouTube for music and social media to connect with friends. \n  - R.T. has a Spotify account for music streaming and enjoys listening to old folk and rock music while working on tasks that require concentration, such as typing for a laboratory license renewal.\n  - R.T. also enjoys watching shows like \"Wipeout\" and \"American Ninja Warrior\" for their competitive nature.\n  \n- **Current Medications:** None reported.\n  \n- **Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n- **Vital Signs:** Not assessed during the session.\n  \n- **Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Laboratory Data:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Imaging Results:** Not applicable for this session.\n  \n- **Other Diagnostic Data:** \n  - R.T. demonstrated the ability to set reminders and alarms using the voice-activated device (Speaker 15).\n  - R.T. successfully connected to Spotify and YouTube for music and video playback.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Problem 1:** Difficulty in utilizing technology for entertainment purposes.\n  - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n    - Lack of familiarity with voice-activated technology.\n    - Potential cognitive overload when managing multiple applications.\n  - **Discussion:** R.T. shows enthusiasm for using technology but may benefit from further guidance on maximizing its use for entertainment and reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Education and Training:**\n   - Continue to provide R.T. with practical demonstrations on how to use Speaker 15 for various entertainment functions, including setting reminders, playing music, and accessing videos.\n   - Encourage R.T. to create playlists on Spotify and explore YouTube for content that aligns with their interests.\n\n2. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess R.T.'s comfort level with the technology and address any challenges faced in using the device for entertainment.\n   - Encourage R.T. to practice using the device independently and report back on their experiences.\n\n3. **Patient Engagement:**\n   - Suggest R.T. explore new genres of music or shows to enhance their entertainment experience.\n   - Recommend R.T. to engage with family members or friends to share experiences and learn together about using the technology.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- R.T. appears motivated to learn and utilize technology for entertainment, indicating a positive outlook on integrating these tools into daily life.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Emphasize Therapy Session Context**: The system prompt should explicitly state that the SOAP note is being generated from a therapy session rather than a general clinical encounter. This will help the LLM focus on therapy-specific content and avoid irrelevant sections like vital signs and medications.\n\n2. **Highlight Conciseness and Focus**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to prioritize conciseness and focus on the therapy session's goals, outcomes, and specific activities. This aligns with the target note's structure and ensures that the generated note is not overly detailed with unnecessary patient information.\n\n3. **Incorporate Specific Goals and Outcomes**: The prompt should guide the LLM to include specific, quantifiable goals and outcomes related to the therapy session. This could involve setting targets for the use of voice commands with a specific accuracy percentage and cue level, as seen in the target note.\n\n4. **Relevance of Content**: The prompt should direct the LLM to exclude irrelevant sections such as vital signs and medications, focusing instead on therapy-related content. This ensures that the generated note is aligned with the session's objectives and the target note's format.\n\n5. **Use of Therapy-Specific Terminology**: The prompt should encourage the use of terminology consistent with therapy sessions, avoiding overly clinical language that does not pertain to the session's objectives. This helps in maintaining relevance and clarity in the generated note.\n\n6. **Assessment and Plan Specificity**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to provide specific details in the assessment and plan sections, including any homework assignments, strategies, or actions the patient should take. This aligns with the target note's emphasis on actionable outcomes.\n\n7. **Focus on Therapy Process and Outcomes**: The prompt should emphasize the importance of detailing the therapy process and outcomes, including the patient's performance during the session and any progress made towards therapy goals. This ensures that the generated note reflects the session's objectives and the target note's focus.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into the system prompt, the LLM can be guided to produce a SOAP note that better matches the target note's structure and objectives, thereby improving the response's alignment with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion.

T.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 4: Clinician\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n\n00:00:00 Speaker 2\nScheduling reminders and reminders and scheduling some stuff. Appointments.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nOK, very good. Alright, so have you been able to access the homework link OK. Or.\n00:00:18 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, umm the you. I have like e-mail thread from like the like. The Speaker 3 study and my e-mail. I just click it. Yeah. And I can put it, it goes up in my browser I can just type it.\n00:00:22 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:00:27 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, good. So you can, UM, I think there's some questions and then you can like record yourself.\n00:00:36 Speaker 2\nYeah, and take a video and submit.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yeah. I thought that was such a cool platform. I never worked with that. And I was like, wow, this. Is really.\n00:00:45 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:00:47 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK. Me. OK, so Speaker 2 today the topic is news and facts, so kind of talking about like asking Speaker 3 to schedule. You don't like turning on the news and telling us what's going on. Do you have any goals? In terms of. Using Speaker 3 for news and facts.\n00:01:21 Speaker 2\nIf there's like something important going on like the Olympics or like an election a couple weeks, like maybe I can ask her, like, how are the polls in California or something like that? Or I live in California, just like Orange County or something like that. And maybe, like, I can ask, like, who won the 100m? Dash to the Olympics like you know, people are like here say ohh Noah Lyles like. Like that guy? There's some other guys.\n00:01:51 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, I actually watched the documentary about Noah Lyles on Netflix, so I was, like, amazed. And then, yeah.\n00:01:59 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:02:02 Speaker 1\nDo you watch Netflix, Speaker 2?\n00:02:05 Speaker 2\nI think, well, my mom has, like, every different streaming. So like always has checked her here and there.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. There's so many Netflix documentaries now on the Olympic athletes like Simone Biles, and yeah, the sprinters and stuff. Awesome. OK. Genevieve, would you like to take it away? Is your needs OK? OK.\n00:02:31 Speaker 4\nSure. So also I was just writing in the goal and then it just got. Deleted. Oh, is it? I'm not sure. I think I just pressed something.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nAnd delete it. OK, maybe can you do undo and see if it comes back up?\n00:02:54\nIt's not.\n00:02:57 Speaker 4\nI can rewrite it.\n00:02:58 Speaker 1\nOhh that's OK I I. Got it you can proceed.\n00:03:02 Speaker 4\nOK. All right. So first we kind of you kind of just talked about it, but what type of information do you want to listen to the news floor?\n00:03:16 Speaker 2\nWell, if there's like, you know, a big event like, no, everyone's talking about or like you heard it on other platforms like social media or something. Ohh, what do you think about this Olympic racer or some kind of like running topic that, you know, sports or? Like something like, you know, people, you know, people don't wanna, like, talk about elections. But like, sometimes it comes in your head. You wanna talk about it? So maybe you can just like, maybe ask her something about like. Like you know, this year's Olympics, you may have break dancing. Maybe like we'll ask her, like, who's the women's break dancing for the US? I don't know how to.\n00:04:02 Speaker 4\nHey, that's awesome. I'm sorry. Dance.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nThe Champions? Yeah. Or maybe they're like, maybe like the athlete or whoever they want to do it, OK.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nAll right. And then what topics are you interested in discussing or learning more about, like there's cars or fishing or sports or health? Is there anything that you you wanna find out more about?\n00:04:36 Speaker 2\nWell, I like water sports, swimming and surfing.\n00:04:41 Speaker 4\nOK. Do you want to learn more about swimming and surfing? Is there anything else you want to learn more about?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nWell, like science are like recent science like.\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nLike news or like, you know, my background is in genetics like lab testing. So like you know there's like something called crisper. It's like like doing individual medicine by altering people's genes. So send this to some like the front page news. So it's like. Wow. Yeah, it's in there somewhere.\n00:05:23 Speaker 4\nSo you'd want us ask about it so that Speaker 3 could maybe expand on that. Yeah. So how would you ask that question?\n00:05:35 Speaker 2\nAlright, maybe make a call, say her name, and then say. I think. Are there not? Don't always say that I'm. Is there any news about gene editing currently or something like that?\n00:05:54 Speaker 4\nOK, great. Alright, yeah. I wish I knew more about that.\n00:06:06 Speaker 2\nI know like no. Currently there's some people who have, like, a family trait, like sickle cell anemia. They cut it as soon as they got, like, cut it out of the genome or some people they call, they get designer babies. They try to edit their baby when they when they're born they want like perfect, you know, types thing. Some people do that not me, but it's out there, right.\n00:06:36 Speaker 4\nOK. So can you think of 10 scenarios to complete the sentence? I want to ask or know more about?\n00:06:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:06:49 Speaker 4\nSo is there like 10 things you want to learn more about?\n00:06:55 Speaker 2\nI will. I want to learn more about the US break dancing team. Or Olympic break dancing team. And then maybe say. Who is the US athlete athlete in the 100m butterfly? And then. UM. Who is the? Female US Olympian in the 100 meter dash. It's running then. Are there is it? Are there any Olympic pair break break dancing? I didn't think it was this different categories and sports was like single and double so.\n00:08:02 Speaker 4\nYeah. Is there any non sports related things that you wanted to learn about?\n00:08:10 Speaker 2\nUM. Well, like you know, sometimes there's some stuff like. My son is on TV. That was like like. Well, sometimes is like a bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever's on TV. And like, they will see who it is now. It's like, it's like, want to talk about it? I'm just like, it's usually the same script, but just different guys.\n00:08:36 Speaker 4\nRight, yeah. Been up to date.\n00:08:40 Speaker 2\nYeah, she would like. Ohh. Like shows like that.\n00:08:46 Speaker 4\nOK. Anything else?\n00:08:55 Speaker 2\nMaybe I can ask her to. Maybe like what is the biggest like is it the front page news in the LA Times or something like big newspaper or New York Times or like? There's different news on the East Coast and the West Coast and different topics I used to live back east for college, and sometimes they paid for weather. It's like this long and like there's something called sleep.\n00:09:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nSure.\n00:09:32 Speaker 4\nWell, yeah, I think if you asked that for today, then every day it would change. So you'd be able to stay up on the neighbors.\n00:09:39 Speaker 2\nNews up to date, yeah.\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nThat's great. Is there anything else that you that you think you want to learn more about?\n00:09:50 Speaker 2\nUhm. Maybe I can ask her to say, like what? The weather is in my town. Or like, where my sister lives or my cousins live in, say, maybe wanna check in with. I'm gonna go with it later. I can check the weather first or something.\n00:10:11 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah, those are great topics that we can look at. Are you someone that likes to keep up on what's going on?\n00:10:21 Speaker 2\nYes, cause sometimes this phone talks to you, like mention it or just like what? But you need to be up to date.\n00:10:35 Speaker 1\nAwesome. OK. So Speaker 2, so I get you are very interested in sports such as swimming and maybe break dancing and and surfing water sports. Awesome.\n00:10:50 Speaker 2\nAnd also surfing. Yeah, I like modern sports. I like.\n00:10:58 Speaker 1\nOh, maybe for surfing. Is there anything that you're particularly interested in asking Speaker 3 about surfing?\n00:11:07 Speaker 2\nUM. Well. I was was like trying to. I think they have two athletes of different genders. I know that one of the girls is called Caroline Marks. I don't really know who the other surfer is. Maybe I'll ask her who they both are or something.\n00:11:26 Speaker 1\nOK, looks good. So who are the surf athletes?\n00:11:34 Speaker 2\nOhh, the Olympics are maybe the Olympic female surf athletes are are maybe US Olympics.\n00:11:47 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK, OK. And then the last thing we want to see and check on Speaker 2 is just how you create. Remember, last week we learned about creating a medication list. Do you still remember the command that you would use to? First create the medication list. On your Speaker 3 device.\n00:12:12 Speaker 2\nYou. Ask her for. Remember, it's like if you ask for. A list or something? Really reminder and you say I want and you add like either I type it or say like I want to add like. Like my two like like ohh my anti seizure meds and like Tylenol and and a couple of things, yeah.\n00:12:37 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So and. But in order to create that list, we would just say, Speaker 3, create a medication list. So do you want to go ahead and try that?\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nIt's called medication. What should I add to it?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nHe just woke up. Keppra.\n00:12:55 Speaker 3\nWe already have a list called medication.\n00:13:01 Speaker 2\nSo I ask, can you add Keppra?\n00:13:08 Speaker 3\nI've added Keppra to your medication list. What else can I add for you?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nCan you add Lamotrigine?\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nI've added Lamotrigine to your medication list. What other items do you? Want to end them? \n00:13:19 Speaker 2\nNone.\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:13:30 Speaker 2\nI did it, added my medicine.\n00:13:31 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nAnd even though there's some some other stuff they added to like like last time I added Tylenol and Pepto Bismol.\n00:13:43 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yeah. So you're just able to add to it. Very good.\n00:13:47 Speaker 2\nYeah, they say making marks like print, yeah.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nAnd then, uh, Speaker 2, would you continue to add to the medication list? Uh. I mean, would you like, as you know, the weeks go on not right now, but.\n00:14:07 Speaker 2\nYeah, like, well, if maybe my my neurologist puts you on a different medicine, I would have to change them out. And maybe I go on like. Maybe I'll switch from Tylenol to Advil and switch it up.\n00:14:22 Speaker 1\nUp. Yeah, I like that.\n00:14:26 Speaker 2\nSome people, some people like, really have a big choice and it's like. They feel good to me.\n00:14:33 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yes. I like that. Yeah, you're just just making it like up to date and current. Yeah.\n00:14:47 Speaker 2\nSometimes like, either my pharmacy wants to switch it up or my my neuro psych my I have a neurologist and a neuro psych. Sometimes they give me. Kind of a different list like what time do you go to my pharmacy? I have to get them both.\n00:15:07 Speaker 3\nThat's true.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nAnd then. OK, I think we're pretty much done. OK. Unless there's anything I'm missing.\n00:15:24 Speaker 4\nGenevieve, I don't. I'm lucky. I don't think so. I think that was. That was. Ohh, I was gonna ask so you said that your neurologist was changing up your medications, so.\n00:15:44 Speaker 2\nYeah, he was like it. Kind of like stepping down the amount of one pill and making the other one go up because it hadn't phase out one that was on early in my recovery. Now putting me more of one newer pill. I'm switching them out right now.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nSo you mentioned that you were maybe gonna change use Speaker 3 to change the reminders.\n00:16:10 Speaker 2\nYeah. Because like my dosage of this pill called Keppra is going down my pill range for this lamotrigine is going up so that he's going facing. Now one in yeah.\n00:16:24 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah.\n00:16:27 Speaker 1\nVery nice. OK. Yeah.\n00:16:35 Speaker 2\nLet's.\n00:16:35 Speaker 1\nSee. I think I wonder if others are. Done. If should we go to the main room and just wait for the rest of the groups?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 2, did you used to actually surf or do you just watch it?\n00:17:08 Speaker 2\nUmm well, like before my accident. I am. I would like you know when you surf. I would get the little ones like down in Doheny or the little ways, like two or two feet like little ones. And just like, ride them to shore. It's really easy, but it's fun.\n00:17:29 Speaker 1\nThat's. Looks awesome. Ohh yeah Bolsa Chica. I've heard of that beach. It's quite famous.\n00:17:34 Speaker 2\nIt's it's, it's famous and also like Bohemia's famous too. They're both name beaches, but they're like easy to access and they're off right off PCH. Yeah.\n00:17:37 Speaker 1\nYeah. Ohh. Nice. Yeah, that's really cool. Speaker 2, do you still like to go to the beach on your off days?\n00:17:59 Speaker 2\nWell, sometimes like. My my friends, the State Guard and sometimes she I'm trying to get reintroduced. Being in the water like she in the past, she would tell me to swim with her from tower to Tower. But like I'm just kind of I'm reintroduce myself to water cause like earlier this year at UM, some seizures, so when you go back in the waves do not want to have that happen. So, like need to reintroduce myself. That's why I'm in my community pool, doing some either treading water or trying to do some little half laps. So it's all in like working my head need to make it. Work.\n00:18:44 Speaker 1\nYes, you will definitely, yeah.\n00:18:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, I want to push myself.\n00:18:48 Speaker 1\nYeah. Has Speaker 3 been pretty good at reminding you about your physical therapy appointment?\n00:18:54 Speaker 2\nYes, because I have her one of my one of my alarms is I want to have I set it for like different days of the week. My PT's are always on Wednesday, so she has alarm for. Time to go and reminder like 20 minutes before so you know your PT outfit is different than just they hang out. Alpha is like my PT. My clinician is or my PT doctor said he knew where leg and stretch you out so. To change.\n00:19:26 Speaker 1\nOhh wow yeah. That's good. And then you have enough time to, like, put your hair up and.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nBecause like well before PT, I need to have it in a bun or back cause like. One of the things well, I'm tall and also I got a lot of hair. So like sometimes my my PT, he\u2019s like you need to tie that back.\n00:19:53 Speaker 1\nSo they tell you.\n00:19:54 Speaker 2\nYeah, like UM. They're like, that's their job, physical therapy? They need to stretch me out, and if this is in the way we need to put it back.\n00:20:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense, yeah. All right, so I think. We are going to close the breakout rooms in a second, so we'll meet each other back.\n00:20:17 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:20:32 Speaker 1\nAnd I'm excited to get to well, we're going to come back in our breakout rooms, but I'm excited for towards the end asking Speaker 3 and Speaker 2 having you ask Speaker 3 some of these questions that you were curious about. So.\n00:20:56 Speaker 4\nIs it gonna automatically? Close or do we need to leave?\n00:21:01 Speaker 1\nOh, oh, there we go.\n00:21:02 Speaker 2\nMy phone to me now.\n00:21:03 Speaker 1\nYes. All right. I'll see you back there.\n00:21:06 Speaker 2\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:21:19 Speaker 4\nHi. Hi.\n00:21:22 Speaker 2\nHi guys again.\n00:21:24 Speaker 1\nHello. OK, I will share my screen again and then. We can continue. All right, Speaker 2, do you see the screen?\n00:21:38 Speaker 2\nAs I can this is 2 commands. The person says her name start flash briefing.\n00:21:45\nMHM.\n00:21:46 Speaker 2\nThen second one stop. OK. So do you want me to ask it?\n00:21:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, yes. Yeah. Go ahead. Actually, I can play it on a slideshow. So you can do that one first and then Yep.\n00:22:01 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Start flash briefing.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:22:21 Speaker 2\nWright brothers.\n00:22:27 Speaker 3\nFrom Post reports.\n00:22:31 Speaker 3\nAs you've probably heard us talk about on the show, The Washington Post has a big team covering the Paris Olympics. They're following all the highlights and what's happening behind the scenes.\n00:22:43 Speaker 2\nThey just switched me over to like, like no news about the Paris Olympics. Going on right now.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nOhh very cool. Yeah, so it didn't. It didn't keep on going and going.\n00:22:55 Speaker 2\nNo, I just like just switching out right away, yeah.\n00:22:57 Speaker 1\nWith this thought. Oh, wow. OK, so you don't have to say stop because.\n00:23:02 Speaker 2\nNo, it's they kept on going. But I'm saying as long.\n00:23:08 Speaker 1\nOhh so did you stop it?\n00:23:09 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, hit the little stop button because it said it said 27 minutes. I'm not gonna wait.\n00:23:17 Speaker 1\nWow. OK, very good, very good. OK, let's go on to the next one then. OK, so this one is kind of like knowing what's going on in your own personal calendar. So, Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try this one?\n00:23:42 Speaker 2\nOK.

Yeah, you need to re put them in here after, after, right after our session to update it for next week.\n00:24:07 Speaker 1\nSo if there's nothing on your calendar, do you want to try making an event for something?\n00:24:12 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Speaker 3, can you make an event for tomorrow morning at 11:00 AM?\n00:24:26 Speaker 3\nOK. And what's the name of the event?\n00:24:29 Speaker 2\nSaint Jude's therapy network.\n00:24:32 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:24:39 Speaker 2\nShe just added something to my calendar.\n00:24:41 Speaker 1\nNice success. Are there any? Are there any other events that that you want to add to Speaker 3?\n00:24:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's.\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:25:06 Speaker 3\nAnd one way that I've been keeping up on. All of it is. By listening to the posts pop up.\n00:25:12 Speaker 2\nThe poses kept on going. Maybe we can add some more events to my calendar.\n00:25:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, let's try one more.\n00:25:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, can I have? Can I schedule an event for Monday morning?

On Monday, August 12th, at 11:00 AM, there's doctor Bellucci.\n00:26:31 Speaker 1\nNice six of this.\n00:26:32 Speaker 2\nBut it's like, you know, coming out like those are my most current appointments here.\n00:26:39 Speaker 1\nExactly. Yeah, I'm glad. OK. She is responding. Yes, very up to date. Awesome. OK, Genevieve, go ahead and and kind of take over.\n00:26:43 Speaker 2\nUp to date right now.\n00:26:56 Speaker 4\nSure. Umm. So let's look at some uh news. So can you read the command?\n00:27:03 Speaker 2\nOK, it says her name. Who is running for president? Who was running for president to ask her?\n00:27:14 Speaker 4\nYeah. So you can go ahead and ask her this.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'll do this training, OK. Speaker 3, who is running for president.\n00:27:26 Speaker 3\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior. Jill Stein, Cornell West and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:27:56 Speaker 2\nThat was kind of up to date.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nI do not know that did.\n00:27:57 Speaker 4\nYeah. I didn't even know that. Did you know about Speaker 2?\n00:28:02 Speaker 1\nVery cool.\n00:28:06 Speaker 2\nWell, like I heard about like the top two, like Kamala and Trump. And then like, I learned about. RFK Junior and then. They're only those three, but there's some other ones there's learn about right now.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nCast this moment hosted by my colleague Eva Wall.\n00:28:25 Speaker 4\nThat's great.\n00:28:31 Speaker 1\nAlright, OK, next is. MHM.\n00:28:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Do you want me to ask her?\n00:28:43 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah, let's go ahead. So you can ask Speaker 3 about, yeah, just like current events.\n00:28:51 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. When is the election?\n00:28:57 Speaker 3\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:29:14 Speaker 2\nIt's OK. It's like well, it's November 5th. That's in like three months.\n00:29:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.\n00:29:27 Speaker 2\nBut like, you know, usually like the two months before, it's like everywhere. And the news is like this, this.\n00:29:36 Speaker 4\nDo you? Do you have any? Like follow up questions that would be related to the election?\n00:29:45 Speaker 3\nOn today's episode of the Sports moments, David.\n00:29:49 Speaker 2\nI would just probably ask. Maybe the local election questions like in California, like who's gonna be the governor or something like that.\n00:30:00 Speaker 4\nOK, you want to try asking her that?\n00:30:07 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Who is running for Governor of California?\n00:30:15 Speaker 3\nThe candidates in the 2022 California election for governor were Gavin Newsom and Brian Dahl.\n00:30:24 Speaker 2\nOhh, there's two guys running for it, you know. They knew some of this other guy.\n00:30:31 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:30:33 Speaker 2\nSome guy called Brian Brian Dahl learned about it today.\n00:30:41 Speaker 4\nDo you know anything about them? Either of them?\n00:30:45 Speaker 2\nWell, like Gavin Newsom was our previous governor, he's like going to be running again, and this this other guy and put him in the Internet too, happens.\n00:30:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:30:57 Speaker 4\nSo you could put it in the Internet, or you could even ask. More questions maybe if you're not sure what you're going to vote.\n00:31:06 Speaker 3\nDan Zac, who was covering the.\n00:31:09 Speaker 2\nI could just ask her and. That's why that guy.\n00:31:16 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:31:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Should we go on to the next one? That was great.\n00:31:29 Speaker 1\nAlright, let's ask this, OK.\n00:31:37 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is interesting now?\n00:31:46 Speaker 3\nWelcome to what's interesting now. Each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Irvine from Los Angeles Times.\n00:32:03 Speaker 3\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig in Tahiti resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his surfing correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:32:21 Speaker 3\nFrom Los Angeles.\n00:32:22 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:32:23 Speaker 3\nThe British rock icon rock.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nThey're just doing on different news articles about.\n00:32:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you can tell Speaker 3 to stop anytime. Or. Yeah. Yeah, I think you just click.\n00:32:36 Speaker 2\nAre you just hit the little pause? Yeah, they're just right now. They were just going to, you know, the old Rod Stewart was like.\n00:32:38 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:32:45 Speaker 2\nI'm not old for that. Yeah. Because it says that Rod Stewart is.\n00:32:57 Speaker 3\nA cultural event.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nNow his biggest relevancy is his illness. Learned about that today.\n00:33:10 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2, there is another command that I can. Sorry, excuse me. There's another command that I can kind of. Teach you it's uh, I think it's like Speaker 3, what's the story? And do you want to try that? I don't know if it'll give you if that also is a skill that might give you some stories or I don't know how it's going to respond, but do you want? To try that one.\n00:33:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what is the story?\n00:33:48 Speaker 3\nA narrative story or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional or fictional.\n00:34:00 Speaker 1\nOK, sorry, I think I think.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nYeah, but. A different word.\n00:34:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, when I. Speaker 3 sometimes prompts can prompt you, so if she's talking about a certain news like headline, yeah, you can ask. What's the story? And then she'll kind of elaborate more on it.\n00:34:23 Speaker 2\nMore detail, OK.\n00:34:24 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So I think that's when it will be appropriate to use that one. Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right, let's go on to. The next one, no. All right. Sorry. Go ahead. Send a beep. OK.\n00:34:43 Speaker 4\nOK. So yeah, we can kind of see what it's like in your area or even like how we did in the other you can, you know, ask this question or ask for different areas. But why don't we start by trying this command?\n00:35:01 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'm asking. Speaker 3. What's the traffic like?\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:35:18 Speaker 2\nWell, she wants my work address.\n00:35:20 Speaker 3\nOK, currently, traffic on your commute looks good. The fastest route takes about one minute via Sierra Cello Rd.\n00:35:48 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah my work and where I am now is the same place. It's it's one minute comes.\n00:36:00 Speaker 4\nAnother thing that you could ask like when I used to drive in commute, I would drive on the 5 freeway, would even ask what's the traffic like on the 5 freeway or another freeway that you take a lot.\n00:36:16 Speaker 2\nAlright so. I'm gonna ask her, OK? Speaker 3, what is the traffic on the 405 freeway right now?\n00:36:28 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:33 Speaker 2\nOK, Speaker 3. What's the traffic like on the 405 freeway?\n00:36:41 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:46 Speaker 4\nI don't think she likes that command.\n00:36:48 Speaker 2\nNo, but like I live closer to the 405 than the five, but.\n00:36:54 Speaker 4\nYeah, maybe we could, I can look and see if I can figure out how. To reword it to ask about that, maybe next time.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, probably next time.\n00:37:07 Speaker 4\nLet's see. OK. All right, so this one, you can kind of look into some exercises, so let's try asking about this exercise.\n00:37:23 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK. Speaker 3. What are exercises for lower back pain?\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHere's something I found on reference.com partial crunches. Hamstring stretches, walls sits and bridging are four exercises that can improve lower back pain dot regular weight lifting and aerobic exercise such as walking, biking or running are also helpful. But people should stop these exercises if they cause any pain. For people who experience.\n00:38:06 Speaker 2\nShe listed, she listed it off. A good list of things like, you know, your lower back is like a big. Part of it, yeah, overall health. So you were standing up straight is always good.\n00:38:20 Speaker 4\nYeah. And you could even try this with, you know, other pain that you get too. Like, if you get pain in you know your neck or something like that. You could you could. Try that as well.\n00:38:31 Speaker 2\nAsk her for that. Yeah, because, like sometimes. Like my like the size of my neck scent is. My PT my PT says you're stiff. You stretch it out.\n00:38:46 Speaker 4\nYeah. All right, let's try one more.\n00:38:54 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:38:58 Speaker 4\nOK, so why don't you go ahead and ask this one?\n00:39:07 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:39:14 Speaker 3\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 3 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:39:32 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, you know this town, Olympia, maybe it's a real place.\n00:39:40 Speaker 1\nIt probably is, yeah.\n00:39:42 Speaker 2\nOver there.\n00:39:45 Speaker 1\nUh, this is actually a good segway. Speaker 2, do you want to ask a couple questions that you were actually genuinely curious about? Like the questions you were telling us earlier?\n00:39:58 Speaker 2\nRight.\n00:39:59 Speaker 1\nSo I yeah, I think they were. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sure you have them. It was about break dancing teams or like the other. The Surf, surf, athletes, anything that comes to mind.\n00:40:14 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. Who are the US Olympic female surfers?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nFrom surfacefootprint.com. The Olympic medal favorites in the male surfing event are John John Florence and Kolohe Andino, and the Olympic medal favorites in the female surfing event are Carissa Moon and Caroline Marks from the USA.\n00:40:46 Speaker 2\nWell, they gave me an overall answer, but the girls were on there like Caroline and this other girl. So even though the list of the boys too is like I know them.\n00:40:59 Speaker 4\nNow that's great.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nVery good. \n00:41:07 Speaker 2\nYeah. It's good for me.  It's like I hear them again, like if I'm in my room at night. She says something though. Need to be up to date.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nPlease have fun. Alright, so we are. Yeah, we're going to go back to the main room, but great job today. Speaker 2. I think I learned a lot.\n00:41:24 Speaker 2\nWe are all learning.\n00:41:29 Speaker 1\nThanks for your questions. Yeah.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time.

This could involve guiding the LLM to quantify the patient's progress, such as the number of successful interactions with Alexa or the percentage of tasks completed using the device.\n\n4. **Detail Engagement with Topics:**\n   - The prompt should encourage the LLM to provide a detailed account of the patient's engagement with specific topics, such as the Olympics and elections. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to focus on the patient's interests and the depth of their engagement with these topics in the Subjective section.\n\n5. **Outline Homework and Strategies:**\n   - The system prompt should guide the LLM to include specific homework and strategies for future sessions. This could involve adding a directive to identify and document any assignments or strategies that will support the patient's progress, ensuring these are clearly outlined in the Plan section.\n\n6. **Ensure Consistency Across Sections:**\n   - The prompt should emphasize the importance of maintaining consistency across all sections of the SOAP note. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to balance the focus between technology use, medication management, and the patient's specific goals and interests, ensuring each section aligns with the target note's content and focus.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into the system prompt, the LLM can be better guided to produce a SOAP note that aligns with the target note, thereby improving the response and achieving a closer match with the desired output.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Individual training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver \nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A. \nSpeaker 3: Clinician \nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa \nSpeaker 5: Clinician \nSpeaker 6: Clinician \nSpeaker 7: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver \nSpeaker 8: Clinician\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nWe did the. Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and better align the language model's output with the objective function, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Emphasize Session-Specific Details**: The system prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to focus on capturing session-specific details, such as the involvement of M.A.'s mother, the specific commands practiced, and the dynamics of the interaction. This can be achieved by including a directive to prioritize the inclusion of these elements in the SOAP note.\n\n2. **Highlight Interaction Dynamics**: The prompt should guide the LLM to pay particular attention to the interaction dynamics between M.A., his mother, and the clinician. This includes recognizing the role of verbal cues, support, and prompting provided by M.A.'s mother. By emphasizing these aspects, the LLM can produce a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the session.\n\n3. **Reduce Clinical Analysis Focus**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to minimize the emphasis on clinical analysis, such as differential diagnoses and structured plans, unless explicitly relevant to the session. Instead, the focus should be on practical aspects, such as the specific commands practiced and the homework assignments given.\n\n4. **Incorporate Homework Assignments**: The system prompt should remind the LLM to include any homework assignments or follow-up actions discussed during the session. This ensures that the generated note provides a complete picture of the session's objectives and future steps.\n\n5. **Align with Target Note Structure**: The prompt should guide the LLM to closely follow the structure and content of the target note. This includes providing a clear framework for organizing the SOAP note, ensuring that all relevant details from the session are captured accurately.\n\n6. **Encourage Consistency and Focus**: The prompt should emphasize the importance of maintaining consistency in content and focus with the target note. This involves ensuring that all relevant details are present and that the note accurately reflects the session's dynamics and objectives.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt can better guide the LLM's reasoning strategy, resulting in a more accurate and aligned SOAP note that meets the objective function effectively.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

So we're gonna go over some questions related to self-care and medical needs today. So first of all, though, we're going to do a little review of the last week's comments. So you're going to show me how you can play music, play music, or a video of your choice with your Speaker 4 device. So you want to go ahead and do that? Speaker 2, do you want to give it a command?\n00:00:37 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you play? A video from. January 3rd. OK.\n00:00:56 Speaker 1\nDoes it? Is it playing anything?\n00:00:58 Speaker 3\nYes it is.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:01:00 Speaker 3\nI hooked up Speaker 2's apple music. To the elect. Don't ask me how I did it, but. I figured it out. OK. We did hook it up and he's been able. He's been using that feature a lot, he'll say, play Bon Jovi or and it will just start playing a. Yeah. Bunch of Bon Jovi songs.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK. So when?\n00:01:27 Speaker 3\nBut I do have a question.\n00:01:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, go ahead. Yeah.\n00:01:31 Speaker 3\nThat just turn it off, Speaker 2.\n00:01:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:38 Speaker 3\nLouder.\n00:01:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:01:42 Speaker 3\nIt's muted. That's fine.\n00:01:43 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:48 Speaker 3\nIn in relation to the music, Speaker 2 listens to a radio station in the mornings. It's a KC 790.\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nUh-huh.\n00:01:59 Speaker 3\nSo is there a way to hook that up as well?\n00:02:04 Speaker 1\nThere should be actually.\n00:02:08 Speaker 3\nAnd if not, I believe the show he listens to is on that iheart app. So I don't, I do, we don't have that either, but I those are that was part part one and we could hook it up then it would be the same way. Part 2 is Speaker 2 gets books from. Guard. Which is for from Berlin Institute their books. It's a reading library and you choose your books on Bard and then you can play. Listen to your books. Is it possible to hook that up to Speaker 4 or should it just be YouTube? On YouTube you can actually listen to all kinds of stories as well.\n00:02:51 Speaker 1\nRight, so I'm pretty. Sure that the audible, I I don't know if you know there's a there's a website called Audible which has audible books. I'm pretty sure that can be hooked up to Speaker 4. I am not very sure about about the board. OK. But I can check and let you know about that one. Yeah, I I can research a little bit and maybe maybe get back to you is it called Bard Bard.\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOhh OK. Correct. OK. It's rail institute.\n00:03:25 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK, alright, let me check I I almost wonder if if it could be. Synced into your phone. And because your phones Speaker 4 is synced in with the Speaker 4 on the Echo. So if it could be played on the phone, it could be played on here, but I will check and let.\n00:03:44 Speaker 4\nUh-huh.\n00:03:51 Speaker 1\nYou know for sure.\n00:03:52 Speaker 3\nOK. And just so you know, I put the Bard app is on his iPad and I put the Speaker 4 app on the iPad.\n00:03:58 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nAnd they're both and. The pad is linked to the.\n00:04:02 Speaker 1\nPhone, phone. Perfect. So, alright. OK. I can. I can look that up for sure. One was the Bard and then other one was the.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nOh.\n00:04:11 Speaker 1\nMusic. You said. No. What? What was that?\n00:04:13 Speaker 3\nAt the radio station, it's OK.\n00:04:15 Speaker 1\nRadio station about yes.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nAt K ABC 790 OK Yeah 790.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nABC.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAll right. So all right, those are very specific questions, so.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nI didn't. Well, we're we're trying.\n00:04:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, no, that's perfect. But so Speaker 2, I had a question. So when you said Speaker 4 play a video from January 3rd, what did it bring up? Did it, was it anything specific that what what did was that the command that he that you gave?\n00:04:48 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what command did you give?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nJust command.\n00:04:53 Speaker 3\nCan you repeat it? Yeah. What was it?\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nYou like to play. New memory from January 3rd.\n00:05:03 Speaker 3\nA memory from January.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\n3rd memory OK, play a memory from OK. So did it. What did it bring up? I'm just curious.\n00:05:14 Speaker 3\nIt did. It was a video and then the music started playing.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nFor you.\n00:05:20 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK. All right, but. Very nice, Speaker 2. I mean, I'm, I'm so impressed. All right, so.\n00:05:31 Speaker 4\nThat for you.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:05:34 Speaker 1\nAll right, perfect. All right, Speaker 2. So let's move over to this week's topic. What type? So I have a few questions I want to ask you. First, initially to 1st ASK is is like what is your goal when it comes to self-care and medical needs? Using Speaker 4, what would you say your goal is?\n00:06:02 Speaker 3\nFor health and medical needs, Speaker 2 to use Speaker 4.\n00:06:04 Speaker 2\nHow's the mass on each? Here. Brushing my teeth.\n00:06:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright. What did you what? What else did you say?\n00:06:23 Speaker 3\nTrimming his nails.\n00:06:25 Speaker 1\nOK, trimming the nails. Perfect. Alright. Anything else you can think of?\n00:06:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, eating breakfast.\n00:06:36 Speaker 1\nCorrect. So eating meals on time?\n00:06:39 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:06:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n00:07:07 Speaker 3\nAre you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:07:16 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n00:07:40 Speaker 2\nMy iPhone.\n00:07:42 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n00:07:56 Speaker 3\nAre you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n00:08:00 Speaker 2\nMaking reminders on the iPhone.\n00:08:04 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nSo OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n00:08:50 Speaker 3\nIf I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n00:09:06 Speaker 1\nGot it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n00:10:11 Speaker 2\nSo I can. Make goals.\n00:10:17 Speaker 3\nMake goals.\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:21 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n00:11:00 Speaker 3\nWould you like her to remind you?\n00:11:04 Speaker 3\nTo eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n00:11:12 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:11:15 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nBrushing my teeth.\n00:11:37 Speaker 3\nBrushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n00:11:40 Speaker 1\nAll right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n00:12:13 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n00:12:27 Speaker 1\nYours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nThe same right? And that makes like more.\n00:12:49 Speaker 1\nYou think of that, Speaker 2?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nThat's a good idea.\n00:12:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n00:13:59 Speaker 3\nFair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n00:14:13 Speaker 4\nMHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nThat'd be good. OK.\n00:14:21 Speaker 3\nBecause I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n00:14:31 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:14:31 Speaker 3\nWould be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n00:14:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n00:14:54 Speaker 3\nOK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n00:15:09 Speaker 1\nUh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n00:15:12 Speaker 3\nA barred book is what I'm thinking.\n00:15:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n00:15:25 Speaker 3\nOh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n00:15:42 Speaker 1\nYou know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n00:16:19 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n00:16:21 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n00:16:40 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:16:42 Speaker 1\nI almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n00:16:46 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:16:47 Speaker 1\nThe device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n00:16:50 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:17:08 Speaker 1\nBecause there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n00:17:19 Speaker 3\nWell, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n00:17:26 Speaker 1\nThat's all.\n00:17:31 Speaker 3\nFeel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n00:17:35 Speaker 1\nThat would be great.\n00:17:35 Speaker 3\nCould behind.\n00:17:38 Speaker 1\nThat would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n00:17:44 Speaker 3\nOK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n00:17:52 Speaker 1\nOhh OK Speaker 2.\n00:17:57 Speaker 3\nThey were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n00:18:05 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:18:08 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:18:08 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:18:11 Speaker 3\nThere. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n00:18:15 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:18:16 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n00:18:41 Speaker 1\nYeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n00:18:49 Speaker 3\nBut an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n00:18:53 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:18:55 Speaker 3\nDo I just say to open the bar app?\n00:18:59 Speaker 1\nYeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n00:19:03 Speaker 3\nOK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n00:19:25 Speaker 1\nNo, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n00:19:57 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nSearching for the.\n00:20:04 Speaker 3\nBard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n00:20:12 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:20:14 Speaker 4\nCouncil.\n00:20:15 Speaker 1\nIs there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n00:21:05 Speaker 4\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n00:21:08 Speaker 3\nOK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n00:21:18 Speaker 4\nSearching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n00:21:19 Speaker 3\nIt's not understanding the bars.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nThat's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n00:21:26 Speaker 3\nMaybe yeah.\n00:21:29 Speaker 1\nAnother another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n00:21:59 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:02 Speaker 1\nTo.\n00:22:04 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n00:22:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n00:22:25 Speaker 3\nNope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nIs Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n00:22:46 Speaker 3\nNo, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nIt's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n00:22:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nIt's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n00:23:15 Speaker 3\nI'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n00:23:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n00:23:48 Speaker 4\nMy.\n00:23:52 Speaker 1\nAlright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n00:24:20 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:24:21 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n00:24:46 Speaker 3\nThe breakout room.\n00:24:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:24:48 Speaker 3\nOK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n00:24:51 Speaker 1\nAbsolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- \nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 2.\n00:25:10 Speaker 2\nHey, what's up?\n00:25:12 Speaker 1\nAlright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n00:25:50 Speaker 3\nUnmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n00:26:07 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:26:11 Speaker 3\nOK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n00:26:12 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Could.\n00:26:21 Speaker 1\nOK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:28 Speaker 2\nOK. Thank you.\n00:26:30 Speaker 3\nGo ahead.\n00:26:31 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:44 Speaker 4\nI've checked off oranges from medication.\n00:26:47 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:26:49 Speaker 1\nOhh did it say check off?\n00:26:49 Speaker 3\nAnd. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n00:26:55 Speaker 1\nNo longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n00:27:25 Speaker 2\nIbuprofen.\n00:27:27 Speaker 1\nOK, well you have been.\n00:27:28 Speaker 3\nWhat's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n00:27:38 Speaker 2\nTypical.\n00:27:39 Speaker 3\nOK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n00:27:42 Speaker 2\nEvery day.\n00:27:43 Speaker 3\nAt what time? In the morning it's at.\n00:27:53 Speaker 2\n7:30.\n00:27:55 Speaker 3\nOK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n00:28:00 Speaker 1\nOK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n00:28:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n00:28:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n00:28:22 Speaker 3\n10.\n00:28:23 Speaker 1\n7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to take Depakote at 7:30 AM tomorrow.\n00:28:42 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:47 Speaker 1\nOK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n00:29:09 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:29:10 Speaker 1\nOK, let's do that command.\n00:29:15 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n00:29:31 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n00:29:36 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n00:30:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:30:29 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away on Canyon Way, right? A 1.4 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite 110, Walgreens 2.3 miles away on Haven Ave. you can ask me for things like what's the phone number for the first one?\n00:30:51 Speaker 1\nOK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n00:31:04 Speaker 3\nIf that makes sense.\n00:31:07 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n00:31:49 Speaker 3\nJust so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nRight, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n00:32:08 Speaker 3\nJust so you. You had a heads up and. So you you know what?\n00:32:13 Speaker 1\nI mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n00:32:45 Speaker 3\nHe didn't.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I do my laundry?\n00:32:59 Speaker 1\nDid it pick it up?\n00:33:01 Speaker 3\nIt it's showing it's. A video and pictures and a lot of words on how to do it. Let me just make sure the volumes up, yeah, the volumes 3/4.\n00:33:14 Speaker 1\nOh, OK.\n00:33:16 Speaker 3\nIt picked it up but it. I don't know if my cord. Will reach the camera.\n00:33:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Is it is it more visual? Maybe like rather than ohh it's like a very text. It's all.\n00:33:30 Speaker 3\nIt's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n00:33:36 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n00:33:59 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Give me the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:12 Speaker 3\nIt's doing the same thing, the same thing. Try tell me how to do laundry that way you're telling her to? Read it to. You.\n00:34:21 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:34:22 Speaker 3\nSorry again, Speaker 2.\n00:34:25 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Hey, Speaker 4. Tell me how to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:40 Speaker 3\nIt's written again. It's written again. OK, OK, directions. Speaker 2.\n00:34:50 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me the directions to do my laundry.\n00:34:58 Speaker 4\nAt the moment, traffic to vineyards marketplace cleaners at 11460 Canyon Way looks pretty clear.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nOhh it's giving like.\n00:35:05 Speaker 4\nJust about 3 minutes via Canyon with her place.\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's a.\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nYeah. It's like a laundromat. Probably gets. Right. OK, alright. Alright, let's try another one. OK, let's try this set reminder to do laundry. Maybe that's a function more functional one. I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n00:35:54 Speaker 2\nM. OK.\n00:35:57 Speaker 3\nGo.\n00:35:58 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to. Do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:05 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:36:07 Speaker 2\nTo do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:11 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:36:12 Speaker 2\nTomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:20 Speaker 4\nIs that 5:00? In the morning or in the afternoon.\n00:36:22 Speaker 2\nIn the afternoon.\n00:36:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.\n00:36:32 Speaker 1\nBye. Purpose. OK, good job. Does these kind of reminders help Speaker 2? Maybe. That would be more functional in the real life, you think.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 1\nAlright, yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. When I asked Speaker 2, I was cooking and I asked him to set the timer for me and that was very optional. Yes.\n00:36:57 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, that is great.\n00:37:01 Speaker 3\nAnd she even told. Speaker 4, to set my mom at the time.\n00:37:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. So. OK. OK. All right, so getting stains out of clothes. What else?\n00:37:19 Speaker 3\nOK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n00:37:21 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n00:37:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:37:44 Speaker 3\nWhat?\n00:37:44 Speaker 2\nWhat do I use to get a stain out of my clothes?\n00:37:52 Speaker 4\nTo remove stains from clothes, rinse the stain with cold water and scrub it with the brush and soap. If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in cold water and soak for an hour. Then wash the clothing as usual.\n00:38:06 Speaker 3\nThis one showed the words in paragraph as well as Reddit.\n00:38:11 Speaker 1\nThat's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n00:38:18 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:38:37 Speaker 1\nText. But. I almost wonder for the laundry part. If we'd ask her to give me the first step to do my laundry or something like that.\n00:38:51 Speaker 3\nYeah. Try that, Speaker 2.\n00:38:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you give me the first step to do my laundry?\n00:39:06 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:39:08 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n00:39:41 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:39:41 Speaker 3\nI think that was the paragraph that she didn't read before.\n00:39:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, but it read. It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n00:40:20 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:40:24 Speaker 1\nDo you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n00:40:48 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. When do I use the fabric softener?\n00:40:57 Speaker 4\nAccording to an Speaker 4 Answers contributor. Add fabric softener to the wash during the rinse cycle.\n00:41:05 Speaker 1\nOK. All right.\n00:41:08 Speaker 3\nMakes sense?\n00:41:09 Speaker 1\nOK, I think this is pretty functional here. So Speaker 2 say that you have a headache and you need some answers on how to treat it on your own. So you're going to say the wake word and say, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:32 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:42 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for a migraine include applying ice packs to the back of the neck, forehead or temples, taking a nap, taking a warm shower or bath, massage, drinking water resting in a low lit room, or physical therapy.\n00:42:00 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. OK. All right, let's do the same for stomach pains. OK, so say you have a sudden stomach pain and you want to know what remedies you can use. So you're going to say the wake word. And what do I take for stomach pains? Ready. Cool.\n00:42:27 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:35 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:42:38 Speaker 4\nHuh.\n00:42:40 Speaker 1\nInteresting. Let me try that one more time, OK. On mine, Speaker 4, mute. What do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:55 Speaker 4\nI don't know that one.\n00:42:58 Speaker 1\nIt says the same thing for me too.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nOh wow.\n00:43:02 Speaker 1\nYeah. So we'll have to try that one one more time.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n00:43:14 Speaker 1\nOK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n00:43:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:43:27 Speaker 1\nUh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:09 Speaker 3\nWhat kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:20 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. All Star physical therapy 3.1 miles away on Rochester Ave. Suite 110, team Physical therapy, 3 miles away on Town Center. Dr. Rancho San Antonio Rehab Center, 2.3 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite G30.\n00:44:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n00:45:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's.\n00:45:21 Speaker 2\nYeah it does.\n00:45:24 Speaker 1\nOK, I think we are through with the slides. Let me stop sharing my screen. OK. Any questions about anything we did today?\n00:45:37 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:45:38 Speaker 1\nNo. OK, how about you?\n00:45:40 Speaker 3\nMom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n00:45:51 Speaker 4\nHmm.\n00:45:53 Speaker 3\nI'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n00:45:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n00:46:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:46:49 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:49 Speaker 3\nYou know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n00:46:55 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:47:01 Speaker 3\nDo you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n00:47:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n00:47:40 Speaker 3\nSo I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:47:58 Speaker 4\nYou.\n00:47:59 Speaker 4\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n00:48:01 Speaker 1\nYeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n00:48:01 Speaker 3\nAnd it was.\n00:48:20 Speaker 1\nBecause once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n00:48:33 Speaker 3\nRight. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n00:48:55 Speaker 1\nYes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n00:50:15 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:50:16 Speaker 1\nError. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n00:50:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n00:50:32 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:50:33 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:50:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n00:50:44 Speaker 3\nOhh no, I think we're good, thank.\n00:50:45 Speaker 1\nYou OK? Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and I. Hey. Will get back to you, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:50:57 Speaker 4\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will be oh. I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slide a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So expect another homework for this week, self-care inform. Just just to double check that you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two, you got all the slides. I know, Speaker 6, you got it, Speaker 2, you got it. OK, Speaker 10, you got it too. Yeah. I need to do mine.\n00:51:40 Speaker 10\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n00:51:49 Speaker 4\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Speaker 9, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our part point training. So after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be anytime. But if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd, the so think week six. If you go by numbers in. Your head.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:52:42 Speaker 4\nWeek 6 we would like to hear from you. Just we were asking some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well, you can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share. Together, because chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel, feel free to bring them as well. And I'll send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n00:53:31 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:53:33 Speaker 4\nAny questions?\n00:53:34 Speaker 5\nSorry. Speaker 6, we we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 6, if you still want to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and. Then we'll let. You go, I promise. Sounds good. OK. OK.\n00:53:47 Speaker 4\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can debrief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday.\n00:54:04 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:54:07 Speaker 4\nAll right, Speaker 6, I'm going to open the breakout room. OK. Uh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 6 and Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 can go. And don't forget to record. OK.\n00:54:21 Speaker 2\nYou want me to join or not?\n00:54:23 Speaker 4\nYes, Speaker 6, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going. To change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Gina.\n00:54:44 Speaker 4\nYay, great job.\n00:54:47 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:54:48 Speaker 5\nDid you see?\n00:54:48 Speaker 4\nThe stop recording or who is recording now just telling. Oh yeah, there it is. OK. Oh my goodness. You did. It's amazing job. Gina, I just love how you provided so many solutions on the spot. I was like, this is how a well versed trainer who knows her system can do because there were some of those. I'm like, well, you know. What I don't know, he can do. Like like I can do it. So I was literally like, I'm learning from Tina because I haven't explored. Those. List function. It's super helpful.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities. The patient\u2019s caregiver reports that M.A. has been using the device to play music and videos, set reminders for medications, and manage self-care tasks such as brushing teeth and trimming nails. The patient expresses a desire to improve independence in managing these tasks.\n\n**Goals for Self-Care:**\n- Use technology to remember daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals on time).\n- Set reminders for medication intake (currently taking medications twice daily).\n- Explore additional functionalities of the Alexa device to assist with self-care and medical needs.\n\n**Current Medications:**\n- Depakote (dosage and frequency not specified, but taken twice daily).\n\n**Social History:**\n- M.A. is supported by a caregiver who assists with technology and daily tasks.\n- The patient has access to an iPhone and an iPad, which are used to set reminders and manage tasks.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**\n- No acute symptoms reported; focus is on technology use for self-care management.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Physical Exam Findings:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Technology Assessment:**\n- M.A. successfully used the Alexa device to play music and videos.\n- Caregiver reports that M.A. has set reminders for medications on the iPhone.\n- Discussion about integrating additional functionalities of the Alexa device for reminders related to self-care tasks.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem 1: Difficulty in managing self-care tasks independently.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Lack of familiarity with technology.\n     - Need for structured reminders for daily tasks.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. is currently reliant on caregivers for reminders and assistance with self-care tasks. The use of technology is a positive step towards independence, but further integration and training are needed.\n\n2. **Problem 2: Medication management.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:**\n     - Potential for missed doses if reminders are not effectively set.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. takes medications twice daily and has set reminders on the iPhone. There is a need to ensure that the Alexa device can also assist with medication reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **For Self-Care Management:**\n   - Explore the possibility of setting up a checklist on the Alexa device for daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals).\n   - Research the integration of the Bard app for audiobooks and other reading materials to be accessible via the Alexa device.\n   - Consider implementing tactile markers (bump dots) on the Alexa device to assist M.A. in independently using the mute/unmute functions.\n\n2. **For Medication Management:**\n   - Confirm that reminders for medication intake can be set on the Alexa device.\n   - Educate M.A. on how to use the Alexa device to check off medications taken and set reminders for refills.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess the effectiveness of the implemented strategies and make adjustments as necessary.\n   - Encourage the caregiver to continue supporting M.A. in using the technology and to provide feedback on its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - Provide M.A. and the caregiver with resources on how to maximize the use of the Alexa device for self-care and medication management.\n\n---\n\n**Signature:**\n[Clinician's Name]  \n[Clinician's Title]  \n[Date]   </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for more accurate responses, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Emphasize Session Dynamics:**\n   - The system prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to capture the dynamics of the session, particularly the interactions between M.A. and his caregiver. This can be achieved by including a directive to note instances where the caregiver provides assistance or additional context, ensuring these interactions are reflected in the SOAP note.\n\n2. **Highlight Specific Commands and Success Rates:**\n   - The prompt should guide the LLM to focus on the specific commands practiced during the session and their success rates. Including a directive to document examples of commands, the context in which they were practiced, and any assistance required would help the LLM generate a more detailed and comprehensive Objective section.\n\n3. **Clarify the Relevance of Chief Complaint and HPI:**\n   - The prompt should clarify when to include or exclude elements like the Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness. It could specify that these sections should only be included if they directly relate to the session's focus on technology use and caregiver involvement, preventing unnecessary information from being added.\n\n4. **Focus on Progress and Challenges:**\n   - The system prompt should instruct the LLM to emphasize M.A.'s progress and challenges with the Alexa device in the Assessment section. It should guide the LLM to avoid formal differential diagnoses unless relevant, and instead provide a narrative that highlights specific challenges, such as command recognition issues.\n\n5. **Detail Home Practice Tasks:**\n   - The prompt should encourage the LLM to include specific home practice tasks in the Plan section. It could direct the LLM to list commands and tasks for M.A. to practice at home, providing clear guidance for both M.A. and his caregiver.\n\n6. **Enhance Contextual Relevance:**\n   - The system prompt should ensure that the LLM reflects the session's context, including discussions about integrating additional functionalities of the Alexa device. It could include a directive to capture any plans or discussions about future technology use for self-care and medication management.\n\n7. **Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms:**\n   - The prompt could include a mechanism for the LLM to self-assess its output against the target note's focus, ensuring alignment with the session's objectives. This could involve a checklist or set of questions the LLM uses to verify the inclusion of key elements.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into the system prompt, the LLM can be better guided to produce a SOAP note that aligns with the session's focus and the target note's structure, ultimately improving the quality and relevance of the generated response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-15-2024 (Week 5) M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Clinician\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient R.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Clinician\nSpeaker 11: Clinician\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 12: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver\nSpeaker 13: Clinician\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:02 Speaker 1\nPerfect. I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for more accurate responses, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Emphasize Contextual Understanding**: The system prompt should encourage the LLM to focus on understanding the context of the conversation, particularly the specific user scenarios and commands practiced by M.A. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to pay attention to the details of the interactions, motivations, and roles of the participants, such as M.A.'s cooperation and the encouragement from his mother and clinicians.\n\n2. **Highlight Specificity in Documentation**: The prompt should stress the importance of including specific details from the conversation in the SOAP note. This includes the exact commands practiced, the challenges faced, and the strategies discussed to overcome these challenges. By doing so, the LLM can generate a more comprehensive and aligned note.\n\n3. **Encourage Detailed Analysis**: The system prompt should guide the LLM to perform a deeper analysis of the challenges M.A. faced with the Alexa device. This includes understanding the issues with verbal output, the need for prompts to speak louder, and the specific user needs assessment. Encouraging a detailed analysis will enhance the accuracy of the \"Assessment\" section.\n\n4. **Focus on Actionable Plans**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to create a \"Plan\" section that includes specific tasks and commands for M.A. to practice, as outlined in the target note's home exercise program. This will provide a clear and actionable plan for M.A. to improve his interaction with the device.\n\n5. **Balance Between Structure and Flexibility**: While the SOAP note structure is important, the prompt should also allow for flexibility in rearranging the order if it benefits the clarity and relevance of the information. For instance, considering the APSO order if it provides a more logical flow of information.\n\n6. **Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms**: The prompt should include a mechanism for the LLM to incorporate feedback from previous iterations, allowing it to refine its responses based on what has been effective or ineffective in past outputs.\n\n7. **Enhance Tone and Detail**: The prompt should guide the LLM to match the tone and level of detail of the target note. This includes providing a thorough account of M.A.'s interactions, challenges, and the context of the training, ensuring the generated note is as detailed and specific as the target note.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt can better guide the LLM to produce a SOAP note that aligns more closely with the target note, thereby improving the overall quality and accuracy of the generated response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs.

An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion.

And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M. is a [age] year-old [gender] who is learning to use their Alexa device for reminders and entertainment. \n- The patient expressed satisfaction with their ability to set reminders independently, stating, \"I'm pretty happy.\"\n- Patient enjoys watching sports, particularly ice hockey, and playing video games.

Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:29 Speaker 2\nAll right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:34 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:04:36 Speaker 3\nAlright.

OK. All right.\n00:05:03 Speaker 4\nMe.\n00:05:07 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To currently use for for these uh, entertainment activities. So definitely there's TV.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:05:28 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:34 Speaker 3\nUh-huh.\n00:05:36 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What? Else, do you use do you use? Your phones or computer?\n00:05:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, I do.\n00:05:45 Speaker 2\nPhone.

So now we're gonna come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know, the things that you can say to Speaker 4 so that it could play it for you. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what? Would the first one be here?\n00:06:55 Speaker 1\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 3 on TV. How would you go about doing that?\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nClick the channel.\n00:07:05 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:05 Speaker 3\nWatch it. Hey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel? Is Isaac.\n00:07:20 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:21 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that correct?\n00:07:22 Speaker 1\nShe just.\n00:07:24 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:28 Speaker 4\nBecause it's more related to that.\n00:07:31 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nAnd.\n00:07:37 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:07:49 Speaker 4\nSomething say it again.\n00:07:52 Speaker 2\nEyes help you with law.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nShould I you, Sir?\n00:07:54 Speaker 2\nYeah. Yeah, I would.\n00:08:00 Speaker 1\nMuted.\n00:08:01 Speaker 2\nOn, alright, what else? What? What other scenario can you think of Speaker 3? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? You broke. Would you wanna listen? To like highlights of a game from, like from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK. OK or what? Kind of music, would you? Would you say you want to?\n00:08:36 Speaker 3\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:08:40 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright. I listen to. Music. From particular.\n00:08:56 Speaker 3\nArtists.\n00:08:57 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. What else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:09:17 Speaker 2\nOK, alright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:26 Speaker 3\nLove yourself.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nAuditory. Stimuli and feedback. Oh.\n00:09:33 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:09:35 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYou used to. A lot of.\n00:09:42 Speaker 2\nAny particular kind of like maybe you know how some of those games have? Like, they're related to words or some are, you know, it's like jeopardy or some are. Testing games, things like that. Like is there. Is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:09:59 Speaker 3\nOh.\n00:10:01 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. All right. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:13 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:10:15 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:15 Speaker 1\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, I did. Yeah.\n00:10:25 Speaker 1\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say, like uh, you know, high hey like like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play it.\n00:10:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Is that something Speaker 3, did you used to watch Netflix a lot?\n00:10:53 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. What?\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nSo I can put out my account on there for him, is that correct?\n00:11:01 Speaker 2\nYeah you can. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think? Of or. That's about it.\n00:11:14 Speaker 3\nThat's about it.\n00:11:16 Speaker 2\nHi, alright. Speaker 3, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nThanks.\n00:11:28 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK.\n00:11:30 Speaker 2\nAlright, so we're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands as a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:11:55 Speaker 1\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you are you thinking of like? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely different?\n00:12:27 Speaker 2\nSo Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills, which are games. And which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that with your voice. So definitely that and then.\n00:12:47 Speaker 1\nWhere might I find a? List of. Of those types of games.\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nSo if you would like just go, if you go on Amazon app like the UM, Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games and it it it has, like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like they have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal. OK. Things like that, which are very, very familiar. Of course that those are part of the TV. So but there are different other things as well, so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:31 Speaker 1\nAnd then I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated. OK.\n00:13:35 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:13:38 Speaker 1\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:13:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something, UM, interest that, that would entrust him, I will send it to you.\n00:14:01 Speaker 1\nAs well, uh, that would be.\n00:14:02 Speaker 2\nAwesome. We'll share with him.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that. Or in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision, like luminosity or cognitive, like the names are. I'm kind of escaping them but.\n00:14:16 Speaker 6\nBecause.\n00:14:23 Speaker 1\nThe the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad. IPad so. It just it isn't accessible so.\n00:14:45 Speaker 2\nIt does, yeah, yeah. No, but definitely there are I guess, which require even though there is visualized visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know? So. So yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that, you know. He he cannot play, so that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions, you know, so that it it. Kind of stay sharp, right? Like, that's that's something we all need to do. But definitely that will. That'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time. Speaker 3, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:28 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 3, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it.\n00:15:35 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:15:35 Speaker 1\nRight. I don't think she heard you.\n00:15:44 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:15:49 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:15:55 Speaker 3\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:15:58 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:00 Speaker 3\n9:30.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 9:37.\n00:16:06 Speaker 3\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:08 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go? For to go to a beach. Ohh, that's amazing. OK alright.\n00:16:15 Speaker 1\nI said, where are we going tomorrow? It's to give me an idea for what? To set it for.\n00:16:21 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM it will it will set it to the closest like so since it's evening already it's going to set it. To. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know? Yeah, it will just set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:16:49 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:16:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right.\n00:16:54 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:16:57 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room. Hey, all right. Hey, Speaker 3. OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. All right, Speaker 3. So this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next or would you? To do a joke.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:43 Speaker 3\nA joke.\n00:17:44 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some. Use it. Some music all right. All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me like a Star Trek joke. Speaker 4, tell me a Doctor Who joke. Anything that you like can can can be a joke like that so. Sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:18:39 Speaker 3\nTry a joke.\n00:18:41 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:18:47 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:18:51 Speaker 4\nHere's a despicable new joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:05 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:07 Speaker 4\nGuidance.\n00:19:16 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 3. OK.\n00:19:17 Speaker 5\n1st.\n00:19:19 Speaker 3\nYou're the most.\n00:19:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:19:56 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:01 Speaker 1\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:04 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 3, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom which sort of means that. It heard your voice or it. It's the wake up word for it. So uh, it. It almost means that it the UM the device is. Listening so. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get it goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are a lot of questions even online when you just like. Kind of search that what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. So.\n00:21:21 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n00:21:24 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 3.\n00:21:33 Speaker 1\nMake a clean one.\n00:21:35 Speaker 3\nNipsey hussle.\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nIt's not that clean. It's not. You can do anything, Speaker 3. Whatever you want. Just.\n00:21:50 Speaker 3\nCan I get a clean song?\n00:21:54 Speaker 1\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:21:55 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can I get cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:00 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with a cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:08 Speaker 1\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:10 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:21 Speaker 1\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey song.\n00:22:22 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh yeah.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nAnd lexicon song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. An app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something. Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like yeah, even.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nOK. What's a common song living on a prayer?\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nLiving on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:11 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:15 Speaker 2\nOh, hey. So Speaker 3, I guess.\n00:23:20 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month contained canceled. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. OK. Should I sign you up and play?\n00:23:27 Speaker 4\nLiving on a prayer.\n00:23:27 Speaker 1\nTo say not right now.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 3, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:23:51 Speaker 3\nSweet Caroline.\n00:23:54 Speaker 1\nTell.\n00:23:55 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:23:59 Speaker 1\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:02 Speaker 4\nNurses station, based on student Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:07 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:10 Speaker 1\nThere you go.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nYeah, alright. Is it playing?\n00:24:17 Speaker 1\nIt is.\n00:24:18 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. Alright. Do you want to? Do the volume up or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:33 Speaker 3\nThat we have.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:24:40 Speaker 3\nYeah, like I said, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:24:47 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward the stream.\n00:24:50 Speaker 1\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:24:54 Speaker 4\nReally. Yeah.\n00:24:56 Speaker 2\nThat's so odd.\n00:24:58 Speaker 3\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:00 Speaker 1\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know.\n00:25:05 Speaker 2\nHuh.\n00:25:09 Speaker 1\nWhy don't you say volume? Speaker 3.\n00:25:12 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt did the opposite, yeah. Give it how many times I believe.\n00:25:28 Speaker 3\nVolume up by 3.\n00:25:31 Speaker 4\nAnd no sound. If I.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 3. Down two times.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 4, volume down to times.\n00:25:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, it did. There you go.\n00:25:54 Speaker 2\nPerfect. How about we try? The two play it from the beginning.\n00:26:05 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:14 Speaker 1\nTry again.\n00:26:15 Speaker 3\nHey, Alex, can you play this song from the beginning? So. Hey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:29 Speaker 4\nHe's starting his song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:26:35 Speaker 2\nThere was a lot of restrictions here I. Guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and. Go back, play from the beginning. All of that also, we're definitely able to do all of that so. Yeah.\n00:27:05 Speaker 1\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 3 has Apple music. I wonder. Yeah. That when I should be able to hook the Apple music. To.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nIt yeah, you should be able to. OK. Definitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. OK. Alright. And maybe if you had like a. Made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well. You know. So our previous songs go back.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 3 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:08 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line, one step blue line is on and then you start speaking it definitely picks up the command better. Right. I think if it's in if if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it it doesn't usually it. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 3 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just wanna say, like, maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works. Yeah. Where there's, like, a just a very small pause. It doesn't even have to be very long because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you, you're not going to say anything. Next. So. Yeah, but more or less, you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying, uh, playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you. Yeah, but OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Alright, so even even though Speaker 3 you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But. It just has to be just Speaker 4. Uh. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Uh. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has, yeah.\n00:30:45 Speaker 1\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 3 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will. Well, and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give a visual description of what's going on in the background of the movie. So it'll describe the scenes and some TV's do that, ours doesn't. But some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature. So I dream if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's I it's something description, audio description or something like that.\n00:31:20 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:31:35 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nJust.\n00:31:48 Speaker 2\nSo.\n00:31:48 Speaker 1\nDo you understand? I'm trying. I'm. I'm.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Yeah, it's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the sure that's going on on the screen, so. Thanks.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nFor what you have on the screen right now, it would say something like blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background. And. With the following word.\n00:32:18 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. Uh, if if it has the kind of. Captioning or yeah.\n00:32:33 Speaker 5\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:32:35 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about.\n00:32:39 Speaker 5\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 3, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example if you. Decide to like look up pictures. From like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own closed captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us in that respect.\n00:33:32 Speaker 1\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nStarting to. OK. OK. Right. Right. Yeah, like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh, But yeah, I mean, maybe if they're not providing yet, but hopefully in the future, very soon, even Alex, I should start providing that. Hopefully that that will help a lot. Yeah.\n00:34:23 Speaker 1\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:26 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:29 Speaker 3\nM.\n00:34:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. All right. So I guess that's about it. Let me stop sharing. Alright. Is there anything else, Speaker 3 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or? Anything related? To today's. Question.\n00:34:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:34:59 Speaker 2\nOr in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nI don't think yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 3's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch it back to our house. So it worked out because Speaker 3 was living in Kansas. Prior to, you know.\n00:35:25 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, sure. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help you. With any of those.\n00:35:45 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:35:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 3, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:01 Speaker 1\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 3. There you go.\n00:36:03 Speaker 2\nAlright, perfect. There you go. All right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main main main room or?\n00:36:21 Speaker 1\nLet.\n00:36:21 Speaker 2\nWhat should we do?\n00:36:21 Speaker 1\nMe.\n00:36:25 Speaker 5\nIt looks.\n00:36:25 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave and go to the main room.\n00:36:28 Speaker 5\nI don't know. Yeah, we I guess we could go cause I or. I don't know if people left or. People went back.\n00:36:37 Speaker 2\nI have no clue.\n00:36:43 Speaker 5\nGenex group is back. In the news.\n00:36:45 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the meeting room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah. Yeah. No, thank.\n00:36:54 Speaker 1\nAll right.\n00:36:55 Speaker 5\nYou so much for the recommendation.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nThank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:01 Speaker 1\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, leave the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- 00:37:20 Speaker 7\nHey. Speaker 3, we have friends who are still working on their things. Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more, cause Speaker 4 is too. Quick for him. So we did have that. Speaker 6, you're very up to speed with your old Speaker 8 and Speaker 3. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So if you're done, we just want to say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Speaker 6.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nBye.\n00:37:58 Speaker 7\nOhh bye. Ohh Speaker 6. I did want to say we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type.\n00:38:25 Speaker 6\nType in. See.\n00:38:29 Speaker 7\nOK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 1, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 3 and Speaker 1, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:25 Speaker 6\nWhere are you sending the link for me?\n00:39:28\nOK.\n00:39:30 Speaker 7\nSo.\n00:39:30 Speaker 6\nMuticus.\n00:39:33 Speaker 7\nIt's in the chat, Speaker 6, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:39:45 Speaker 6\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:39:51 Speaker 7\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on. Your. IPad but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:18 Speaker 6\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:22 Speaker 7\nOK, four. E-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:33 Speaker 1\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Claire sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it the QUADRA survey. That one. So we send that we fill that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to. Send later on in the week.\n00:40:55 Speaker 7\nYeah, for the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders, so. OK, just share some feedback on what you explored and Claire had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:08 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:41:09 Speaker 7\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one. For this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us, so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n00:41:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Bye. Thank you.\n00:41:48 Speaker 3\nSee you later on.\n00:42:05 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 6 has Tina.\n00:42:11 Speaker 4\nAgnes.\n00:42:33 Speaker 7\nRosie, did you get the homework link I emailed you?\n00:42:35 Speaker 5\nYeah, I I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:42:38 Speaker 7\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday. Bye.\n00:42:41 Speaker 6\nRight.\n00:42:45 Speaker 5\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I was. Cracking up the entire time.\n00:42:52 Speaker 7\nHey, I don't know how you run it with the poker face.\n00:42:58 Speaker 5\nOh my God.\n00:42:59 Speaker 7\nStop the video. Ohh boy. Ohh. Who has it all? Well, you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:09 Speaker 5\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:11 Speaker 7\nSo funny. OK, who had this? That was not me. I think it's you.\n00:43:14 Speaker 2\nEqual. OK here I stopped it. Stop it. Wait, why is it? Stop being recording. OK? I don't know.\n00:43:25 Speaker 7\nIt's recording, I don't know.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.A.  \n**Date:** 07-25-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Setting:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M.A. is participating in a session to assess the use of technology for reminders and entertainment.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old male with visual impairment.

For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-01-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Breakout room training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Clinician\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient F.W.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Patient L.V.G.\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nRecording. So we're gonna go over some questions related to self-care and medical needs today. So first of all, though, we're going to do a little review of the last week's comments. So you're going to show me how you can play music, play music, or a video of your choice with your Speaker 4 device. So you want to go ahead and do that? Speaker 2, do you want to give it a command?\n00:00:37 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you play? A video from. January 3rd. OK.\n00:00:56 Speaker 1\nDoes it? Is it playing anything?\n00:00:58 Speaker 3\nYes it is.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:01:00 Speaker 3\nI hooked up Speaker 2's apple music. To the elect. Don't ask me how I did it, but. I figured it out. OK. We did hook it up and he's been able. He's been using that feature a lot, he'll say, play Bon Jovi or and it will just start playing a. Yeah. Bunch of Bon Jovi songs.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK. So when?\n00:01:27 Speaker 3\nBut I do have a question.\n00:01:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, go ahead. Yeah.\n00:01:31 Speaker 3\nThat just turn it off, Speaker 2.\n00:01:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:38 Speaker 3\nLouder.\n00:01:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:01:42 Speaker 3\nIt's muted. That's fine.\n00:01:43 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:48 Speaker 3\nIn in relation to the music, Speaker 2 listens to a radio station in the mornings. It's a KC 790.\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nUh-huh.\n00:01:59 Speaker 3\nSo is there a way to hook that up as well?\n00:02:04 Speaker 1\nThere should be actually.\n00:02:08 Speaker 3\nAnd if not, I believe the show he listens to is on that iheart app. So I don't, I do, we don't have that either, but I those are that was part part one and we could hook it up then it would be the same way. Part 2 is Speaker 2 gets books from. Guard. Which is for from Berlin Institute their books. It's a reading library and you choose your books on Bard and then you can play. Listen to your books. Is it possible to hook that up to Speaker 4 or should it just be YouTube? On YouTube you can actually listen to all kinds of stories as well.\n00:02:51 Speaker 1\nRight, so I'm pretty. Sure that the audible, I I don't know if you know there's a there's a website called Audible which has audible books. I'm pretty sure that can be hooked up to Speaker 4. I am not very sure about about the board. OK. But I can check and let you know about that one. Yeah, I I can research a little bit and maybe maybe get back to you is it called Bard Bard.\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOhh OK. Correct. OK. It's rail institute.\n00:03:25 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK, alright, let me check I I almost wonder if if it could be. Synced into your phone. And because your phones Speaker 4 is synced in with the Speaker 4 on the Echo. So if it could be played on the phone, it could be played on here, but I will check and let.\n00:03:44 Speaker 4\nUh-huh.\n00:03:51 Speaker 1\nYou know for sure.\n00:03:52 Speaker 3\nOK. And just so you know, I put the Bard app is on his iPad and I put the Speaker 4 app on the iPad.\n00:03:58 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nAnd they're both and. The pad is linked to the.\n00:04:02 Speaker 1\nPhone, phone. Perfect. So, alright. OK. I can. I can look that up for sure. One was the Bard and then other one was the.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nOh.\n00:04:11 Speaker 1\nMusic. You said. No. What? What was that?\n00:04:13 Speaker 3\nAt the radio station, it's OK.\n00:04:15 Speaker 1\nRadio station about yes.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nAt K ABC 790 OK Yeah 790.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nABC.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAll right. So all right, those are very specific questions, so.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nI didn't. Well, we're we're trying.\n00:04:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, no, that's perfect. But so Speaker 2, I had a question. So when you said Speaker 4 play a video from January 3rd, what did it bring up? Did it, was it anything specific that what what did was that the command that he that you gave?\n00:04:48 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what command did you give?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nJust command.\n00:04:53 Speaker 3\nCan you repeat it? Yeah. What was it?\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nYou like to play. New memory from January 3rd.\n00:05:03 Speaker 3\nA memory from January.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\n3rd memory OK, play a memory from OK. So did it. What did it bring up? I'm just curious.\n00:05:14 Speaker 3\nIt did. It was a video and then the music started playing.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nFor you.\n00:05:20 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK. All right, but. Very nice, Speaker 2. I mean, I'm, I'm so impressed. All right, so.\n00:05:31 Speaker 4\nThat for you.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:05:34 Speaker 1\nAll right, perfect. All right, Speaker 2. So let's move over to this week's topic. What type? So I have a few questions I want to ask you. First, initially to 1st ASK is is like what is your goal when it comes to self-care and medical needs? Using Speaker 4, what would you say your goal is?\n00:06:02 Speaker 3\nFor health and medical needs, Speaker 2 to use Speaker 4.\n00:06:04 Speaker 2\nHow's the mass on each? Here. Brushing my teeth.\n00:06:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright. What did you what? What else did you say?\n00:06:23 Speaker 3\nTrimming his nails.\n00:06:25 Speaker 1\nOK, trimming the nails. Perfect. Alright. Anything else you can think of?\n00:06:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, eating breakfast.\n00:06:36 Speaker 1\nCorrect. So eating meals on time?\n00:06:39 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:06:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n00:07:07 Speaker 3\nAre you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:07:16 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n00:07:40 Speaker 2\nMy iPhone.\n00:07:42 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n00:07:56 Speaker 3\nAre you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n00:08:00 Speaker 2\nMaking reminders on the iPhone.\n00:08:04 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nSo OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n00:08:50 Speaker 3\nIf I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n00:09:06 Speaker 1\nGot it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n00:10:11 Speaker 2\nSo I can. Make goals.\n00:10:17 Speaker 3\nMake goals.\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:21 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n00:11:00 Speaker 3\nWould you like her to remind you?\n00:11:04 Speaker 3\nTo eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n00:11:12 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:11:15 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nBrushing my teeth.\n00:11:37 Speaker 3\nBrushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n00:11:40 Speaker 1\nAll right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n00:12:13 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n00:12:27 Speaker 1\nYours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nThe same right? And that makes like more.\n00:12:49 Speaker 1\nYou think of that, Speaker 2?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nThat's a good idea.\n00:12:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n00:13:59 Speaker 3\nFair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n00:14:13 Speaker 4\nMHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nThat'd be good. OK.\n00:14:21 Speaker 3\nBecause I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n00:14:31 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:14:31 Speaker 3\nWould be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n00:14:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n00:14:54 Speaker 3\nOK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n00:15:09 Speaker 1\nUh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n00:15:12 Speaker 3\nA barred book is what I'm thinking.\n00:15:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n00:15:25 Speaker 3\nOh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n00:15:42 Speaker 1\nYou know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n00:16:19 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n00:16:21 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n00:16:40 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:16:42 Speaker 1\nI almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n00:16:46 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:16:47 Speaker 1\nThe device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n00:16:50 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:17:08 Speaker 1\nBecause there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n00:17:19 Speaker 3\nWell, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n00:17:26 Speaker 1\nThat's all.\n00:17:31 Speaker 3\nFeel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n00:17:35 Speaker 1\nThat would be great.\n00:17:35 Speaker 3\nCould behind.\n00:17:38 Speaker 1\nThat would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n00:17:44 Speaker 3\nOK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n00:17:52 Speaker 1\nOhh OK Speaker 2.\n00:17:57 Speaker 3\nThey were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n00:18:05 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:18:08 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:18:08 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:18:11 Speaker 3\nThere. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n00:18:15 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:18:16 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n00:18:41 Speaker 1\nYeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n00:18:49 Speaker 3\nBut an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n00:18:53 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:18:55 Speaker 3\nDo I just say to open the bar app?\n00:18:59 Speaker 1\nYeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n00:19:03 Speaker 3\nOK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n00:19:25 Speaker 1\nNo, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n00:19:57 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nSearching for the.\n00:20:04 Speaker 3\nBard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n00:20:12 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:20:14 Speaker 4\nCouncil.\n00:20:15 Speaker 1\nIs there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n00:21:05 Speaker 4\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n00:21:08 Speaker 3\nOK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n00:21:18 Speaker 4\nSearching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n00:21:19 Speaker 3\nIt's not understanding the bars.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nThat's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n00:21:26 Speaker 3\nMaybe yeah.\n00:21:29 Speaker 1\nAnother another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n00:21:59 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:02 Speaker 1\nTo.\n00:22:04 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n00:22:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n00:22:25 Speaker 3\nNope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nIs Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n00:22:46 Speaker 3\nNo, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nIt's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n00:22:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nIt's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n00:23:15 Speaker 3\nI'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n00:23:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n00:23:48 Speaker 4\nMy.\n00:23:52 Speaker 1\nAlright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n00:24:20 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:24:21 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n00:24:46 Speaker 3\nThe breakout room.\n00:24:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:24:48 Speaker 3\nOK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n00:24:51 Speaker 1\nAbsolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- \nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 2.\n00:25:10 Speaker 2\nHey, what's up?\n00:25:12 Speaker 1\nAlright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n00:25:50 Speaker 3\nUnmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n00:26:07 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:26:11 Speaker 3\nOK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n00:26:12 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Could.\n00:26:21 Speaker 1\nOK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:28 Speaker 2\nOK. Thank you.\n00:26:30 Speaker 3\nGo ahead.\n00:26:31 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:44 Speaker 4\nI've checked off oranges from medication.\n00:26:47 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:26:49 Speaker 1\nOhh did it say check off?\n00:26:49 Speaker 3\nAnd. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n00:26:55 Speaker 1\nNo longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n00:27:25 Speaker 2\nIbuprofen.\n00:27:27 Speaker 1\nOK, well you have been.\n00:27:28 Speaker 3\nWhat's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n00:27:38 Speaker 2\nTypical.\n00:27:39 Speaker 3\nOK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n00:27:42 Speaker 2\nEvery day.\n00:27:43 Speaker 3\nAt what time? In the morning it's at.\n00:27:53 Speaker 2\n7:30.\n00:27:55 Speaker 3\nOK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n00:28:00 Speaker 1\nOK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n00:28:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n00:28:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n00:28:22 Speaker 3\n10.\n00:28:23 Speaker 1\n7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to take Depakote at 7:30 AM tomorrow.\n00:28:42 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:47 Speaker 1\nOK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n00:29:09 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:29:10 Speaker 1\nOK, let's do that command.\n00:29:15 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n00:29:31 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n00:29:36 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n00:30:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:30:29 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away on Canyon Way, right? A 1.4 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite 110, Walgreens 2.3 miles away on Haven Ave. you can ask me for things like what's the phone number for the first one?\n00:30:51 Speaker 1\nOK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n00:31:04 Speaker 3\nIf that makes sense.\n00:31:07 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n00:31:49 Speaker 3\nJust so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nRight, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n00:32:08 Speaker 3\nJust so you. You had a heads up and. So you you know what?\n00:32:13 Speaker 1\nI mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n00:32:45 Speaker 3\nHe didn't.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I do my laundry?\n00:32:59 Speaker 1\nDid it pick it up?\n00:33:01 Speaker 3\nIt it's showing it's. A video and pictures and a lot of words on how to do it. Let me just make sure the volumes up, yeah, the volumes 3/4.\n00:33:14 Speaker 1\nOh, OK.\n00:33:16 Speaker 3\nIt picked it up but it. I don't know if my cord. Will reach the camera.\n00:33:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Is it is it more visual? Maybe like rather than ohh it's like a very text. It's all.\n00:33:30 Speaker 3\nIt's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n00:33:36 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n00:33:59 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Give me the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:12 Speaker 3\nIt's doing the same thing, the same thing. Try tell me how to do laundry that way you're telling her to? Read it to. You.\n00:34:21 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:34:22 Speaker 3\nSorry again, Speaker 2.\n00:34:25 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Hey, Speaker 4. Tell me how to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:40 Speaker 3\nIt's written again. It's written again. OK, OK, directions. Speaker 2.\n00:34:50 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me the directions to do my laundry.\n00:34:58 Speaker 4\nAt the moment, traffic to vineyards marketplace cleaners at 11460 Canyon Way looks pretty clear.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nOhh it's giving like.\n00:35:05 Speaker 4\nJust about 3 minutes via Canyon with her place.\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's a.\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nYeah. It's like a laundromat. Probably gets. Right. OK, alright. Alright, let's try another one. OK, let's try this set reminder to do laundry. Maybe that's a function more functional one. I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n00:35:54 Speaker 2\nM. OK.\n00:35:57 Speaker 3\nGo.\n00:35:58 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to. Do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:05 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:36:07 Speaker 2\nTo do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:11 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:36:12 Speaker 2\nTomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:20 Speaker 4\nIs that 5:00? In the morning or in the afternoon.\n00:36:22 Speaker 2\nIn the afternoon.\n00:36:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.\n00:36:32 Speaker 1\nBye. Purpose. OK, good job. Does these kind of reminders help Speaker 2? Maybe. That would be more functional in the real life, you think.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 1\nAlright, yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. When I asked Speaker 2, I was cooking and I asked him to set the timer for me and that was very optional. Yes.\n00:36:57 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, that is great.\n00:37:01 Speaker 3\nAnd she even told. Speaker 4, to set my mom at the time.\n00:37:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. So. OK. OK. All right, so getting stains out of clothes. What else?\n00:37:19 Speaker 3\nOK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n00:37:21 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n00:37:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:37:44 Speaker 3\nWhat?\n00:37:44 Speaker 2\nWhat do I use to get a stain out of my clothes?\n00:37:52 Speaker 4\nTo remove stains from clothes, rinse the stain with cold water and scrub it with the brush and soap. If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in cold water and soak for an hour. Then wash the clothing as usual.\n00:38:06 Speaker 3\nThis one showed the words in paragraph as well as Reddit.\n00:38:11 Speaker 1\nThat's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n00:38:18 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:38:37 Speaker 1\nText. But. I almost wonder for the laundry part. If we'd ask her to give me the first step to do my laundry or something like that.\n00:38:51 Speaker 3\nYeah. Try that, Speaker 2.\n00:38:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you give me the first step to do my laundry?\n00:39:06 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:39:08 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n00:39:41 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:39:41 Speaker 3\nI think that was the paragraph that she didn't read before.\n00:39:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, but it read. It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n00:40:20 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:40:24 Speaker 1\nDo you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n00:40:48 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. When do I use the fabric softener?\n00:40:57 Speaker 4\nAccording to an Speaker 4 Answers contributor. Add fabric softener to the wash during the rinse cycle.\n00:41:05 Speaker 1\nOK. All right.\n00:41:08 Speaker 3\nMakes sense?\n00:41:09 Speaker 1\nOK, I think this is pretty functional here. So Speaker 2 say that you have a headache and you need some answers on how to treat it on your own. So you're going to say the wake word and say, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:32 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:42 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for a migraine include applying ice packs to the back of the neck, forehead or temples, taking a nap, taking a warm shower or bath, massage, drinking water resting in a low lit room, or physical therapy.\n00:42:00 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. OK. All right, let's do the same for stomach pains. OK, so say you have a sudden stomach pain and you want to know what remedies you can use. So you're going to say the wake word. And what do I take for stomach pains? Ready. Cool.\n00:42:27 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:35 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:42:38 Speaker 4\nHuh.\n00:42:40 Speaker 1\nInteresting. Let me try that one more time, OK. On mine, Speaker 4, mute. What do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:55 Speaker 4\nI don't know that one.\n00:42:58 Speaker 1\nIt says the same thing for me too.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nOh wow.\n00:43:02 Speaker 1\nYeah. So we'll have to try that one one more time.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n00:43:14 Speaker 1\nOK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n00:43:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:43:27 Speaker 1\nUh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:09 Speaker 3\nWhat kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:20 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. All Star physical therapy 3.1 miles away on Rochester Ave. Suite 110, team Physical therapy, 3 miles away on Town Center. Dr. Rancho San Antonio Rehab Center, 2.3 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite G30.\n00:44:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n00:45:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's.\n00:45:21 Speaker 2\nYeah it does.\n00:45:24 Speaker 1\nOK, I think we are through with the slides. Let me stop sharing my screen. OK. Any questions about anything we did today?\n00:45:37 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:45:38 Speaker 1\nNo. OK, how about you?\n00:45:40 Speaker 3\nMom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n00:45:51 Speaker 4\nHmm.\n00:45:53 Speaker 3\nI'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n00:45:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n00:46:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:46:49 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:49 Speaker 3\nYou know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n00:46:55 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:47:01 Speaker 3\nDo you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n00:47:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n00:47:40 Speaker 3\nSo I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:47:58 Speaker 4\nYou.\n00:47:59 Speaker 4\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n00:48:01 Speaker 1\nYeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n00:48:01 Speaker 3\nAnd it was.\n00:48:20 Speaker 1\nBecause once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n00:48:33 Speaker 3\nRight. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n00:48:55 Speaker 1\nYes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n00:50:15 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:50:16 Speaker 1\nError. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n00:50:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n00:50:32 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:50:33 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:50:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n00:50:44 Speaker 3\nOhh no, I think we're good, thank.\n00:50:45 Speaker 1\nYou OK? Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and I. Hey. Will get back to you, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:50:57 Speaker 4\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will be oh. I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slide a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So expect another homework for this week, self-care inform. Just just to double check that you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two, you got all the slides. I know, Speaker 6, you got it, Speaker 2, you got it. OK, Speaker 10, you got it too. Yeah. I need to do mine.\n00:51:40 Speaker 10\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n00:51:49 Speaker 4\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Speaker 9, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our part point training. So after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be anytime. But if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd, the so think week six. If you go by numbers in. Your head.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:52:42 Speaker 4\nWeek 6 we would like to hear from you. Just we were asking some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well, you can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share. Together, because chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel, feel free to bring them as well. And I'll send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n00:53:31 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:53:33 Speaker 4\nAny questions?\n00:53:34 Speaker 5\nSorry. Speaker 6, we we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 6, if you still want to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and. Then we'll let. You go, I promise. Sounds good. OK. OK.\n00:53:47 Speaker 4\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can debrief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday.\n00:54:04 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:54:07 Speaker 4\nAll right, Speaker 6, I'm going to open the breakout room. OK. Uh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 6 and Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 can go. And don't forget to record. OK.\n00:54:21 Speaker 2\nYou want me to join or not?\n00:54:23 Speaker 4\nYes, Speaker 6, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going. To change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Gina.\n00:54:44 Speaker 4\nYay, great job.\n00:54:47 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:54:48 Speaker 5\nDid you see?\n00:54:48 Speaker 4\nThe stop recording or who is recording now just telling. Oh yeah, there it is. OK. Oh my goodness. You did. It's amazing job. Gina, I just love how you provided so many solutions on the spot. I was like, this is how a well versed trainer who knows her system can do because there were some of those. I'm like, well, you know. What I don't know, he can do. Like like I can do it. So I was literally like, I'm learning from Tina because I haven't explored. Those. List function. It's super helpful.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem.

One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion.

Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright.

I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one.

Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes.

Well, um, I actually do two schedules. I have a physical calendar here on my wall. I write it in my hand. I have my phone. I have the, you know, the iphone has the scheduling app. You just put it and like, oh, I'm doing this at this time but you can look at it here sometimes when I'm out in public in the grocery store or was walking down the street. My phone is always with me but I always put it on my, the wall calendar here because I have my therapy. It's scheduled on my wall. I can look at it all the time here at my desk. But, um, if it's on my phone and put it in two places, it makes me think about it. Yeah. \n\nSPEAKER 1: So you had it on your iphone app and is there a particular app you're using?\n\nSPEAKER 2: Um, it's just a scheduling app on the iphone. You just call the Google or Apple, the calendar. It's a, it's a Apple calendar on your, so it's a iphone thing. Usually I type in little event and say, oh, and tonight from 530 to 630 I have a UC speech clinic. So it's, I'll put it in there. \n\nSPEAKER 1: That's great. Thank you so much for sharing. Um, and the wall calendar is just like you have a paper one in, in your, in your home. Right? \n\nSPEAKER 2: Yeah, it's right here on my wall. It's right next to my desk. So if I have it here and also on my phone, it's like double calendar. It's like for me, if I did it twice, I'm gonna do it. I see it. I'm gonna do it. \n\nSPEAKER 1: That's great. Double reinforcement. Um. Ok, great. Uh When do you need to set up alarm, a reminder or a reminder for appointment? \n\nSPEAKER 2: Um, well, if I have go to physical therapy, I may need to take either my mom or dad drives me over there. So I like, set an alarm for about like an hour or 45 minutes before and get dressed and ask him to come take me over to physical therapy. So I could use that like on either on my cell phone or Speaker 4 coming up to like, make me get ready for going to an appointment. \n\nSPEAKER 1: Ok. Makes sense. And then the third question, um, like what type of appointments do you need to schedule and, or keep up with besides like the physical therapy? \n\nSPEAKER 2: Um, well, I, I also do, um, like there's speech therapy, um, sessions I do through another, um, therapy network in Orange County. They are like these virtual sessions. Um, I have, um, twice a week, like Monday and Thursday. I just put alarms on my phone or my, maybe when actually coming up I can just go, I have that in half an hour or something. Mhm. If I hear it or if I have it in my phone, I'll, oh, I need to do that. It's like a little visual reminder. I have really visual or if I hear it, I like um someone like gives me a call, my mom or someone outside my room says we need to go to the store today if I hear it or if I see it, I can remind her. \n\nSPEAKER 1: So, ok, so the type of uh appointments you need to keep up with like uh going to grocery stores and going outside with families. \n\nSPEAKER 2: Um I would probably like, you know, go to physical therapy appointments and going over to um this therapy network in the city of Cyprus called Brain. They have like a social hour network. So every Tuesday night I go over there. So it's uh put it in my calendar. My phone will like put a little reminder during the hour before I need to get ready. So. \n\nSPEAKER 1: Ok, great. Um Can you think about 10 scenarios to complete a sentence \u201cI want to set a reminder and timer slash notification for _____ like just by telling what are the things you need to get ready and set reminders for. Let's just start brainstorming this so we can create it.\n\nSPEAKER 2: Um Maybe I need to set a reminder or um like socializing with my friends and family, we're going to a restaurant. So I need to look good and also like have a good time with my sisters. Need to communicate well, so II need to put on a good outfit and have bring in good topics in my head for conversation. But if I had like my phone or my, my Alex. So do I have that device? You may oh I need to get ready now. \n\nSPEAKER 1: Mhm. Ok. That's the second one. I got socializing with friends and family. \n\nSPEAKER 2: Yeah, it's one of my goals cause like a bunch of my peers like uh on their stuff on streaming stuff all the time. So I'm just like, I'll  talk to you. It's like, so I need to get into a moderate like communication. I said people like, oh they wanna zoom you or facetime you. I'm like, I wanna go to the grocery store. \n\nSPEAKER 1: Yeah, that's lovely. And uh we had another clinician Lauren. She is just joining us. Um Hi Lauren. \n\nSPEAKER 3: Hi, sorry, I'm late. We were just party. [overlapping speech omitted] \n\nSPEAKER 1: OK. OK. We're just getting started on learning about her specific needs. Um And by answering the question, I want to set a timer reminder notification for Rosie mentioned she wanted to socialize with friends and families. Have a good time. With sisters. Uh, think about outfits and topics to talk about. That's super functional. Anything else you can come up with? \n\nSPEAKER 2: Um, well, reminders when II had to go over to my physical therapy clinic, like, maybe like an hour before I get ready and you put your shoes on and water bottle and, like, tell my, one of my parents didn't take me over to the clinic. So it'd be like, like maybe like an hour before I get ready. And sometimes, well, when you're in physical therapy, you need to put your hair up in like a ponytail like this not, you're not like, not supposed to have me down. So I need to like physical care before like um go to one of those sessions or um for me, like a reminder will be like, oh, I need to put my lotion on because my skin is like dry all the time. So I need before pt they so massage me. So I need to put my lotion on because I don't want on their ski. \n\nSPEAKER 1: That's great. Um Anything else you think about reminders and schedules? \n\nSPEAKER 2: Um um maybe I, maybe we'll have to put it in mind. I have like twice a week. I have speech therapy sessions and II do like maybe like half an hour or like, you know, 20 minutes before. So I'll just get ready for speech because like, um, like bringing topics into our, our session of speech and need to like start conversation. Like one of my speech goals is to it's called initiation, like making a move myself. So like I have all these years of just being kind of responding. Mm OK. That needs to be initiation. That's one of my goals. \n\nSPEAKER 1: You sounded amazing. You have a lot of good ideas. We'll definitely work with Angela. She is a close colleague of ours. Um We'll try to bring some ideas for like, topics and everything. Yeah. Ok. Anything else you're on your number five doing very well so far. Think about other reminders, appointments you can customize. \n\nSPEAKER 2: Um, maybe, like, I had someone to go over to my credit union, like, on a couple of times a month to see, like, I have some investments or like, shares in my credit union. I need to be either like, oh, I need to do, I go on weekends and need to go over there and get, um, a new, like, investment or the long term. I rather there too so I can pile them up because my dad says for finances usually the LA, um, like right after each other. So maybe I can remind myself when you go over there, maybe next week or something. \n\nSPEAKER 1: Ok. Financial are quite a union stuff. \n\nYeah. So, like I'm supposed to be, like, in independent is some of my goals to, like, do right? Finances myself and when I move out and have my own house or condo or something I need to be back backing it with my own financial um awareness, not like early on in my recovery, my parents were like running it for me, so I need to think about it myself.\n\nSPEAKER 1: Ok. Um Lauren, are you able to help her with some more additional answers that we can gather here? \n\nSPEAKER 3: Yes, absolutely. \n\nSPEAKER 1: Yeah. Let me let doctor. Ok. Ok, I'm gonna, um, if you can take notes, I'm gonna stop the recording cause I'm gonna be at other rooms. \n\nSPEAKER 3: Ok, I'll start the recording. Thank. Thank you Speaker 1. Thank you so much., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available.

Are you a big fan of movies?\n00:01:16 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, because I like going in a theater because you got a big bucket of popcorn in it up and like, sense of comedy always makes me laugh.\n00:01:23 Speaker 1\nYes, I love that. Great. Yes, that's great. Speaker 15 can definitely kind of maybe we can. And set. I wonder if you can set an A reminder every time a new movie comes out or something like that. What about what technology or tools such as your TV, phone games, game consoles like, you know, Nintendo or Xbox, do you currently use for entertainment activities?\n00:02:01 Speaker 2\nFor entertainment, I would I use my laptop computer than my cell phone. Yeah, because like, sometimes on my laptop I go to YouTube and it's why I want to listen to music click and I will sometimes like on my phone I scroll through my social media and see what my friends are doing.\n00:02:23 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yes, Speaker 2, do you use any music apps?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nOhh my on my phone I have a Spotify. Is it streaming service. Yeah yeah. Like pay for it but it's music.\n00:02:44 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Yes. So already we have identified 2 applications that we can connect to your Speaker 15 with which is YouTube and Spotify. So those are ones you already. Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it. It kind of curates for YouTube, yeah.\n00:03:14 Speaker 2\nLike what? Like maybe like ohh. You played the artist twice. Then we check out this girl or something.\n00:03:20 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK and. Now for the last question, can you think of about let's think of about 10 scenarios to complete this sentence. OK, so first, let's start with. I want to listen to. And and when you think about this, think about your Speaker 15 device. Yeah.\n00:03:52 Speaker 2\nI would say something like I would like to listen to old folk music. I like older rock and folk music because it is kind of calming melodies and like I'm gonna do some like typing on my computer. It's kind of gentle.\n00:04:08 Speaker 1\nVery nice.\n00:04:08 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:10 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Next is I want to watch.\n00:04:22 Speaker 2\nI would. I would like to watch. YouTube, like YouTube like like playlist of you know, the show Wipeout, there's some YouTube clips like, you know, like people gloss the obstacle course and bounce and stuff that show Wipeout. It was like popular about like 10 years ago, but still on.\n00:04:48 Speaker 1\nThat sounds so fun. I need to check that out.\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's like it currently. A couple like last couple of years and people like you know that show American Ninja Warrior? It's funny.\n00:05:02 Speaker 4\nYou found.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll definitely check it out, I love shows like that because they're kind of competitive. And they always keep you on the edge of your seats.\n00:05:09 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:05:11 Speaker 2\nYeah, like I'm cheering for that guy, but that one.\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. Awesome.\n00:05:19 Speaker 1\nUmm. Let's see. And this could be so the next uh scenario or starter phrase is I want to play and it could be games or anything that you want to think of. Yeah, for you.\n00:05:40 Speaker 2\nOK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n00:06:10 Speaker 1\nThat's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n00:06:23 Speaker 2\nI would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n00:06:37 Speaker 1\nGreat. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n00:07:08 Speaker 5\nSo. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n00:07:25 Speaker 2\nI'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n00:07:38 Speaker 1\nI wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n00:07:57 Speaker 2\nI'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n00:08:27 Speaker 5\nI was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n00:08:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n00:08:53\nAlready.\n00:08:53 Speaker 2\nOn Spotify or something like that.\n00:08:55 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's great.\n00:08:56 Speaker 2\nIce and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n00:09:09 Speaker 1\nOhh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n00:09:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:09:24 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nCan you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n00:10:23 Speaker 1\nSure.\n00:10:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n00:10:33 Speaker 15\nSet for 5:55 PM.\n00:10:36 Speaker 2\nThat's awesome.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nNice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n00:10:57 Speaker 2\nAppointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n00:12:01 Speaker 1\nOh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n00:12:25 Speaker 2\nIt says that you're all caught up.\n00:12:32 Speaker 1\nOh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n00:12:52 Speaker 15\nYeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n00:12:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n00:13:06 Speaker 6\nOK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n00:13:27 Speaker 2\nSo like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n00:13:44 Speaker 1\nYes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n00:13:48 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nIt's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there\u2019s an external, mini brain.\n00:13:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:19 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n00:14:49 Speaker 2\nI think that my alarm is gonna go off soon.\n00:14:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n00:15:08 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, stop alarm.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nPerfect. Yep.\n00:15:11 Speaker 15\n55 PM alarm cancelled.\n00:15:15 Speaker 2\nOhh, I just said it right there.\n00:15:20 Speaker 1\nYou already cancelled it, OK. Well, yeah, she's always listening so.\n00:15:25 Speaker 2\nYeah. And she's like, oh. Yeah, my my sister and the other. Well, actually, my mom in the other room, she, like, had, like, phone. She has Speaker 15 app on her phone. And like, if you say something in there.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. Have have you introduced it to your mom or you said sister? You live with your sister.\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nAnd my younger sister, they they see me or using my room and they come in and say, oh, you have your device.\n00:15:59 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's awesome. And Speaker 5, have you have you tried using Speaker 15 in the the past week at all?\n00:16:10 Speaker 5\nI haven't got a lot of time just because I just got back.\n00:16:16 Speaker 1\nI know. Uh. Speaker 5. Sister got married last week, so it was an exciting month for her. How was it, Speaker 5?\n00:16:19 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:16:26 Speaker 5\nIt it was great. New Jersey Weather is a little bit weird. It will be very foggy. And then there's Thunder storms. But the wedding was great so.\n00:16:31 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:16:37 Speaker 15\nThat's great.\n00:16:39 Speaker 2\nYeah, I I used to fly in and out of Newark cause I would go in Newark to Syracuse. I used to live in upstate New York, and Newark is kind of cold or hot. It's like New Jersey.\n00:16:51 Speaker 5\nRight. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experience that. So.\n00:16:56 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:16:58 Speaker 1\nYeah. Speaker 2, what city do you live in right now?\n00:17:05 Speaker 2\nIrvine, CA yeah live it south and bryan.\n00:17:06 Speaker 1\nOK, very nice. Yeah. Yes. All right. Well, we're gonna go to the main room now. I'll. I'll see you two in there, OK. Great. Bye.\n00:17:22 Speaker 3\nFine.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:17:30 Speaker 7\nOK, welcome back, Speaker 2, giving you a spotlight. Hey, Speaker 8.\n00:17:39 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:17:41 Speaker 7\nGiving you a spotlight too.\n00:17:45 Speaker 8\nI don't know what is spotlight.\n00:17:49 Speaker 7\nSo it gives us ways to actually see you on our screen. Uh, we have a lot of us on zoom, so zoom has this feature that will allow you to be seeing your your face to be seen so your face will be seen first if there is anything you're showing us on your screen.\n00:17:55 Speaker 9\nOK.\n00:18:09 Speaker 7\nYeah. OK, it's Speaker 12 back. Go. Where's Speaker 12?\n00:18:18 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:18:21 Speaker 10\nYeah, I don't see him.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nIs he here?\n00:18:24 Speaker 10\nIt's.\n00:18:28 Speaker 7\nOK. Speaker 12, I think your video is on mute. So I'm gonna request you to have your video back on. OK, Speaker 10. You can probably go ahead and get started.\n00:18:44 Speaker 10\nOK. All right. Just a second. Something went wrong there. Right. All right. Wait, why isn't it coming?\n00:19:25 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:19:26 Speaker 10\nAll right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:21:50 Speaker 15\nUmm.\n00:21:52 Speaker 10\nAll right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n00:22:29 Speaker 1\nCool.\n00:22:31 Speaker 10\nLet's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n00:22:39 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:22:48 Speaker 16\nYou know, his Speaker 6 was muted. Sorry.\n00:22:51\nOh.\n00:22:53 Speaker 10\nThat's fine.\n00:22:55 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n00:23:00 Speaker 6\nHere's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n00:23:10 Speaker 16\nAnd it played a science fact.\n00:23:12 Speaker 10\nOK, perfect. Good job, Speaker 9. Thank you. All right, who wants to go next?\n00:23:16 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:23:23 Speaker 2\nCan I go next?\n00:23:25 Speaker 10\nYes, definitely. Speaker 2, go ahead.\n00:23:32 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 15, tell me an interesting history fact.\n00:23:38 Speaker 15\nHere's a fun fact about Earth. The low, Ethiopia, with an average daily temperature of 94\u00b0F, holds the record for hottest inhabited place on Earth.\n00:23:53 Speaker 2\nWow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n00:23:55 Speaker 10\nThat is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n00:24:09 Speaker 2\nI learned something new today.\n00:24:12 Speaker 10\nSomething new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n00:24:26 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:24:30 Speaker 10\nAlright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n00:24:34 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n00:24:41 Speaker 13\nLock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n00:24:49 Speaker 8\n1345 completed.\n00:24:51 Speaker 10\nThat's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n00:24:57 Speaker 8\nYes, that's. Yes.\n00:25:05 Speaker 10\nSpeaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n00:25:08 Speaker 3\nIs he here now? \n00:25:15 Speaker 7\nSpeaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n00:25:24 Speaker 10\nI don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n00:25:32 Speaker 10\nOK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n00:26:27\nYeah.\n00:26:28 Speaker 10\nAlright, the same as with music.\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nWhere is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n00:26:41 Speaker 13\nShowing result.\n00:26:42 Speaker 8\nTelevision.\n00:26:43 Speaker 13\nYou can narrow down these things.\n00:26:45 Speaker 10\nSo if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n00:27:07 Speaker 8\nOK. OK.\n00:27:17 Speaker 10\nThank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n00:27:19 Speaker 8\nIt has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n00:27:23 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah.\n00:27:28 Speaker 11\nCorrect, correct.\n00:27:28 Speaker 8\nIt has to be synced on the smart TV.\n00:27:33 Speaker 10\nOn the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n00:28:10 Speaker 8\nOK.\n00:28:11 Speaker 10\nRight. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n00:28:21 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:28:22 Speaker 10\nSo I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n00:28:43 Speaker 9\nAnd I.\n00:28:44 Speaker 11\nSpeaker 9, you stay.\n00:28:45 Speaker 10\nYeah, yeah, go ahead.\n00:28:48 Speaker 11\nThere, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n00:28:53 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:01 Speaker 11\nI don't believe she hears you.\n00:29:03 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:07 Speaker 6\nHere you go.\n00:29:09 Speaker 9\nThanks a lot.\n00:29:13 Speaker 16\nAnd it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n00:29:32 Speaker 10\nOK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n00:29:49 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n00:29:57 Speaker 6\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:30:02 Speaker 10\nThere you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n00:30:07 Speaker 8\nYou can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n00:30:10 Speaker 11\nYou.\n00:30:16 Speaker 8\nLogging into streaming service.\n00:30:19 Speaker 10\nYes. Right. So I think.\n00:30:21 Speaker 11\nIt's like.\n00:30:24 Speaker 10\nRight. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n00:30:56 Speaker 8\nYes, OK.\n00:30:57 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:31:00 Speaker 10\nAlright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n00:31:05 Speaker 16\nYeah, we paused it.\n00:31:06 Speaker 10\nOhh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n00:31:15 Speaker 9\nHey Speaker 6, can you play?\n00:31:18 Speaker 11\nThere you go.\n00:31:22 Speaker 10\nAll right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n00:31:47 Speaker 10\nAnd then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n00:32:27 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:36 Speaker 13\nHere is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n00:32:43 Speaker 8\nRaise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n00:33:14 Speaker 9\nYeah.\n00:33:14 Speaker 8\nAnd.\n00:33:17 Speaker 7\nThere you go.\n00:33:18\nAnd I turn everything into a joke.\n00:33:21 Speaker 4\nBut I care.\n00:33:22\nI want to use that.\n00:33:24\nFor something important.\n00:33:25 Speaker 8\nWas. The video but it came.\n00:33:26 Speaker 10\nOK, first back, Speaker 8.\n00:33:31 Speaker 8\nIt changed its name.\n00:33:31 Speaker 11\nThat was so good.\n00:33:34 Speaker 8\n#3, it didn't respond.\n00:33:39 Speaker 10\nAll right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n00:33:53 Speaker 12\nI don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n00:34:00\nOh.\n00:34:01 Speaker 12\nSo I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n00:34:10 Speaker 10\nOh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n00:34:45 Speaker 12\nI guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n00:35:10 Speaker 10\nI think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n00:35:12 Speaker 12\nWell, Speaker 14, can you?\n00:35:17 Speaker 14\nSorry, I don't know that one.\n00:35:21 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n00:35:27 Speaker 13\nI waited a long.\n00:35:29 Speaker 10\nWould you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n00:35:38 Speaker 12\nYou're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n00:35:59 Speaker 10\nOK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n00:36:11 Speaker 12\nOK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n00:36:21 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the game?\n00:36:22 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n00:36:35 Speaker 10\nIs it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n00:36:37 Speaker 12\nIt's not.\n00:36:39 Speaker 10\nOh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n00:36:42 Speaker 2\nThe first one, yeah.\n00:36:44 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:36:46 Speaker 10\nOK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n00:36:46 Speaker 14\nWho's been compromised?\n00:36:57 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n00:37:05 Speaker 14\nHere's the trailer for this.\n00:37:16 Speaker 10\nIs it playing now?\n00:37:18 Speaker 12\nIt is now.\n00:37:20 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n00:37:26 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume up two times.\n00:37:32 Speaker 10\nStole the statue.\n00:37:33 Speaker 12\nSpeaker 14. Volume down to times.\n00:37:40 Speaker 10\nOK, so that worked right?\n00:37:43 Speaker 12\nWell, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n00:37:54 Speaker 10\nI went back. OK all right.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nIt's.\n00:37:57 Speaker 10\nOK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n00:38:00 Speaker 7\nGood job, Speaker 12.\n00:38:06 Speaker 12\nThanks.\n00:38:08 Speaker 10\nOK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n00:38:21 Speaker 7\nYeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n00:38:43 Speaker 7\nBut I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:39:01 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nHey, guys.\n00:39:04 Speaker 1\nAll right. So let me pull, bring back the slides. OK. Can you see my screen?\n00:39:15 Speaker 2\nYes, is week two entertainment, yeah.\n00:39:18\nOK.\n00:39:18 Speaker 1\nPerfect. So we'll go. Speaker 4, I liked your how you asked Speaker 15 for a history fact. I like the fact about Ethiopia. Just learned that today. Yeah, we all learned. Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n00:39:57 Speaker 2\nAnd think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n00:40:03 Speaker 1\nI guess do you did you want to?\n00:40:06 Speaker 4\nLike, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n00:40:14 Speaker 1\nYou know Speaker 2.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nI do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n00:40:19 Speaker 4\nYou know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n00:40:26 Speaker 1\nWell, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n00:40:30 Speaker 4\nYou know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n00:40:37 Speaker 1\nExactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n00:40:44 Speaker 4\nBut they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nOhh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n00:41:28 Speaker 2\nAnd remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n00:41:42 Speaker 15\nI don't have a.\n00:41:45 Speaker 4\nShe's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n00:41:47 Speaker 2\nI think it's twisters with an asset.\n00:41:50 Speaker 4\nOh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n00:42:06 Speaker 1\nWoah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n00:42:43 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:01 Speaker 1\nGreat. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n00:43:07 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n00:43:17 Speaker 1\nShe's good at. She's listening.\n00:43:18 Speaker 4\nYeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n00:43:28 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n00:43:40 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n00:43:46 Speaker 15\nHere's the trailer for twisters.\n00:43:50 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n00:43:56 Speaker 4\nIt went down. Up and down, yeah.\n00:44:03 Speaker 1\nThe great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n00:44:21 Speaker 4\nLike sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n00:44:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n00:44:32 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:44:34 Speaker 1\nAnd then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n00:45:01 Speaker 4\nWell, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n00:45:11 Speaker 1\nSure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n00:45:24 Speaker 4\nI'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n00:45:32 Speaker 1\nThat yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n00:45:43 Speaker 15\nYeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n00:45:55 Speaker 4\nWell, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n00:46:21 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:46:21 Speaker 2\nDoesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n00:46:25 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:36 Speaker 2\nNBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n00:46:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n00:46:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:56 Speaker 1\nShe will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n00:47:04 Speaker 10\nYeah.\n00:47:13 Speaker 1\nThe NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n00:47:20 Speaker 15\nSpeaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n00:47:30 Speaker 6\nHere are some results. Ohh.\n00:47:36 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n00:47:43 Speaker 2\nNo, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nTime ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n00:48:12 Speaker 4\nThink you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n00:48:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:48:17 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n00:48:38 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n00:48:41 Speaker 1\nHey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n00:49:11 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n00:49:17 Speaker 4\nIt's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nOh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n00:49:24 Speaker 4\nYeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n00:49:35 Speaker 1\nOK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n00:49:57 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n00:50:02 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:50:08 Speaker 1\nAre they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n00:50:10 Speaker 4\nOh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n00:50:19 Speaker 1\nOh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n00:50:23 Speaker 4\nYeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n00:50:32 Speaker 15\nThere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:50:40 Speaker 4\nNow I say. And see like he wants you to watch this stream. You're not chasing gold, but it's not the Olympic Games.\n00:50:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah. I think because it probably has the Olympics haven't started, yeah. Yeah, she's probably just showing you, like, relevant, maybe.\n00:51:01 Speaker 4\nYeah, well, close by.\n00:51:05 Speaker 1\nAnd then, Speaker 4, do you want to command Speaker 15 to play one of them? So you can. Yeah, let's see how we can play one of them. Go ahead and ask.\n00:51:18 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play chasing gold, Paris?\n00:51:27 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch Chase Soul, Paris, 2024.\n00:51:43 Speaker 4\nIt gave me the screenplay or?\n00:51:49 Speaker 1\nOh, nice. OK. Is it free to watch? If you press play does will it play?\n00:51:56 Speaker 7\nOK.\n00:52:07 Speaker 4\nIt's not playing with hit watch options.\n00:52:11 Speaker 1\nHmm OK, maybe this is something that you have to watch on.\n00:52:15 Speaker 4\nOhh wait, was like maybe Amazon Prime or something.\n00:52:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, OK. Yeah.\n00:52:30 Speaker 5\nI was going to say if maybe if you're trying to find a video to play, to make sure that you can play it when you're doing the command for Speaker 15, you could say on YouTube.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOhh yeah on YouTube OK.\n00:52:43 Speaker 2\nAnd then it might just pull up YouTube videos.\n00:52:46 Speaker 4\nAlright. Speaker 15, can you play? The.\n00:53:01 Speaker 15\nHere are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n00:53:06 Speaker 4\nShe's still stuck on this game. Well, this move movie chasing gold. So.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nYou can always say Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:16 Speaker 4\nOK, Speaker 15, go home.\n00:53:27 Speaker 4\nNow she went back to this.\n00:53:30 Speaker 1\nOK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n00:54:35 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, can you play a video about speaking Spanish?\n00:54:42 Speaker 15\nHere you go.\n00:55:03 Speaker 4\nIt went on YouTube.\n00:55:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, Speaker 4 did it open YouTube.\n00:55:09 Speaker 4\nIt is opening YouTube right now. So oh right, now it's loading these little videos.\n00:55:16 Speaker 1\nOhh, nice yes, but it.\n00:55:35 Speaker 15\nHola espanol.\n00:55:49 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. I need to. I need to learn Spanish too.\n00:55:50 Speaker 4\nYeah. Like you know here in SoCal it's like.\n00:55:57 Speaker 1\nI know.\n00:55:58 Speaker 4\nYou know, some of the streets it's like. I know that means that's someones last name, it's like an LA Figueroa.\n00:56:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, right.\n00:56:10 Speaker 4\nAre you north? Or south of fig, I'm like.\n00:56:15 Speaker 1\nOhh that's kind of like a slang, yeah.\n00:56:17 Speaker 4\nYeah, it's like it's like it's like like, like, Spanglish from like.\n00:56:20 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:56:24 Speaker 4\nLike LA.\n00:56:27 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right, Speaker 4. So I think you can click on the video to play it, and then let's practice. Pausing and playing the video. Yeah. So on the screen, the commands are on the screen.\n00:56:50 Speaker 4\nPlay this video.\n00:57:10 Speaker 1\nAwesome. And then, Speaker 2, go ahead and pause the video by the command on the screen.\n00:57:19 Speaker 4\nPause the video. Yeah, it stopped.\n00:57:26 Speaker 1\nThat was easy was it? Says pause. Yeah. And then how would you play the video again?\n00:57:34 Speaker 4\nOhh is it Speaker 15? Play the video.\n00:57:40 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found. Oh.\n00:57:44 Speaker 4\nOh.\n00:57:47 Speaker 1\nOh no, that didn't work. OK.\n00:57:55 Speaker 1\nWe may, maybe it start, maybe that's the word. I think I I've run into this problem too now that I think about it, where, where, where she'll start. I mean, she'll go back.\n00:58:14 Speaker 15\nIn espanol.\n00:58:15 Speaker 1\nOK, let's try it again. So pause it and then let's restart it, OK?\n00:58:21 Speaker 4\nPause the video, Speaker 15. Speaker 15, pause the video. Speaker 15, pause the video. Let's pause and then.\n00:58:42 Speaker 1\nWe can try. Let's try start. Let's use the word start. Yeah.\n00:58:47 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, start the video.\n00:58:50 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n00:58:55 Speaker 1\nMaybe it's just start. OK. Yeah. We need we'll need to. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure others are running into the same thing. So it's not just us, OK.\n00:59:01 Speaker 6\nNo, it is true.\n00:59:17 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 4, let's try this one. Do you see my screen? It's. It's fast. Forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:30 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 15, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:59:36 Speaker 15\nFast forward is not supported.\n00:59:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 4, can you? Let's see if this this command works. Speaker 15, play from the beginning.\n01:00:01 Speaker 4\nOK. Speaker 15, can you play from the beginning?\n01:00:05 Speaker 15\nStarting over.\n01:00:06 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, she said. Sorry.\n01:00:07 Speaker 1\nYou know, OK, it's four. OK, that one works. Yeah.\n01:00:10 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:00:19 Speaker 1\nAlright, you're doing a great job, OK? OK, so we're, I know we're almost we're kind of overtime right now, but I just.\n01:00:38 Speaker 4\nAlright, OK.\n01:00:41 Speaker 1\nI wanted to remind you that you can do these commands with music, so increasing increasing the volume, decreasing the volume.\n01:00:45 Speaker 2\nYeah. \n01:00:50 Speaker 1\nPerfect, I think and also pausing starting and fast forwarding, OK and and so yeah, go ahead, maybe even for homework, you can try to play music this time instead of a video and then you can try the commands as well. But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n01:01:21 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh, I was going to ask, though, do does her Speaker 15 need to get program to add the Fast forward? Is that something that?\n01:01:34 Speaker 15\nHere's what I found.\n01:01:35 Speaker 2\nSomeone else would have to do.\n01:01:40 Speaker 1\nOh. It may, it may just it may not be supported specifically on YouTube. UM. I can. Yeah. I will need to also refresh if it's supported. Like if you play the news for example, I'm thinking or maybe on Amazon Prime, it's probably supported, but yeah, that's actually a really good question for our team to kind of go back and test ourselves, so. Yeah.\n01:02:11 Speaker 2\nBut yeah, that was great, Speaker 4.\n01:02:15 Speaker 1\nAll right, let's so we'll just go back to the main room, all right, so. If you. If you go to the three dots on the UM on the bar, and then you press there. Me too. And then you. Ohh sorry. You could do you see? Leave room. On the on the bottom of our zoom screen.\n01:02:43 Speaker 4\nI'll leave room hidden.\n01:02:45 Speaker 1\nAll right, I'll see you. In the main room, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:02:52 Speaker 7\nClinician 10 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n01:02:56 Speaker 11\nPerfect.\n01:02:58 Speaker 7\nHere's the homework for week 1. Hey, Speaker 4, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic. You know, so you can, uh, practice something and record back to us. So see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nOK.\n01:03:33 Speaker 11\nThanks, bye. Thank you., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history.

Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs.

An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading.

How are you doing, Speaker 3?\n00:00:11 Speaker 3\nI'm doing well because today around half day I went over to my community pool with my dad and we did some treading water and like no water. I'm trying to get back into the pool but like just, you know, it's good for me to be in the water. So. I'm happy because of that. \n00:00:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's really great.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nSo Speaker 6 will be coming in a little bit, so we're going to get started without her. Let me just. Pull up. What I need OK. If you're still trying to fix your computer, I can still give you a minute or I can start. Just let me know when you'r ready.\n00:01:08 Speaker 3\nMaybe you can just start or I can like. Stop video and see what happens, and this is the same so they can move. It's that laptop cameras not working OK. But I can just still listen to you.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nOK, Speaker 5 is that is that going to be fine? OK. Perfect. OK. Umm, so we were gonna try to look at what we did last week. So last week we were going through and doing playing music or looking at the videos. So I was going to see if you could show me how to play a music or video from your Speaker 7.\n00:02:00 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, I'm Speaker 7. I I just asked her to like go on YouTube and like, play a song and she just. I just do it that way. Just ask for the YouTube video and she plays it when I just say play this.\n00:02:08 Speaker 1\nYeah. So let's see. So last week you were trying to pull up the Olympic ceremonies. I know it was having a difficult time. Did you want to try to pull that up again? Or try something different.\n00:02:40 Speaker 3\nMaybe I'll try to play some music or something.\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:02:45 Speaker 3\nOK, just ask her, OK? Speaker 7. Can you play Banning CA on YouTube.\n00:02:57 Speaker 7\nWhat you need to?\n00:03:13 Speaker 1\nIt's just still searching?\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's playing right now. Like the YouTube is trying to show you on my phone, but. Just playing the song.\n00:03:23 Speaker 1\nSo I can't. I can't hear it, but I last week we worked on turning the volume up and the volume down. Could you try doing that this time?\n00:03:31 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. OK. Speaker 7, can you turn the volume down? Speaker 7, can you turn the sound up?\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n00:03:56 Speaker 3\nCan you stop the video? So it's in there somewhere. I stopped it. Yeah.\n00:04:05 Speaker 1\nOK, great. I think that was easier than last week too.\n00:04:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, because like you know, I've done it most of the times last week. You know, it's indoor rain somewhere, so I can just do it again.\n00:04:22 Speaker 1\nHave you been working on it throughout the week?\n00:04:26 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, like this. I think it was Tuesday we were playing. Like it it like UM. We're listening. I was asking them Speaker 7 to play another song and this it's like I wanted to listen to it and she pulled it up and it's like. Something to getting used to doing.\n00:04:50 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. That's super and that's super useful.\n00:04:54 Speaker 3\nYeah, I know it's new thing is getting part of my routine and saying make her play song and do.\n00:05:05 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Have you have you set it up to the playlist that you made?\n00:05:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, I just ask Speaker 7 like to go on YouTube and like for an artist and just like it just kind of plays some one night for each other. So I'm just, I just go by artist. Yeah.\n00:05:28 Speaker 1\nOK. Great. Today we're going to be talking about self-care needs. So I wanted to find out what type of self-care or health related activity. Do you have difficulties managing?\n00:05:54 Speaker 3\nWell. Trying to think, well, like selfcare is like when they, like tried to. Like she like, want, like, want to look good in the mirror and look at my do my hair and stuff sometimes. Like ohh. My left arm is kind of weaker at this point in our recovery, so my hair up in a ponytail or headband or something. It's like sometimes it's kind of a struggle to get into place.\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:06:27\nYeah.\n00:06:30 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that can? Be a little bit difficult.\n00:06:37 Speaker 3\nWell, I put a lot of lotion on my skin cause I like being in the pool and chlorine eats her skin, so I put it on a lot and so sometimes like I want to put a lot of lotion on and sometimes it gets like your clothes kind of get too lotiony. It's too much on your it's kind of like on your shirt and stuff like. Too much so. So you have to find it in the middle, like too much or too little.\n00:07:11 Speaker 1\nIs it because you squeeze out too much?\n00:07:14 Speaker 3\nI squeeze out too much and then I go there, put this on my face.\n00:07:19 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. And then you have a lot.\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nOf extra. Yeah. So like, I'll put it back in a plastic bag.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nOK. Anything else that self-care related?\n00:07:39 Speaker 3\nI'm well, I'm trying to. Cut down my process. Food in my diet, to where like my eat more like natural food than fruits and grains, and my diet. Not eating like processed food or fast food or like like frozen meals I'm kind of. And make my diet more healthy, so it's good for my overall health. I'm trying to cut those out of my diet.\n00:08:09 Speaker 1\nOK. And and maybe maybe with the food, do you have any technologies or tools? That can help you manage these needs.\n00:08:24 Speaker 3\nWell, I can. Like. Tell my smartphone to. Like. Read me my my shopping list or then say say it to me out loud and so say if I want to go to the grocery store, I want to get that. Not that. So are you gonna get this this this. So it's like in my mind it backs up and ohh I need to shop for this. Then that one too. So I sometimes use that like I need to make a little list in my phone.\n00:09:03 Speaker 1\nThat's great. Like, I mean, yeah, really useful.\n00:09:07 Speaker 3\nI know. Yeah, I like listening everything cause like my background is in science and protocols are all this usually step by step by step.\n00:09:19 Speaker 1\nDo you typically when you're making the list? UM. Do you? Like is it on your computer or? What do you what do you make? Your list on.\n00:09:35 Speaker 3\nOh, on my like my iPhone, there's a little UM notes app, so like if I'm in my in the store I have my phone with me all the time. I don't have a little. I usually get a piece of paper and write it by hand. But if I have it on my phone, out in public, I can just look at it. But. Trying and I can just hold in my hand and look at that. I need to go down the aisle and. Get some milk or something.\n00:10:00 Speaker 1\nAll right, that's great. And then I was wondering, Speaker 3, when you were talking about squeezing out the lotion. Sometimes it squeezes too much. Is that due to weakness? In your arm.\n00:10:14 Speaker 3\nI think it's a combination of. Like weak arm and also how much pressure I can. I'm supposed to use or. I think it's either too much or too little. It's like just. To like round it out, see like. I think it only did like a little squeeze or that I squeeze it too hard. It's like all of it out.\n00:10:37 Speaker 1\nDo you use one hand or two hands?\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nI always use my left hand, it's dominant, but I probably need to use both to too. So in my head I think it's just one hand and I actually need to use 2.\n00:10:52 Speaker 1\nOK. I mean that makes sense. Sometimes I like to use one hand because it seems convenient, but.\n00:10:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, and that's not what I'm supposed to do.\n00:11:03 Speaker 1\nOK. But that's that's good. And that's the way that you can help manage in the future? UM. OK, let's see. So I have something, but I don't know if you take, do you take medications? You don't have to tell me what or any.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nOhh I take medication regularly. I have a little pill case in my bathroom I take I have daily doses to take, yeah.\n00:11:33 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to think of. 10 scenarios to complete this the sentence, so I want to learn to manage my medications. Or slash take care of myself more about. Let's see. So I read the question kind of funny. OK, so I want to learn how to manage my medications or take care of myself more about.\n00:12:28 Speaker 6\nHi. Sorry I'm. I'm so sorry I'm late. I've been commuting to Rancho every single day so. But. Where's Speaker 3?\n00:12:40 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm actually having some camera issues, but I'm here.\n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nOK. Hi, Speaker 3. \n00:12:44 Speaker 3\nHi, Speaker 6. \n00:12:44 Speaker 6\nHello.\n00:12:51 Speaker 1\nWe were just going to try and work on coming up with some sentences about managing our medication or self-care. So is there anything that you want to maybe have to learn to manage medications or anything that you think would help?\n00:13:21 Speaker 3\nWell. I I say I take daily medication for my. I have like dose. I got regular dosage ofpills for like anti seizure meds and  I just need to take them twice daily so maybe I need to put like alarms on my phone for the times it's supposed to go and like oh, I know that that's for that.\n00:13:50 Speaker 1\nOK, so alarms you said two times a day.\n00:13:52 Speaker 3\nYeah, I take one early morning, one late night. Yeah. So I have twice a day pills for anti seizure.\n00:14:00 Speaker 1\nOK. So doing an alarm.\n00:14:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, alarm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nAll right. And then. Are there other things for managing that? There's other aspects besides medication that you think for self-care that maybe you can have something, maybe Speaker 7 help manage?\n00:14:36 Speaker 3\nMaybe like I have like well alarms would be like you know I have physical therapy appointments or speech sessions like maybe I'll ask her to. Like makes me have like. A. A reminder like 30 minutes before or something cause like my PD clinic is like like a couple streets away from my house. So I need to like the little time to get ready.\n00:15:04\nYes.\n00:15:07 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. And then maybe if we're trying to come up with something for uh. Like maybe another thing to help with like if you have your medications for taking besides like just an alarm for time, we could have it set up something about the dosage instructions or potential side effects.\n00:15:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, I could just maybe ask her to do a reminder of like, UM. Check the like when we check the side of the bottle or something like that. So like they have a little medicine like like little fact sheet about what this is for. Yeah. Maybe like right, maybe about like 20 minutes before. I'm just taking this look, look at the side of the bottle or something like that.\n00:16:12 Speaker 1\nDo you is do you always take the same amount of the same medication?\n00:16:18 Speaker 3\nCurrently, but my neurologist, he said in like a week or two he's gonna, like, face out one and switch it with another. So I need to. I'm in like transition right now. So I'm it's like in the next couple weeks I'm going to like switch one out and get a new one.\n00:16:41 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.  So for that one, will the dosage change?\n00:16:48 Speaker 3\nWell, the dosages would change like one postman faced out and then one is building up this new one is. So this is will be going up.\n00:16:57 Speaker 1\nOK. Are you going to take it the same amount of times a day?\n00:17:02 Speaker 3\nOh yeah, it's both twice a day, but they're on the new pill is higher now and the I'm phasing out the old one that was on SO1 going up, one going down.\n00:17:16 Speaker 1\nAll right, so we could set up something that will because it's going to be a new dosage, maybe to remind you about what dosage to take possibly.\n00:17:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good reminder.\n00:17:33 Speaker 1\nIs there anything else that you that could help you manage the medication or manage you know, other aspects of self-care? That we talked about.\n00:17:49 Speaker 3\nWell, I think that those are my 2. Issues in self-care right now, like with this weakness, weakness and like on my left side. But I wanna try to do my hair or put it in a ponytail or back behind my face like I'm trying to do it evenly. But this left side. Not always there. And then taking my daily medication, then sticking to this like the doses aren't supposed to be on right now. And also I'm I'm supposed to be doing daily stretches for my PT clinic to make my body open up. So I think they need to get reminders for that too.\n00:18:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, yeah, that would be great.\n00:18:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because I have a little packet. They gave me a little like, oh, do this one do this one they like. I'm supposed to actually do them. Speaker 7 reminds me of it. OK, you. Need to do it.\n00:18:51 Speaker 1\nSorry, I froze for a second, so I wasn't sure what happened. Go ahead, sorry.\n00:19:12 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's like it was. It was breathing for me. Breaking up for me a little bit. These are great. I just want to make sure we also ask. Sorry, I sorry, I missed the beginning. Have we asked Speaker 3 the goals yet or what her goal is or? Oh, we have, OK.\n00:19:36 Speaker 1\nWhat her goal is?\n00:19:38 Speaker 6\nSo. Yes, so we can. So, Speaker 3, what is your goal with Speaker 7? What do you hope to use Speaker 7 for?\n00:19:51 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm well. Currently I'm trying to do. I have my cell phone having alarms and daily planned activities like, you know, go to the USC election meeting it makes like a little noise and I need to have my Speaker 7 like back her up too or something. Ohh, go to your like tomorrow over at Chapman has Irvine campus. I live in Irvine so I go to PT over there, so about like. 45 minutes before. I just need to go get dressed, so maybe I can have Speaker 7 give me reminders and I'll I'll do this then.\n00:20:32 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:20:34 Speaker 3\nSo I just like how, UM, the Alex. I'm trying to use here right now. It's like I have my alarms and my reminders on my phone but need to have when you have two things telling you what to do is easier.\n00:20:49 Speaker 6\nYes, I think Speaker 7 is a great tool for you, especially when you're at home and it gives you that extra reminder to, you know, tie your hair or check. Yeah. Check. You know, 30 minutes before you have your PT session remind you to get ready. Like, oh, it's time to get ready. Yeah. OK.\n00:21:11 Speaker 3\nI need to get ready and leave. Yeah, because like you know, PT or a different album, there's like a speech that we can wear jeans and a top PD and wear your leggings and your hair in the back and the bun. And like, like fitness shoes. It's like it's different.\n00:21:29 Speaker 6\nTrue, right? OK reminders or?\n00:21:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, because my different appointments are different. You need to look different ways.\n00:21:46 Speaker 6\nThat's right. All right. Everything looks great, so I wonder if the other. Groups are done. But yeah, how are how are both your weeks so far?\n00:22:08 Speaker 3\nI'm I'm happy because. Feels like, you know, actual summer like. Kind of hot, but I like it.\n00:22:16 Speaker 6\nYeah, me too. I love the hot, the warm weather. What about you, Speaker 1?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, it's been great. It does feel like summer's coming to me because. Yeah. Yeah.

That's awesome so. Yeah. Is. Yeah. Speaker 16 is in this in this uh and uh. OK. Yeah. So you're graduating and same same class as me, I guess so, yeah, that's also. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And then Speaker 3, how have you been? Kind of how have your therapy sessions been going?\n00:23:41 Speaker 3\nWell. I do a lot of therapy sessions because I live in Irvine and Chapman University has a Irvine campus for like biotech and like also like nursing school and like speech, SRP's like speech, language and so like I go there for a lot of things and. Well, they're on summer break right with summer session. So it's and like working on my socializing with them like, you know, they're my peers. So I'm just trying to make make my summer like progress towards like socializing with, like, people my own age, like in the future when I return to lab work, like, I'll be around people my own age, so that's my goal right now.\n00:24:23 Speaker 6\nWell, that's awesome. I love that, good goals to work towards. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go back to the main room so we can learn some more skills about medication, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:25:23 Speaker 4\nAlright, if thank everyone's back, I'm going to share my screen again and we're going to practice a couple and then we'll go back into our breakout rooms. OK so. It's going to be a two-part command, but first we're going to use our Lexa to create a medication list for the sake of practicing as a group. We can do like a over the counter medication like by Advil or Tylenol as practice. So does anyone want to go first?\n00:26:09 Speaker 8\nWell, I can do it. Speaker 13. Give me a. Tell. Naproxen. Pill.\n00:26:25 Speaker 13\nAre you trying to shop for Naproxen pill?\n00:26:28 Speaker 8\nYes.\n00:26:32 Speaker 13\nOne moment. Showing results from Naproxen Pill. The first one is Amazon Basic care back and muscle pain. Naproxen Sodium tablets, 220 milligrams, 90 count.\n00:26:50 Speaker 8\nOK, they. She wants me to pick up that naproxen pill, so that's good. I I can. Maybe I didn't. Tell our ask. Properly. I'll do it again.\n00:27:17 Speaker 4\nAnd Speaker 8, the there is an example on the right here. So say the wake up word and then create my medication list and then you could use that medication name you just mentioned.\n00:27:30 Speaker 8\nOK. Speaker 7. Create my. Medication list. And I want it. On. Not.\n00:27:46 Speaker 7\nCreate a list called medication right?\n00:27:51 Speaker 4\nIt picked up. Yep, he dropped it, picked up the first command. So we created the list. So now as a follow up you could add that name.\n00:27:51 Speaker 8\nSpeaker 7.\n00:28:01 Speaker 13\nRight.\n00:28:02 Speaker 8\nRight. Give me an aspirin. How's that?\n00:28:09 Speaker 13\nI've created medication list. What would you like to add to it?\n00:28:14 Speaker 8\nAspirin.\n00:28:17 Speaker 13\nI've added aspirin to your medication list. What else?\n00:28:26 Speaker 8\nCough drops.\n00:28:30 Speaker 13\nI've added cough drops to your medication list.

So it will ask those follow up questions just like that. And then how you responded when you added those specific examples? It's a great job, OK. Does anyone want to go next in creating their medication list?\n00:28:59 Speaker 2\nI will go. Speaker 14, create my medication list. Compounded hormones. Heart medication. Supplements. Sleep. I have all these medication profiles. Compounded hormones. R DHEA. Thyroid. Progesterone, estrogen cream, testosterone cream.\n00:29:43 Speaker 4\nDid did it pick up? The command did anything come up on the screen when you said that? OK, so how about first let's try that again. Let's first create that medication list.\n00:29:53 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, create my medication list.\n00:30:06 Speaker 14\nCreate a list called medication, right? Yes.

It has the same screen.\n00:31:18 Speaker 4\nYou could try that again. Say the wake up wake word and then say I'm all done. Maybe see if that.\n00:31:26 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, all done now.\n00:31:29 Speaker 14\nI'm not sure.\n00:31:32 Speaker 4\nOr how about?\n00:31:33 Speaker 2\nAll done now. Creating medication. Lists. Speaker 14's all done now.\n00:31:47 Speaker 14\nSorry, I'm not sure.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:31:51 Speaker 4\nOK, say the wake wake word again. Say go home.\n00:31:57 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 14, go home. It the screen turned off.\n00:32:06 Speaker 4\nDid it turn off? Yes. OK, so it's back. Do you see the main display again now? Yes, OK. Perfect.

Speaker 1, I can share my I can share the screen and then do you want to go ahead and? Should we go through the commands? So let me share my screen real quick. Oh.\n00:40:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, because I have the slides cause I.\n00:40:30 Speaker 6\nYou have the slides. Do you mind sharing? Can you share them? Because I don't have permission at the moment. Or I can ask Speaker 5.\n00:40:42 Speaker 1\nIt's saying that I can.\n00:40:45 Speaker 6\nOhh share screen OK. Yes you can. OK perfect.\n00:40:50 Speaker 6\nOK. \nAnd then I will note, oh, are you just OK?\n00:40:53 Speaker 1\nIt won't let me. Yeah, because I'm disabled too.\n00:40:58 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, if you're sending reminders, that's one of the things that you mentioned earlier, Speaker 3.\n00:41:09 Speaker 3\nThat to make it ohh I need this need to be ready for this in like 45 minutes or something to like flash on my screen. I'll need to get ready for PT or something.\n00:41:25 Speaker 6\nYes. Should we try that? Speaker 3, do you want to try that right now and set a a, maybe a reminder. So let's do. Do you want to do 30 minutes before your PT session?\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right, so. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder for 12:00 PM tomorrow for PT in an half hour?\n00:41:53 Speaker 7\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:41:56 Speaker 3\n12:00 PM.\n00:41:59 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at noon.\n00:42:04 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nAlright, I did it. Yeah, it says.\n00:42:09 Speaker 4\nNice.\n00:42:12 Speaker 3\nFriday, August 2nd at noon. So I have to get ready for. PC at that time.\n00:42:19 Speaker 6\nAwesome.\n00:42:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:42:23 Speaker 6\nYeah. So the PT session starts at 12:30.\n00:42:26 Speaker 3\nWell, it's they want me there around like. So it actually starts at 12:45, but it's nice like they give myself 1/2 an hour to get ready and the only out of the door by 12:30. So like.\n00:42:39 Speaker 6\nOh. Ohh good.\n00:42:41 Speaker 3\nWhenever the you know the clinicians have to be there on time at to meet them at the door. So say I need a little time.\n00:42:48 Speaker 6\nYeah, good. I love how you already strategized and kind of gave yourself enough time to get ready and yeah, you.\n00:42:57 Speaker 3\nIt's good for me to plan. I need time for that. Customers like. Well PT like. You have to. Well, I try to look presentable because it's PT you wear, like your sweats and like, not really that attractive but like. I want to look like. You know, athleisure, it's like kind of like trendy workout plans, but but that is because they, they know that a team of clinicians are my peers. So I want to look fashionable in my own head.\n00:43:30 Speaker 6\nOhh yeah. Well, that's always. Yeah. I mean it's always, I mean you feel better too if you kind of like, yeah, absolutely.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's confidence. Yeah, I'm going to do this and like, I need half an hour to get ready.\n00:43:45 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know. Women, we need our time to get ready.\n00:43:51 Speaker 3\nIf you need your time and like you know, I have to put my hair up in a ponytail. That. Looks. No straight line behind my head because like you know, sometimes those PT clinicians comes and just put you on your back on the pad. It's like you wanna hang your hair out of the way?\n00:44:07 Speaker 6\nYeah. Oh, yeah. Speaker 3, I can see you already thinking about. Everything and you, you have all your outfits for different therapy sessions. I like that you're very organized. You're very.\n00:44:18 Speaker 3\nI'm really organized. I'm I'm a scientist, so I can think everything has to be. It's categorizing. Everything has a box to stick it.\n00:44:27 Speaker 6\nI love that. OK. All right. Let's go back to our slide. All right. I think we are on this one. OK. All right. Go ahead, Speaker 1, we can kind.\n00:44:44 Speaker 1\nOK, sure. So kind of like the the alarm you just set, this one's going to be specific for the medication like the medication you mentioned for that you take for seizures, yeah. So you can try that command. They wrote it up here and you can try it with that medication.\n00:45:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Speaker 7. Remind me to take Keppra at 7:00 AM.\n00:45:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, that was good. That was like my morning dose. Yeah, it's on there, it says.\n00:45:35 Speaker 1\nOK, good. And you can do the same thing?\n00:45:38 Speaker 3\nFor the night dose, yeah. Speaker 7, can you set a reminder? For taking my my nightly medicine Keppra at 7:00 PM. 7:00 PM.\n00:46:03 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 7:00 PM.\n00:46:09 Speaker 3\nWell, it seems like she has both. Of them now.\n00:46:12 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great.\n00:46:15 Speaker 3\nYeah. If I say if I string it like word by word, she had to follow it like that.\n00:46:22 Speaker 1\nThat's OK. Yeah. Sometimes the way we say it, she'll she'll want us to say it in a specific way, but that's good. So now you two alarm set for every day.\n00:46:34 Speaker 3\nYeah, every day. Yeah.\n00:46:37 Speaker 1\nOK, great.\n00:46:38 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:46:43 Speaker 6\nShould we move on to the next one? Let's try this one.\n00:46:53 Speaker 1\nOK, so this one when we you need to find an over the counter medication so you can if you're trying to look for a specific medication, you can ask Speaker 7 where to find that medication so. What medication would you want to find?\n00:47:16 Speaker 3\nProbably would like to find like Tylenol like pain reliever like. Maybe I\u2019ll just command her.\n00:47:25 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:47:25 Speaker 3\nOh, OK, Speaker 7. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:47:34 Speaker 7\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy, who is 6 miles away on campus Drive and 1:50 right in. .7 miles away on Culver Drive, Urban Medical Center pharmacy 6.3 miles away on 7th Ave. St. 101 you can ask me for things like what's the address for the first one?\n00:48:04 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options where I can buy it.\n00:48:09 Speaker 6\nNice, I know. And she even read you the addresses.\n00:48:12 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's like, well, I've gone to that one before. It's like right down the street from my house.\n00:48:17 Speaker 6\nOh, good. She's pretty accurate, right? Yeah.\n00:48:21 Speaker 3\nI like how she's like spot on because like, my brain is analytical like that. So I can I like how she sticks to it.\n00:48:30 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK, great. Well, yeah that I think that's really helpful that way. You know if you know that you can't have to go to a close one, then she tells you how far it. Is so then you can the one that. It's close.\n00:48:50 Speaker 3\nOr like sometimes I go to like. I mean, I'm going to like a session now, I guess like my PT clinic is on the right and that one right there is on the route just to get it on the way or something like that.\n00:49:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that would be super, super helpful.\n00:49:07 Speaker 3\nYou know, because like, well sometimes like. They make me work at PT, so maybe on the way back I need to get. Some Tylenol.\n00:49:18 Speaker 6\nNice.\n00:49:21 Speaker 1\nSo, Speaker 3, do you do your laundry?\n00:49:24 Speaker 3\nI do, but I I just took time. I've been right now I don't have a lot right now, but sometimes like, well, I have a little bin. If it's full, I can do one little. But it's only about like half full right now, so. I usually when my bin is full, I can stick it in. It's like 1 load per bin so.\n00:49:46 Speaker 1\nOK. Do you just wait till it gets full or do you do it? You know, once a week or once a month or.\n00:49:55 Speaker 3\nI usually rely on my bin like cause it's a size about like one load and usually I have. It's just like I usually label everything is like color like colors and cotton cause like it washes everything even though something so like. Different kinds of fabric. When you wash it all together, I have like a dyed a towel with a cut, cut, cut color in it. I have white underwear. They get dyed.\n00:50:30 Speaker 1\nSo do you read it?\n00:50:32 Speaker 3\nYes, and I use separate and then also I do my sheets once a month like the sheets in my bed. So I have to do that load by itself like with like a hot wash like hot temperature because like. It's cotton and it it kills like stuff on my bed and needs to get it. Clean.\n00:50:54 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, that's great. OK. So this one, the first step is how to do laundry. So I know you do your own laundry, but we can ask Speaker 7 and see how Speaker 7 says to do laundry.\n00:51:09 Speaker 3\nOK, I\u2019ll try. OK Speaker 7. How do I do my laundry? She gave me a couple. Then you click on or maybe select number one.\n00:51:32 Speaker 4\nThanks.\n00:51:37 Speaker 3\nOK, so Speaker 7 select number 1.\n00:51:44 Speaker 7\nFrom nearly dark 18. To give stretch things out of white clothing, use a one to one ratio of dish soap, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, and enough water to soak. A shallow bucket works well. Once the item is soaked for 30 minutes, washer is usually when you're ready to do laundry, zip it and tossing the load.\n00:52:11 Speaker 3\nWell, she just read to me about how to. Wash UM sweat stains out of UM like white clothing and using like a a combo of baking soda and and soap and hydrogen peroxide. Different like ratios and you say? Ohh stick it in.\n00:52:32 Speaker 1\nThat's really helpful.\n00:52:33 Speaker 3\nYou know, it's like, well, it's really I liked how it's really different like you know, when you have a scientific procedure different like it's like different parts of it like you have got the whole like procedures, then you have the the beginning, this and this and this it is scientific.\n00:52:59 Speaker 6\nI love that. It's all, it's all like analogy, right? They're all analogy, yeah.\n00:53:12 Speaker 1\nOK, so I was thinking that we could try to set a reminder for to do it at a specific time because you do your sheets once a month. Maybe you can have Speaker 7. You can pick a date and then just have Speaker 7 tell you on that date.\n00:53:30 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:53:33 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7. Can you set a reminder for me to do my laundry on August 15th?\n00:53:43 Speaker 7\nWhat time should I remind you?\n00:53:49 Speaker 3\n8:00 AM.\n00:53:51 Speaker 7\nOK, I'll create a reminder for August 15th at 8:00 AM.\n00:53:57 Speaker 3\nWell, she just made a reminder for me, she said. 8:00 AM on August. August 15th, halfway through the month, and. I have no appointments during that early morning time.\n00:54:13 Speaker 1\nOh, perfect.\n00:54:14 Speaker 3\nIt worked for my schedule.\n00:54:18 Speaker 1\nThat's great.\n00:54:22 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 3, on the Speaker 7 screen, does it say laundry as the name of the reminder or? Maybe you can ask Speaker 7 to. Show you your reminders. Alright? Yeah.\n00:54:43 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 7, can you show me my reminders?\n00:54:55 Speaker 6\nDo you? Do you see one that says laundry on August 15th, or it's just a blank?\n00:55:00 Speaker 3\nIt's no, it's there's a bunch of them, so it says on August 15th. Do my laundry 8:00 AM and then. And. So every Thursday at like 520 prepare for Trojan space and then. Friday. Tomorrow it says. Half an hour PT, so it's 12:00 PM. Half an hour. That's like a reminder and then. I have my dosage. For taking my meds in the morning and night time, so I think there's about. Looks like there's about six things in the reminder list for me now. So I'm happy.\n00:56:00 Speaker 6\nThat's awesome. And you did them all. Yeah, I think you.\n00:56:05 Speaker 3\nWe may have a step by step. It's easier for me to think that way.\n00:56:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, you set them all up very nicely. Very good. OK, next one.\n00:56:18 Speaker 1\nOK, so we can do the stains out. You kind of did that one when you asked how they did the laundry, she kind of told you how to get. The stains out. Maybe we can try the one about fabric softener.\n00:56:40 Speaker 3\nUhm, OK, I'll try the command, OK. Hey. Speaker 7. When do I use fabric softener?\n00:56:59 Speaker 7\nEvery cycle, but it is usually recommended to use it every few washes.\n00:57:06 Speaker 3\nWow, she just told me that. It's used in every cycle or. Can we rotate it like recommended every two or? Every, every other wash and. Every like and as needed. So to add your fabric softener thing. It's like kind of your own choice you do you need it or you can just let it go.\n00:57:31 Speaker 1\nOh, OK. Do you use fabric softener?\n00:57:41 Speaker 3\nYes, if like the item we're trying to wash. Can be kind of like like stretched out. So I need to make it. So some things need to be a little crisp anywhere.\n00:57:57 Speaker 1\nOK, that's great. Let's try the next one. OK, so this one. So if your head's really hurting and you have a headache or a migraine. We can try to ask Speaker 7 how to how do we would treat that.\n00:58:20 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK, cool. Speaker 7, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:58:29 Speaker 7\nThere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for migraine food applying ice packs to the back of the head with temple taking and not taking a warm shower or bath inside, drinking water resting, and with physical therapy.\n00:58:52 Speaker 3\nOhh, she just read off things to do. You have migraine symptoms and different techniques you can do like put ice on the back of your neck or go to PT clinic and. Like soothe yourself.\n00:59:09 Speaker 1\nDo you ever get migraines?\n00:59:12 Speaker 3\nI actually do not get migraines.\n00:59:15 Speaker 1\nOK, good.\n00:59:17 Speaker 3\nBut some people do. It's like a lot of people.\n00:59:21 Speaker 1\nYeah, those are good ways to help if you if you do get migraines. But even if you get a headache they might help.\n00:59:26 Speaker 3\nYeah, like it's good to like. Like sometimes you just want to like, listen to some chill music and just. Check out.\n00:59:39 Speaker 5\nYeah, that could help too.\n00:59:41 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like when they're doing a lot of other things with my day, sometimes you have to take a break.\n00:59:50 Speaker 1\nYeah, that's really helpful. OK. Should we try another one? OK, this one's for stomach pains, OK.\n00:59:58 Speaker 3\nI'll try, OK. Speaker 7. What do I take for stomach pains?\n01:00:08 Speaker 7\nI don't know that one.\n01:00:12 Speaker 3\nHe just said. I don't know that one.\n01:00:20 Speaker 1\nWell, let's see. So what? What is something we could take for stomach pain? There's medicine like.\n01:00:31 Speaker 3\nLike anti acid or something like that like so everyone has different pains.\n01:00:38 Speaker 1\nI think wasn't there when you put on your medication list.\n01:00:41 Speaker 3\nOhh, like Tylenol? Like a pain med.\n01:00:45 Speaker 7\nInteractive adventures with character.\n01:00:47 Speaker 1\nOr Pepto bismol.\n01:00:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, Pepto bismol.\n01:00:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, that I think might have been on that list too. So we could read the list off of like medications that you would take. Help remember.\n01:01:06 Speaker 3\nYeah. Speaker 7, can you read me my medication list?\n01:01:19 Speaker 7\nI don't know.\n01:01:21 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just read it to me. Pepto Bismol and Tylenol.\n01:01:29 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah.\n01:01:31 Speaker 3\nShe she read it.\n01:01:34 Speaker 1\nOK, great. Should we try one more?\n01:01:41 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n01:01:43 Speaker 1\nOK, so for this one it says finding a specific healthcare provider, so we could probably tell Speaker 7 what kind of doctor give a like, what kind of doctor would you want to find?\n01:01:56 Speaker 3\nI'm probably a good dentist, so you specific Doctor. OK, I command her OK. Speaker 7. Find me a dentist.\n01:02:13 Speaker 7\nFound a few options for them. It was Spring Hills Dentistry 5.6 miles away on Newport, Dr. Irving Children's Dentistry 2.7 miles away on Culver, Dr. E University Park Dental 4.1 miles away on university.\n01:02:35 Speaker 3\nWell, she just gave me three options for different choices for dental care in my area. Even though I think my dentist is farther farther away but it's just good to read those options to.\n01:02:49 Speaker 1\nYeah. And I think if you asked her again, she could like to find more. She could umm, search, search for more. Yeah. Or if you, I think search for your dentist. She could probably tell you where that is too.\n01:03:05 Speaker 3\nAll right. We will try to ask. Speaker 7. Can you? Look for Irvine dental.\n01:03:20 Speaker 7\nFound in Irvine Dental. Irvine Dental was 4.8 miles away.\n01:03:25 Speaker 3\nI just found it.\n01:03:29 Speaker 1\nGreat.\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nYeah, she just wrote me the address and. It just said it's currently closed because it actually stops at six and it says, well, it gave me the address and the suite where it's at so. I go there sometimes, like every couple months, so if I need to like check up or. I have a cavity. I don't like that, but it sends you to get it pulled. \n01:03:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense. Well, that's great. And next time you go, maybe you can use Speaker 7 to help with the address and have the address\n01:03:30 Speaker 3\nLike sometimes, like, well, when my mom drives somewhere, I can just plug it into her like. She puts her little. Map thing and Google Maps and just type in the address and go.\n01:04:22 Speaker 1\nYeah. That's great.\n01:04:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n01:04:37 Speaker 6\nThose are all the commands. And Speaker 3, you did them with 100% accuracy, so that was great.\n01:04:43 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n01:04:51 Speaker 6\nOK, I think we are good to go back to the main room. OK, OK.\n01:05:02 Speaker 5\nOK, I'm going to stop the breaker room. Good job. Nice work, Speaker 3. I really feel like you can utilize this on top of everything that you've been using.\n01:05:13 Speaker 3\nI have my phone alarms and now have my Speaker 7 back it up, yeah.\n01:05:19 Speaker 5\nFeel free to pick your preferred ones because we don't want you to fully cover and drop what you've been doing. OK? Yeah, just pick what's easy for you.\n01:05:21 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n01:05:34 Speaker 5\nHi everyone.\n01:05:42 Speaker 5\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will. Be oh, I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slides a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So I expect another homework for this week on self-care information. Just just to double check, did you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two? You got all the slides. I know, Speaker 8. You got it, Speaker 10. You got it. OK, Speaker 2, you got it too.\n01:06:21 Speaker 8\nYep.\n01:06:25 Speaker 2\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n01:06:34 Speaker 5\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Laura, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our PowerPoint train. OK, so after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be any time, but if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd the. So think week six if you go by numbers in your head. Week six, we would like to hear from you just. We will ask you some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well. You can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share together because. Chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel feel free to bring them as well. And I will send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n01:08:17 Speaker 8\nOK.\n01:08:18 Speaker 7\nAny questions?\n01:08:20 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8, we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 8, if you still wanted to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and then we'll let you go. I promise.\n01:08:32 Speaker 5\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can be brief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday. Bye.\n01:08:52 Speaker 9\nAll right, Speaker 8, I'm going to open the breakout.\n01:08:54 Speaker 5\nRoom. OK. Oh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 8 and Speaker 11 and Speaker 12 can go. And don't forget to record.\n01:09:04 Speaker 6\nOK.\n01:09:06 Speaker 8\nYou want me to join or not?\n01:09:08 Speaker 5\nYes, Speaker 8, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going to change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Speaker 16.\n01:09:30 Speaker 6\nYay, great job. OK, stop.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** R.T.  \n**Date:** 08-01-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** Group Therapy / 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses a desire to improve self-care management and medication adherence.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nR.T. is a [age not specified] year-old patient who reports feeling well after engaging in physical activity at the community pool.

Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.\nQuery: What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-24 (Week 4) R.T.

Appointments.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nOK, very good. Alright, so have you been able to access the homework link OK. Or.\n00:00:18 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, umm the you. I have like e-mail thread from like the like. The Speaker 3 study and my e-mail. I just click it. Yeah. And I can put it, it goes up in my browser I can just type it.\n00:00:22 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:00:27 Speaker 1\nOK. OK, good. So you can, UM, I think there's some questions and then you can like record yourself.\n00:00:36 Speaker 2\nYeah, and take a video and submit.\n00:00:38 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yeah. I thought that was such a cool platform. I never worked with that. And I was like, wow, this. Is really.\n00:00:45 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:00:47 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK. Me. OK, so Speaker 2 today the topic is news and facts, so kind of talking about like asking Speaker 3 to schedule. You don't like turning on the news and telling us what's going on. Do you have any goals? In terms of. Using Speaker 3 for news and facts.\n00:01:21 Speaker 2\nIf there's like something important going on like the Olympics or like an election a couple weeks, like maybe I can ask her, like, how are the polls in California or something like that? Or I live in California, just like Orange County or something like that. And maybe, like, I can ask, like, who won the 100m? Dash to the Olympics like you know, people are like here say ohh Noah Lyles like. Like that guy? There's some other guys.\n00:01:51 Speaker 1\nBut yeah, I actually watched the documentary about Noah Lyles on Netflix, so I was, like, amazed. And then, yeah.\n00:01:59 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:02:02 Speaker 1\nDo you watch Netflix, Speaker 2?\n00:02:05 Speaker 2\nI think, well, my mom has, like, every different streaming. So like always has checked her here and there.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. There's so many Netflix documentaries now on the Olympic athletes like Simone Biles, and yeah, the sprinters and stuff. Awesome. OK. Genevieve, would you like to take it away? Is your needs OK? OK.\n00:02:31 Speaker 4\nSure. So also I was just writing in the goal and then it just got. Deleted. Oh, is it? I'm not sure. I think I just pressed something.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nAnd delete it. OK, maybe can you do undo and see if it comes back up?\n00:02:54\nIt's not.\n00:02:57 Speaker 4\nI can rewrite it.\n00:02:58 Speaker 1\nOhh that's OK I I. Got it you can proceed.\n00:03:02 Speaker 4\nOK. All right. So first we kind of you kind of just talked about it, but what type of information do you want to listen to the news floor?\n00:03:16 Speaker 2\nWell, if there's like, you know, a big event like, no, everyone's talking about or like you heard it on other platforms like social media or something. Ohh, what do you think about this Olympic racer or some kind of like running topic that, you know, sports or? Like something like, you know, people, you know, people don't wanna, like, talk about elections. But like, sometimes it comes in your head. You wanna talk about it? So maybe you can just like, maybe ask her something about like. Like you know, this year's Olympics, you may have break dancing. Maybe like we'll ask her, like, who's the women's break dancing for the US? I don't know how to.\n00:04:02 Speaker 4\nHey, that's awesome. I'm sorry. Dance.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nThe Champions? Yeah. Or maybe they're like, maybe like the athlete or whoever they want to do it, OK.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nAll right. And then what topics are you interested in discussing or learning more about, like there's cars or fishing or sports or health? Is there anything that you you wanna find out more about?\n00:04:36 Speaker 2\nWell, I like water sports, swimming and surfing.\n00:04:41 Speaker 4\nOK. Do you want to learn more about swimming and surfing? Is there anything else you want to learn more about?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nWell, like science are like recent science like.\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nLike news or like, you know, my background is in genetics like lab testing. So like you know there's like something called crisper. It's like like doing individual medicine by altering people's genes. So send this to some like the front page news. So it's like. Wow. Yeah, it's in there somewhere.\n00:05:23 Speaker 4\nSo you'd want us ask about it so that Speaker 3 could maybe expand on that. Yeah. So how would you ask that question?\n00:05:35 Speaker 2\nAlright, maybe make a call, say her name, and then say. I think. Are there not? Don't always say that I'm. Is there any news about gene editing currently or something like that?\n00:05:54 Speaker 4\nOK, great. Alright, yeah. I wish I knew more about that.\n00:06:06 Speaker 2\nI know like no. Currently there's some people who have, like, a family trait, like sickle cell anemia. They cut it as soon as they got, like, cut it out of the genome or some people they call, they get designer babies. They try to edit their baby when they when they're born they want like perfect, you know, types thing. Some people do that not me, but it's out there, right.\n00:06:36 Speaker 4\nOK. So can you think of 10 scenarios to complete the sentence? I want to ask or know more about?\n00:06:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:06:49 Speaker 4\nSo is there like 10 things you want to learn more about?\n00:06:55 Speaker 2\nI will. I want to learn more about the US break dancing team. Or Olympic break dancing team. And then maybe say. Who is the US athlete athlete in the 100m butterfly? And then. UM. Who is the? Female US Olympian in the 100 meter dash. It's running then. Are there is it? Are there any Olympic pair break break dancing? I didn't think it was this different categories and sports was like single and double so.\n00:08:02 Speaker 4\nYeah. Is there any non sports related things that you wanted to learn about?\n00:08:10 Speaker 2\nUM. Well, like you know, sometimes there's some stuff like. My son is on TV. That was like like. Well, sometimes is like a bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever's on TV. And like, they will see who it is now. It's like, it's like, want to talk about it? I'm just like, it's usually the same script, but just different guys.\n00:08:36 Speaker 4\nRight, yeah. Been up to date.\n00:08:40 Speaker 2\nYeah, she would like. Ohh. Like shows like that.\n00:08:46 Speaker 4\nOK. Anything else?\n00:08:55 Speaker 2\nMaybe I can ask her to. Maybe like what is the biggest like is it the front page news in the LA Times or something like big newspaper or New York Times or like? There's different news on the East Coast and the West Coast and different topics I used to live back east for college, and sometimes they paid for weather. It's like this long and like there's something called sleep.\n00:09:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nSure.\n00:09:32 Speaker 4\nWell, yeah, I think if you asked that for today, then every day it would change. So you'd be able to stay up on the neighbors.\n00:09:39 Speaker 2\nNews up to date, yeah.\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nThat's great. Is there anything else that you that you think you want to learn more about?\n00:09:50 Speaker 2\nUhm. Maybe I can ask her to say, like what? The weather is in my town. Or like, where my sister lives or my cousins live in, say, maybe wanna check in with. I'm gonna go with it later. I can check the weather first or something.\n00:10:11 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah, those are great topics that we can look at. Are you someone that likes to keep up on what's going on?\n00:10:21 Speaker 2\nYes, cause sometimes this phone talks to you, like mention it or just like what? But you need to be up to date.\n00:10:35 Speaker 1\nAwesome. OK. So Speaker 2, so I get you are very interested in sports such as swimming and maybe break dancing and and surfing water sports. Awesome.\n00:10:50 Speaker 2\nAnd also surfing. Yeah, I like modern sports. I like.\n00:10:58 Speaker 1\nOh, maybe for surfing. Is there anything that you're particularly interested in asking Speaker 3 about surfing?\n00:11:07 Speaker 2\nUM. Well. I was was like trying to. I think they have two athletes of different genders. I know that one of the girls is called Caroline Marks. I don't really know who the other surfer is. Maybe I'll ask her who they both are or something.\n00:11:26 Speaker 1\nOK, looks good. So who are the surf athletes?\n00:11:34 Speaker 2\nOhh, the Olympics are maybe the Olympic female surf athletes are are maybe US Olympics.\n00:11:47 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK, OK. And then the last thing we want to see and check on Speaker 2 is just how you create. Remember, last week we learned about creating a medication list. Do you still remember the command that you would use to? First create the medication list. On your Speaker 3 device.\n00:12:12 Speaker 2\nYou. Ask her for. Remember, it's like if you ask for. A list or something? Really reminder and you say I want and you add like either I type it or say like I want to add like. Like my two like like ohh my anti seizure meds and like Tylenol and and a couple of things, yeah.\n00:12:37 Speaker 1\nYeah, exactly. So and. But in order to create that list, we would just say, Speaker 3, create a medication list. So do you want to go ahead and try that?\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nIt's called medication. What should I add to it?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nHe just woke up. Keppra.\n00:12:55 Speaker 3\nWe already have a list called medication.\n00:13:01 Speaker 2\nSo I ask, can you add Keppra?\n00:13:08 Speaker 3\nI've added Keppra to your medication list. What else can I add for you?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nCan you add Lamotrigine?\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nI've added Lamotrigine to your medication list. What other items do you? Want to end them? \n00:13:19 Speaker 2\nNone.\n00:13:19 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:13:30 Speaker 2\nI did it, added my medicine.\n00:13:31 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah.\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nAnd even though there's some some other stuff they added to like like last time I added Tylenol and Pepto Bismol.\n00:13:43 Speaker 1\nThat's awesome. Yeah. So you're just able to add to it. Very good.\n00:13:47 Speaker 2\nYeah, they say making marks like print, yeah.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nAnd then, uh, Speaker 2, would you continue to add to the medication list? Uh. I mean, would you like, as you know, the weeks go on not right now, but.\n00:14:07 Speaker 2\nYeah, like, well, if maybe my my neurologist puts you on a different medicine, I would have to change them out. And maybe I go on like. Maybe I'll switch from Tylenol to Advil and switch it up.\n00:14:22 Speaker 1\nUp. Yeah, I like that.\n00:14:26 Speaker 2\nSome people, some people like, really have a big choice and it's like. They feel good to me.\n00:14:33 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yes, yes. I like that. Yeah, you're just just making it like up to date and current. Yeah.\n00:14:47 Speaker 2\nSometimes like, either my pharmacy wants to switch it up or my my neuro psych my I have a neurologist and a neuro psych. Sometimes they give me. Kind of a different list like what time do you go to my pharmacy? I have to get them both.\n00:15:07 Speaker 3\nThat's true.\n00:15:10 Speaker 1\nAnd then. OK, I think we're pretty much done. OK. Unless there's anything I'm missing.\n00:15:24 Speaker 4\nGenevieve, I don't. I'm lucky. I don't think so. I think that was. That was. Ohh, I was gonna ask so you said that your neurologist was changing up your medications, so.\n00:15:44 Speaker 2\nYeah, he was like it. Kind of like stepping down the amount of one pill and making the other one go up because it hadn't phase out one that was on early in my recovery. Now putting me more of one newer pill. I'm switching them out right now.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nSo you mentioned that you were maybe gonna change use Speaker 3 to change the reminders.\n00:16:10 Speaker 2\nYeah. Because like my dosage of this pill called Keppra is going down my pill range for this lamotrigine is going up so that he's going facing. Now one in yeah.\n00:16:24 Speaker 4\nOK. Yeah.\n00:16:27 Speaker 1\nVery nice. OK. Yeah.\n00:16:35 Speaker 2\nLet's.\n00:16:35 Speaker 1\nSee. I think I wonder if others are. Done. If should we go to the main room and just wait for the rest of the groups?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nSpeaker 2, did you used to actually surf or do you just watch it?\n00:17:08 Speaker 2\nUmm well, like before my accident. I am. I would like you know when you surf. I would get the little ones like down in Doheny or the little ways, like two or two feet like little ones. And just like, ride them to shore. It's really easy, but it's fun.\n00:17:29 Speaker 1\nThat's. Looks awesome. Ohh yeah Bolsa Chica. I've heard of that beach. It's quite famous.\n00:17:34 Speaker 2\nIt's it's, it's famous and also like Bohemia's famous too. They're both name beaches, but they're like easy to access and they're off right off PCH. Yeah.\n00:17:37 Speaker 1\nYeah. Ohh. Nice. Yeah, that's really cool. Speaker 2, do you still like to go to the beach on your off days?\n00:17:59 Speaker 2\nWell, sometimes like. My my friends, the State Guard and sometimes she I'm trying to get reintroduced. Being in the water like she in the past, she would tell me to swim with her from tower to Tower. But like I'm just kind of I'm reintroduce myself to water cause like earlier this year at UM, some seizures, so when you go back in the waves do not want to have that happen. So, like need to reintroduce myself. That's why I'm in my community pool, doing some either treading water or trying to do some little half laps. So it's all in like working my head need to make it. Work.\n00:18:44 Speaker 1\nYes, you will definitely, yeah.\n00:18:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, I want to push myself.\n00:18:48 Speaker 1\nYeah. Has Speaker 3 been pretty good at reminding you about your physical therapy appointment?\n00:18:54 Speaker 2\nYes, because I have her one of my one of my alarms is I want to have I set it for like different days of the week. My PT's are always on Wednesday, so she has alarm for. Time to go and reminder like 20 minutes before so you know your PT outfit is different than just they hang out. Alpha is like my PT. My clinician is or my PT doctor said he knew where leg and stretch you out so. To change.\n00:19:26 Speaker 1\nOhh wow yeah. That's good. And then you have enough time to, like, put your hair up and.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nBecause like well before PT, I need to have it in a bun or back cause like. One of the things well, I'm tall and also I got a lot of hair. So like sometimes my my PT, he\u2019s like you need to tie that back.\n00:19:53 Speaker 1\nSo they tell you.\n00:19:54 Speaker 2\nYeah, like UM. They're like, that's their job, physical therapy? They need to stretch me out, and if this is in the way we need to put it back.\n00:20:05 Speaker 1\nYeah, that makes sense, yeah. All right, so I think. We are going to close the breakout rooms in a second, so we'll meet each other back.\n00:20:17 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:20:32 Speaker 1\nAnd I'm excited to get to well, we're going to come back in our breakout rooms, but I'm excited for towards the end asking Speaker 3 and Speaker 2 having you ask Speaker 3 some of these questions that you were curious about. So.\n00:20:56 Speaker 4\nIs it gonna automatically? Close or do we need to leave?\n00:21:01 Speaker 1\nOh, oh, there we go.\n00:21:02 Speaker 2\nMy phone to me now.\n00:21:03 Speaker 1\nYes. All right. I'll see you back there.\n00:21:06 Speaker 2\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:21:19 Speaker 4\nHi. Hi.\n00:21:22 Speaker 2\nHi guys again.\n00:21:24 Speaker 1\nHello. OK, I will share my screen again and then. We can continue. All right, Speaker 2, do you see the screen?\n00:21:38 Speaker 2\nAs I can this is 2 commands. The person says her name start flash briefing.\n00:21:45\nMHM.\n00:21:46 Speaker 2\nThen second one stop. OK. So do you want me to ask it?\n00:21:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, yes. Yeah. Go ahead. Actually, I can play it on a slideshow. So you can do that one first and then Yep.\n00:22:01 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Start flash briefing.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:22:21 Speaker 2\nWright brothers.\n00:22:27 Speaker 3\nFrom Post reports.\n00:22:31 Speaker 3\nAs you've probably heard us talk about on the show, The Washington Post has a big team covering the Paris Olympics. They're following all the highlights and what's happening behind the scenes.\n00:22:43 Speaker 2\nThey just switched me over to like, like no news about the Paris Olympics. Going on right now.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nOhh very cool. Yeah, so it didn't. It didn't keep on going and going.\n00:22:55 Speaker 2\nNo, I just like just switching out right away, yeah.\n00:22:57 Speaker 1\nWith this thought. Oh, wow. OK, so you don't have to say stop because.\n00:23:02 Speaker 2\nNo, it's they kept on going. But I'm saying as long.\n00:23:08 Speaker 1\nOhh so did you stop it?\n00:23:09 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, hit the little stop button because it said it said 27 minutes. I'm not gonna wait.\n00:23:17 Speaker 1\nWow. OK, very good, very good. OK, let's go on to the next one then. OK, so this one is kind of like knowing what's going on in your own personal calendar. So, Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try this one?\n00:23:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what's on my calendar?\n00:23:46 Speaker 3\nThere's nothing scheduled for the next 30 days.\n00:23:51 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:23:52 Speaker 2\nAnd I haven't had to restart it, so it's like it says yes. Yeah, you need to re put them in here after, after, right after our session to update it for next week.\n00:24:07 Speaker 1\nSo if there's nothing on your calendar, do you want to try making an event for something?\n00:24:12 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Speaker 3, can you make an event for tomorrow morning at 11:00 AM?\n00:24:26 Speaker 3\nOK. And what's the name of the event?\n00:24:29 Speaker 2\nSaint Jude's therapy network.\n00:24:32 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:24:39 Speaker 2\nShe just added something to my calendar.\n00:24:41 Speaker 1\nNice success. Are there any? Are there any other events that that you want to add to Speaker 3?\n00:24:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, it's.\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:25:06 Speaker 3\nAnd one way that I've been keeping up on. All of it is. By listening to the posts pop up.\n00:25:12 Speaker 2\nThe poses kept on going. Maybe we can add some more events to my calendar.\n00:25:33 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, let's try one more.\n00:25:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, can I have? Can I schedule an event for Monday morning? Hey.\n00:25:43 Speaker 3\nMonday and time.\n00:25:45 Speaker 2\nMonday morning at 11:00 AM. Doctor.\n00:25:48 Speaker 3\nAnd the name of the event.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nDoctor Bellucci meeting.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nOK, I've added that.\n00:25:57 Speaker 2\nYeah. So it's on here.\n00:25:59 Speaker 1\nYay. OK, now Speaker 2, can you ask what's on my calendar? And let's see if Speaker 3. OK, fine.\n00:26:09 Speaker 2\nOK.

On Monday, August 12th, at 11:00 AM, there's doctor Bellucci.\n00:26:31 Speaker 1\nNice six of this.\n00:26:32 Speaker 2\nBut it's like, you know, coming out like those are my most current appointments here.\n00:26:39 Speaker 1\nExactly. Yeah, I'm glad. OK. She is responding. Yes, very up to date. Awesome. OK, Genevieve, go ahead and and kind of take over.\n00:26:43 Speaker 2\nUp to date right now.\n00:26:56 Speaker 4\nSure. Umm. So let's look at some uh news. So can you read the command?\n00:27:03 Speaker 2\nOK, it says her name. Who is running for president? Who was running for president to ask her?\n00:27:14 Speaker 4\nYeah. So you can go ahead and ask her this.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'll do this training, OK. Speaker 3, who is running for president.\n00:27:26 Speaker 3\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior. Jill Stein, Cornell West and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:27:56 Speaker 2\nThat was kind of up to date.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nI do not know that did.\n00:27:57 Speaker 4\nYeah. I didn't even know that. Did you know about Speaker 2?\n00:28:02 Speaker 1\nVery cool.\n00:28:06 Speaker 2\nWell, like I heard about like the top two, like Kamala and Trump. And then like, I learned about. RFK Junior and then. They're only those three, but there's some other ones there's learn about right now.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nCast this moment hosted by my colleague Eva Wall.\n00:28:25 Speaker 4\nThat's great.\n00:28:31 Speaker 1\nAlright, OK, next is. MHM.\n00:28:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Do you want me to ask her?\n00:28:43 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah, let's go ahead. So you can ask Speaker 3 about, yeah, just like current events.\n00:28:51 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. When is the election?\n00:28:57 Speaker 3\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:29:14 Speaker 2\nIt's OK. It's like well, it's November 5th. That's in like three months.\n00:29:24 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.\n00:29:27 Speaker 2\nBut like, you know, usually like the two months before, it's like everywhere. And the news is like this, this.\n00:29:36 Speaker 4\nDo you? Do you have any? Like follow up questions that would be related to the election?\n00:29:45 Speaker 3\nOn today's episode of the Sports moments, David.\n00:29:49 Speaker 2\nI would just probably ask. Maybe the local election questions like in California, like who's gonna be the governor or something like that.\n00:30:00 Speaker 4\nOK, you want to try asking her that?\n00:30:07 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3. Who is running for Governor of California?\n00:30:15 Speaker 3\nThe candidates in the 2022 California election for governor were Gavin Newsom and Brian Dahl.\n00:30:24 Speaker 2\nOhh, there's two guys running for it, you know. They knew some of this other guy.\n00:30:31 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:30:33 Speaker 2\nSome guy called Brian Brian Dahl learned about it today.\n00:30:41 Speaker 4\nDo you know anything about them? Either of them?\n00:30:45 Speaker 2\nWell, like Gavin Newsom was our previous governor, he's like going to be running again, and this this other guy and put him in the Internet too, happens.\n00:30:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:30:57 Speaker 4\nSo you could put it in the Internet, or you could even ask. More questions maybe if you're not sure what you're going to vote.\n00:31:06 Speaker 3\nDan Zac, who was covering the.\n00:31:09 Speaker 2\nI could just ask her and. That's why that guy.\n00:31:16 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:31:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Should we go on to the next one? That was great.\n00:31:29 Speaker 1\nAlright, let's ask this, OK.\n00:31:37 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is interesting now?\n00:31:46 Speaker 3\nWelcome to what's interesting now. Each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Irvine from Los Angeles Times.\n00:32:03 Speaker 3\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig in Tahiti resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his surfing correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:32:21 Speaker 3\nFrom Los Angeles.\n00:32:22 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:32:23 Speaker 3\nThe British rock icon rock.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nThey're just doing on different news articles about.\n00:32:29 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you can tell Speaker 3 to stop anytime. Or. Yeah. Yeah, I think you just click.\n00:32:36 Speaker 2\nAre you just hit the little pause? Yeah, they're just right now. They were just going to, you know, the old Rod Stewart was like.\n00:32:38 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:32:45 Speaker 2\nI'm not old for that. Yeah. Because it says that Rod Stewart is.\n00:32:57 Speaker 3\nA cultural event.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nNow his biggest relevancy is his illness. Learned about that today.\n00:33:10 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2, there is another command that I can. Sorry, excuse me. There's another command that I can kind of. Teach you it's uh, I think it's like Speaker 3, what's the story? And do you want to try that? I don't know if it'll give you if that also is a skill that might give you some stories or I don't know how it's going to respond, but do you want? To try that one.\n00:33:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Speaker 3, what is the story?\n00:33:48 Speaker 3\nA narrative story or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional or fictional.\n00:34:00 Speaker 1\nOK, sorry, I think I think.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nYeah, but. A different word.\n00:34:07 Speaker 1\nYeah, when I. Speaker 3 sometimes prompts can prompt you, so if she's talking about a certain news like headline, yeah, you can ask. What's the story? And then she'll kind of elaborate more on it.\n00:34:23 Speaker 2\nMore detail, OK.\n00:34:24 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah. So I think that's when it will be appropriate to use that one. Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right, let's go on to. The next one, no. All right. Sorry. Go ahead. Send a beep. OK.\n00:34:43 Speaker 4\nOK. So yeah, we can kind of see what it's like in your area or even like how we did in the other you can, you know, ask this question or ask for different areas. But why don't we start by trying this command?\n00:35:01 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK, I'm asking. Speaker 3. What's the traffic like?\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:35:18 Speaker 2\nWell, she wants my work address.\n00:35:20 Speaker 3\nOK, currently, traffic on your commute looks good. The fastest route takes about one minute via Sierra Cello Rd.\n00:35:48 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah my work and where I am now is the same place. It's it's one minute comes.\n00:36:00 Speaker 4\nAnother thing that you could ask like when I used to drive in commute, I would drive on the 5 freeway, would even ask what's the traffic like on the 5 freeway or another freeway that you take a lot.\n00:36:16 Speaker 2\nAlright so. I'm gonna ask her, OK? Speaker 3, what is the traffic on the 405 freeway right now?\n00:36:28 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:33 Speaker 2\nOK, Speaker 3. What's the traffic like on the 405 freeway?\n00:36:41 Speaker 3\nHmm, sorry I couldn't help try asking again.\n00:36:46 Speaker 4\nI don't think she likes that command.\n00:36:48 Speaker 2\nNo, but like I live closer to the 405 than the five, but.\n00:36:54 Speaker 4\nYeah, maybe we could, I can look and see if I can figure out how. To reword it to ask about that, maybe next time.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, probably next time.\n00:37:07 Speaker 4\nLet's see. OK. All right, so this one, you can kind of look into some exercises, so let's try asking about this exercise.\n00:37:23 Speaker 2\nAlright, OK. Speaker 3. What are exercises for lower back pain?\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHere's something I found on reference.com partial crunches. Hamstring stretches, walls sits and bridging are four exercises that can improve lower back pain dot regular weight lifting and aerobic exercise such as walking, biking or running are also helpful. But people should stop these exercises if they cause any pain. For people who experience.\n00:38:06 Speaker 2\nShe listed, she listed it off. A good list of things like, you know, your lower back is like a big. Part of it, yeah, overall health. So you were standing up straight is always good.\n00:38:20 Speaker 4\nYeah. And you could even try this with, you know, other pain that you get too. Like, if you get pain in you know your neck or something like that. You could you could. Try that as well.\n00:38:31 Speaker 2\nAsk her for that. Yeah, because, like sometimes. Like my like the size of my neck scent is. My PT my PT says you're stiff. You stretch it out.\n00:38:46 Speaker 4\nYeah. All right, let's try one more.\n00:38:54 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:38:58 Speaker 4\nOK, so why don't you go ahead and ask this one?\n00:39:07 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:39:14 Speaker 3\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 3 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:39:32 Speaker 2\nWell, yeah, you know this town, Olympia, maybe it's a real place.\n00:39:40 Speaker 1\nIt probably is, yeah.\n00:39:42 Speaker 2\nOver there.\n00:39:45 Speaker 1\nUh, this is actually a good segway. Speaker 2, do you want to ask a couple questions that you were actually genuinely curious about? Like the questions you were telling us earlier?\n00:39:58 Speaker 2\nRight.\n00:39:59 Speaker 1\nSo I yeah, I think they were. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sure you have them. It was about break dancing teams or like the other. The Surf, surf, athletes, anything that comes to mind.\n00:40:14 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:40:16 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 3. Who are the US Olympic female surfers?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nFrom surfacefootprint.com. The Olympic medal favorites in the male surfing event are John John Florence and Kolohe Andino, and the Olympic medal favorites in the female surfing event are Carissa Moon and Caroline Marks from the USA.\n00:40:46 Speaker 2\nWell, they gave me an overall answer, but the girls were on there like Caroline and this other girl. So even though the list of the boys too is like I know them.\n00:40:59 Speaker 4\nNow that's great.\n00:41:04 Speaker 1\nVery good. \n00:41:07 Speaker 2\nYeah. It's good for me.  It's like I hear them again, like if I'm in my room at night. She says something though. Need to be up to date.\n00:41:17 Speaker 1\nPlease have fun. Alright, so we are. Yeah, we're going to go back to the main room, but great job today. Speaker 2. I think I learned a lot.\n00:41:24 Speaker 2\nWe are all learning.\n00:41:29 Speaker 1\nThanks for your questions. Yeah.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.? \nResponse: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** R.T.  \n**Date:** 08-08-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient expresses a desire to utilize their Alexa device (Speaker 3) for accessing news and scheduling reminders.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nR.T. is a [age not specified] year-old [gender not specified] who is currently using an Alexa device to assist with scheduling and accessing information.

S:  RT  arrived  to  the  session  on  time,  motivated  and  ready  to  participate  in  the  training.  At  the  start of the user needs assessment, pt identified her goal was to learn how to ask Alexa information-seeking questions related to the Olympics and 2024 presidential election. During the recap of last week\u2019s lesson, pt executed voice command in 1/1 trials to add to her medication list. She reported that she will continue to add to the list depending on any changes prescribed by both her psychiatrist and neuropsychologist.   O   3.  User  Needs:  Pt  identified  two  specific  topics  of  information  she  listens  to  the  news  for. Pt identified two topics she is currently interested in discussing or learning more about. Pt identified 9/10 scenarios to complete the sentence: \u201cI want to ask/know more about.\u201d  4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  utilized  voice  commands  to  inquire  about  information  regarding  the  weather, events on her calendar, and current news on the Alexa device in 15/17 trials in a 1:1 setting with the clinician given minimal verbal cues.   A:   3.  User  Needs:  Pt  appropriately  responded  to  all  user  needs  assessment  interview  questions. During user needs assessment, pt was thoughtful in her responses and most inquisitive about athletes competing in the 2024 Olympic games, particularly in the sports of breakdancing, swimming, and surfing. Furthermore, pt expressed interest in current news across various geographic locations.   4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  met  her  goal  of  using  concise  voice  commands  in  80%  of  trials  to  seek information regarding news and facts on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues. Pt demonstrated intelligible speech when verbalizing Alexa voice commands and executed 15 commands successfully and independently given an initial model. One command, \u201cwhat is the traffic like on the 405 freeway\u201d required repetition, however, was not specific enough in context for Alexa to understand and execute.

Here are the key areas of divergence:\n\n1. **Subjective Content**: The target note focuses on the patient's goals related to specific information-seeking questions about the Olympics and the 2024 presidential election, while the generated note discusses the patient's interest in entertainment and leisure activities, such as sports and video games. This represents a fundamental difference in the focus of the session.\n\n2. **Goals and Objectives**: The target note includes specific measurable goals (e.g., using concise voice commands with 80% accuracy) and details about the patient's performance in trials, which are absent in the generated note. The generated note lacks quantifiable outcomes and specific goals related to the use of the Alexa device.\n\n3. **Assessment Details**: The target note provides a detailed assessment of the patient's engagement with specific topics and their performance in using voice commands, while the generated note discusses broader issues related to technology use and leisure activities without specific performance metrics.\n\n4. **Plan Specificity**: The plan in the target note includes specific homework assignments and metacognitive strategies, while the generated note outlines general training and education without specific tasks or strategies for the patient to work on.\n\n5. **Terminology and Structure**: The generated note uses different terminology and structure, such as \"Chief Complaint\" and \"History of Present Illness,\" which are not present in the target note. The target note follows a more structured format with clear sections for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan.\n\nOverall, while both notes address the use of technology and patient engagement, the differences in focus, specificity, and structure contribute to a higher loss score.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

He  was  prompted  by  mom throughout the session when Alexa didn't pick up command.M.A. was cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. His mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.   Objective  (O):    Review  of  week  2  content  related  to  entertainment  was  completed  first.  M.A.  was  asked  to  play any music or video of his choice using his Echo device.  Practiced  commands:  \u201cAlexa,  play  a  video  from  January  3rd.\u201d  accurately  in  1/1  attempts.   -  His  mother  mentioned  syncing  his  Apple  music  account  to  the  Amazon  Echo  Device/Alexa account which made it possible for Alexa to access the content from his phone and in turn, was able to play a video from a specific date.  -  He  also  practiced  a  command  to  stop  the  video  or  music  (\u201cAlexa,  Stop\u201d)   that  was  playing in 1 out of 2 attempts needing mod cueing to unmute the device before executing this command.  His  mother  mentioned  that  MA  has  been  able  to  use  Alexa  for  playing  Bon  Jovi  songs  that  he likes to listen. His mother asked questions related to syncing a radio station to his Echo device and similarly was also interested in using the BARD library for blind app on his Echo device to improve his accessibility to the entertainment/books without assistance from his caregivers.   User  Needs  Assessment:   Interview  style  Q  and  A  completed  to  learn  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs  related  to  self  care  and medical needs.  -  MA  needs  assistance  with  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  such  as  washing  hair,  brushing teeth, trimming nails and eating breakfast -  He  depends  entirely  on  his  parents  for  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  except  for  sometimes setting reminders for various needs  Scenarios  for  using  Alexa  for  self-care  and  medical  needs:   Dosage  of  medication,  reminder  to  refill/reorder  medication,  reminders  to  have  breakfast  on  certain time, brushing teeth at a certain time, reading the medication list for morning routine/evening, checking off the medications that have been taken for that particular day.  MA  was  introduced  to  tactically  feel  the  button  for  mute  and  unmute  on  top  of  the  Echo  device for him to be able to improve his ability to use the device more independently.   Command  training/practice:   MA  practiced  17  commands  related  to  self-care  and  medical  needs.  He  executed  verbal  commands for creating a medication list, adding a medication (tylenol) to the created list, read the medication list back  (\u201cAlexa, read me my medication list\u201d), reminder for taking a specific medication (depocope) at a given time (\u201cAlexa, remind me to take decocope tomorrow at 7.30 am\u201d), reminder for doing laundry, steps on how to do the laundry in 1/1 attempts  using  the  verbal  prompts  and  modeling  provided  by  the  clinician  and  his  mother  both. He was also able to ask questions including where he could find tylenol, how to get stains out clothes, how to use a fabric softener, how to treat a migraine, what to take for stomach ache, and asking on how to find a physical therapist.    Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:   With  the  Q  and  A  style  interview  questions,  the  participant  continues  to  need  mod  to  max  cueing and scaffolding from his mother and clinicians to participate and elaborate on his subjective responses. For self care and medical needs, the participant is caregiver dependent and the use of Alexa would assist the participant in being independent with reminders for medications, asking questions regarding tasks related to this topic  The  participant  continued  to  demonstrate  progress  with  his  ability  to  execute  the  commands  this week given min to mod verbal prompting and cueing to be a louder and over articulate to ensure the ASR would recognize the command Given  MA  that  is  blind,  the  command  related  to  steps  or  instructions  to  do  laundry  was  the  one that was the most challenging. The Echo Show presented the written steps or instructions to complete laundry on the screen; however it wouldn\u2019t provide verbal output for the same. This required the clinician and his mother to prompt MA to execute different reworded commands to determine that the device was reading one step at a time to complete this task (laundry). The command that produced the desired results was \u201cAlexa, read me the instructions to do laundry one step at a time\u201d. Although, this command still yielded verbal output of all the steps at once instead of proving one step at a time. With the command \u201cwhat do I take for stomach pain?\u201d, the command was not processed and needed to be reworded to \u201cstomach ache\u201d   Plan  (P):   Participant  encouraged  to  talk  slower  and  over  articulate  with  complex  words  like  names  of  the medications etc to improve the ASR of the system. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:  Medications  (dosage,  reminders,  creating  medication  lists-adding,  deleting,  reading to the medication list)  Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  what  dosage  of  tylenol  can  I  take  at  once\u201d   Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  remind  me  to  refill  my  prescription  for  depakote\u201d  *alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time.

MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes\u201d   \u201cAlexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  can  you  repeat?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes\u201d  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  check  off  gum\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese\u201d   \u201cRead  me  option  one\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  option  two\u201d  \u201cAlexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk\u201d  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what\u2019s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe\u201d  \u201cHey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?\u201d  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?\u201d   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance \u201cAlexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese\u201d led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command \u201c Alexa, read me option one\u201d led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA\u2019s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn\u2019t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  clear  my  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers\u201d   \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities.

Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET: Subjective  (S):   M.A.  logged  onto  his  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?\u201d  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  \u201cTrazadone\u201d  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week\u2019s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. \u201cIs there a fact you would like to know?\u201d) M.A. practice the following commands: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?\u201d  -  \u201c Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cFor  the  gym\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?\u201d  -  \u201cAlexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?\u201d   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying \u201csuch as___\u201d to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.\u2019s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as \u201cWho do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?\u201d  and  \u201cIs  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?\u201d.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  news  and  facts.  Please  practice  these  five commands with your Alexa. Record each command you practice and then submit it to researchers  Task  1:  Telling  Joke  1.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  a  joke\u201d   Task  2:  Asking  for  the  Weather  2.  \u201cAlexa,  what\u2019s  the  weather?\u201d   Task  3:  Asking  for  News  3.  \u201cAlexa,  play  flash  briefing\u201d   Task  4:  Searching  for  Information  4.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  where  I  can  buy  cold  medicine\u201d  5.  \u201cAlexa,  where  is  the  nearest  gas  station?\u201d  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

His mother elaborated on M.A\u2019s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.   Objective  (O):    Review  of  week  2  content  related  to  entertainment  was  completed  first.  M.A.  was  asked  to  play any music or video of his choice using his Echo device.  Practiced  commands:  \u201cAlexa,  play  a  video  from  January  3rd.\u201d  accurately  in  1/1  attempts.   -  His  mother  mentioned  syncing  his  Apple  music  account  to  the  Amazon  Echo  Device/Alexa account which made it possible for Alexa to access the content from his phone and in turn, was able to play a video from a specific date.  -  He  also  practiced  a  command  to  stop  the  video  or  music  (\u201cAlexa,  Stop\u201d)   that  was  playing in 1 out of 2 attempts needing mod cueing to unmute the device before executing this command.  His  mother  mentioned  that  MA  has  been  able  to  use  Alexa  for  playing  Bon  Jovi  songs  that  he likes to listen. His mother asked questions related to syncing a radio station to his Echo device and similarly was also interested in using the BARD library for blind app on his Echo device to improve his accessibility to the entertainment/books without assistance from his caregivers.   User  Needs  Assessment:   Interview  style  Q  and  A  completed  to  learn  about  the  participant\u2019s  needs  related  to  self  care  and medical needs.  -  MA  needs  assistance  with  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  such  as  washing  hair,  brushing teeth, trimming nails and eating breakfast -  He  depends  entirely  on  his  parents  for  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  except  for  sometimes setting reminders for various needs  Scenarios  for  using  Alexa  for  self-care  and  medical  needs:   Dosage  of  medication,  reminder  to  refill/reorder  medication,  reminders  to  have  breakfast  on  certain time, brushing teeth at a certain time, reading the medication list for morning routine/evening, checking off the medications that have been taken for that particular day.  MA  was  introduced  to  tactically  feel  the  button  for  mute  and  unmute  on  top  of  the  Echo  device for him to be able to improve his ability to use the device more independently.   Command  training/practice:   MA  practiced  17  commands  related  to  self-care  and  medical  needs.  He  executed  verbal  commands for creating a medication list, adding a medication (tylenol) to the created list, read the medication list back  (\u201cAlexa, read me my medication list\u201d), reminder for taking a specific medication (depocope) at a given time (\u201cAlexa, remind me to take decocope tomorrow at 7.30 am\u201d), reminder for doing laundry, steps on how to do the laundry in 1/1 attempts  using  the  verbal  prompts  and  modeling  provided  by  the  clinician  and  his  mother  both. He was also able to ask questions including where he could find tylenol, how to get stains out clothes, how to use a fabric softener, how to treat a migraine, what to take for stomach ache, and asking on how to find a physical therapist.    Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:   With  the  Q  and  A  style  interview  questions,  the  participant  continues  to  need  mod  to  max  cueing and scaffolding from his mother and clinicians to participate and elaborate on his subjective responses. For self care and medical needs, the participant is caregiver dependent and the use of Alexa would assist the participant in being independent with reminders for medications, asking questions regarding tasks related to this topic  The  participant  continued  to  demonstrate  progress  with  his  ability  to  execute  the  commands  this week given min to mod verbal prompting and cueing to be a louder and over articulate to ensure the ASR would recognize the command Given  MA  that  is  blind,  the  command  related  to  steps  or  instructions  to  do  laundry  was  the  one that was the most challenging. The Echo Show presented the written steps or instructions to complete laundry on the screen; however it wouldn\u2019t provide verbal output for the same. This required the clinician and his mother to prompt MA to execute different reworded commands to determine that the device was reading one step at a time to complete this task (laundry). The command that produced the desired results was \u201cAlexa, read me the instructions to do laundry one step at a time\u201d. Although, this command still yielded verbal output of all the steps at once instead of proving one step at a time. With the command \u201cwhat do I take for stomach pain?\u201d, the command was not processed and needed to be reworded to \u201cstomach ache\u201d   Plan  (P):   Participant  encouraged  to  talk  slower  and  over  articulate  with  complex  words  like  names  of  the medications etc to improve the ASR of the system. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:  Medications  (dosage,  reminders,  creating  medication  lists-adding,  deleting,  reading to the medication list)  Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  what  dosage  of  tylenol  can  I  take  at  once\u201d   Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  remind  me  to  refill  my  prescription  for  depakote\u201d  *alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time.    Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  create  a  medication  list   Command  4:  Alexa,  Add  \u201cneosporin  to  my  medication  list  Command  5:  Alexa,  Delete  \u201cneosporin\u201d  from  my  medication  list   Command  6:  Alexa,  Read  me  my  medication  list   Task  2:  Laundry    Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  instructions  on  how  to  do  laundry  one  step  at  a  time   Command  2:  Alexa,  remind  me  to  do  laundry.  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions   Command  3:  Alexa,  what  do  I  use  to  get  stains  out  of  my  clothes   Task  3:  Finding  OTC/home  remedies  to  remediate  minor  health  problems    Command  1:  Alexa,  how  to  I  treat  migraine   Task  4:  Finding  doctors/health  care  professionals  nearby   Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  physical  therapy  doctor  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.A.  \n**Date:** 07-25-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Setting:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M.A. is participating in a session to assess the use of technology for reminders and entertainment.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old male with visual impairment.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\n\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 2\n1st is you're gonna show me how you could set up and set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4?\n00:00:09 Speaker 1\nOK.

Yeah.\n00:03:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:03:36 Speaker 1\nNot really, and by me drawing it, he could. He could put two post 2 together. Listen.\n00:03:43 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 3, how about anything else that you do like apart from because of video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nThere's one get that one game that we found. What? Is it called? The book. No, the there's an auditory game. Oh yeah, this has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called.\n00:04:11 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:04:13 Speaker 1\nBut it's got a shadow of the.\n00:04:16 Speaker 2\nRight.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:04:18 Speaker 1\nAnd so I helped get Speaker 3 set up on it on the Xbox.\n00:04:21 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAnd then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:29 Speaker 2\nAll right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:34 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:04:36 Speaker 3\nAlright. Right.\n00:04:41 Speaker 2\nAll right. All right, Speaker 3, that's great. Or any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to.\n00:04:51 Speaker 3\nMusic.\n00:04:52 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. All right.\n00:05:03 Speaker 4\nMe.\n00:05:07 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To currently use for for these uh, entertainment activities. So definitely there's TV.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:05:28 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:34 Speaker 3\nUh-huh.\n00:05:36 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What? Else, do you use do you use? Your phones or computer?\n00:05:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, I do.\n00:05:45 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:05:49 Speaker 1\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad? Either or for. All those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're gonna come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know, the things that you can say to Speaker 4 so that it could play it for you. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what? Would the first one be here?\n00:06:55 Speaker 1\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 3 on TV. How would you go about doing that?\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nClick the channel.\n00:07:05 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:05 Speaker 3\nWatch it. Hey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel? Is Isaac.\n00:07:20 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:21 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that correct?\n00:07:22 Speaker 1\nShe just.\n00:07:24 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:28 Speaker 4\nBecause it's more related to that.\n00:07:31 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nAnd.\n00:07:37 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:07:49 Speaker 4\nSomething say it again.\n00:07:52 Speaker 2\nEyes help you with law.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nShould I you, Sir?\n00:07:54 Speaker 2\nYeah. Yeah, I would.\n00:08:00 Speaker 1\nMuted.\n00:08:01 Speaker 2\nOn, alright, what else? What? What other scenario can you think of Speaker 3? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? You broke. Would you wanna listen? To like highlights of a game from, like from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK. OK or what? Kind of music, would you? Would you say you want to?\n00:08:36 Speaker 3\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:08:40 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright. I listen to. Music. From particular.\n00:08:56 Speaker 3\nArtists.\n00:08:57 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. What else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:09:17 Speaker 2\nOK, alright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:26 Speaker 3\nLove yourself.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nAuditory. Stimuli and feedback. Oh.\n00:09:33 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:09:35 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYou used to. A lot of.\n00:09:42 Speaker 2\nAny particular kind of like maybe you know how some of those games have? Like, they're related to words or some are, you know, it's like jeopardy or some are. Testing games, things like that. Like is there. Is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:09:59 Speaker 3\nOh.\n00:10:01 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. All right. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:13 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:10:15 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:15 Speaker 1\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, I did. Yeah.\n00:10:25 Speaker 1\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say, like uh, you know, high hey like like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play it.\n00:10:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Is that something Speaker 3, did you used to watch Netflix a lot?\n00:10:53 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. What?\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nSo I can put out my account on there for him, is that correct?\n00:11:01 Speaker 2\nYeah you can. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think? Of or. That's about it.\n00:11:14 Speaker 3\nThat's about it.\n00:11:16 Speaker 2\nHi, alright. Speaker 3, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nThanks.\n00:11:28 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK.\n00:11:30 Speaker 2\nAlright, so we're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands as a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:11:55 Speaker 1\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you are you thinking of like? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely different?\n00:12:27 Speaker 2\nSo Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills, which are games. And which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that with your voice. So definitely that and then.\n00:12:47 Speaker 1\nWhere might I find a? List of. Of those types of games.\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nSo if you would like just go, if you go on Amazon app like the UM, Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games and it it it has, like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like they have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal. OK. Things like that, which are very, very familiar. Of course that those are part of the TV. So but there are different other things as well, so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:31 Speaker 1\nAnd then I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated. OK.\n00:13:35 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:13:38 Speaker 1\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:13:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something, UM, interest that, that would entrust him, I will send it to you.\n00:14:01 Speaker 1\nAs well, uh, that would be.\n00:14:02 Speaker 2\nAwesome. We'll share with him.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that. Or in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision, like luminosity or cognitive, like the names are. I'm kind of escaping them but.\n00:14:16 Speaker 6\nBecause.\n00:14:23 Speaker 1\nThe the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad. IPad so. It just it isn't accessible so.\n00:14:45 Speaker 2\nIt does, yeah, yeah. No, but definitely there are I guess, which require even though there is visualized visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know? So. So yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that, you know. He he cannot play, so that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions, you know, so that it it. Kind of stay sharp, right? Like, that's that's something we all need to do. But definitely that will. That'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time. Speaker 3, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:28 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 3, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it.\n00:15:35 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:15:35 Speaker 1\nRight. I don't think she heard you.\n00:15:44 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:15:49 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:15:55 Speaker 3\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:15:58 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:00 Speaker 3\n9:30.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 9:37.\n00:16:06 Speaker 3\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:08 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go? For to go to a beach. Ohh, that's amazing. OK alright.\n00:16:15 Speaker 1\nI said, where are we going tomorrow? It's to give me an idea for what? To set it for.\n00:16:21 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM it will it will set it to the closest like so since it's evening already it's going to set it. To. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know? Yeah, it will just set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:16:49 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:16:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right.\n00:16:54 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:16:57 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room. Hey, all right. Hey, Speaker 3. OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. All right, Speaker 3. So this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next or would you? To do a joke.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:43 Speaker 3\nA joke.\n00:17:44 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some. Use it. Some music all right. All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me like a Star Trek joke. Speaker 4, tell me a Doctor Who joke. Anything that you like can can can be a joke like that so. Sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:18:39 Speaker 3\nTry a joke.\n00:18:41 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:18:47 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:18:51 Speaker 4\nHere's a despicable new joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:05 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:07 Speaker 4\nGuidance.\n00:19:16 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 3. OK.\n00:19:17 Speaker 5\n1st.\n00:19:19 Speaker 3\nYou're the most.\n00:19:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:19:56 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:01 Speaker 1\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:04 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 3, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom which sort of means that. It heard your voice or it. It's the wake up word for it. So uh, it. It almost means that it the UM the device is. Listening so. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get it goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are a lot of questions even online when you just like. Kind of search that what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. So.\n00:21:21 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n00:21:24 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 3.\n00:21:33 Speaker 1\nMake a clean one.\n00:21:35 Speaker 3\nNipsey hussle.\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nIt's not that clean. It's not. You can do anything, Speaker 3. Whatever you want. Just.\n00:21:50 Speaker 3\nCan I get a clean song?\n00:21:54 Speaker 1\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:21:55 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can I get cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:00 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with a cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:08 Speaker 1\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:10 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:21 Speaker 1\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey song.\n00:22:22 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh yeah.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nAnd lexicon song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. An app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something. Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like yeah, even.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nOK. What's a common song living on a prayer?\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nLiving on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:11 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:15 Speaker 2\nOh, hey. So Speaker 3, I guess.\n00:23:20 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month contained canceled. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. OK. Should I sign you up and play?\n00:23:27 Speaker 4\nLiving on a prayer.\n00:23:27 Speaker 1\nTo say not right now.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 3, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:23:51 Speaker 3\nSweet Caroline.\n00:23:54 Speaker 1\nTell.\n00:23:55 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:23:59 Speaker 1\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:02 Speaker 4\nNurses station, based on student Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:07 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:10 Speaker 1\nThere you go.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nYeah, alright. Is it playing?\n00:24:17 Speaker 1\nIt is.\n00:24:18 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. Alright. Do you want to? Do the volume up or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:33 Speaker 3\nThat we have.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:24:40 Speaker 3\nYeah, like I said, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:24:47 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward the stream.\n00:24:50 Speaker 1\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:24:54 Speaker 4\nReally. Yeah.\n00:24:56 Speaker 2\nThat's so odd.\n00:24:58 Speaker 3\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:00 Speaker 1\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know.\n00:25:05 Speaker 2\nHuh.\n00:25:09 Speaker 1\nWhy don't you say volume? Speaker 3.\n00:25:12 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt did the opposite, yeah. Give it how many times I believe.\n00:25:28 Speaker 3\nVolume up by 3.\n00:25:31 Speaker 4\nAnd no sound. If I.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 3. Down two times.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 4, volume down to times.\n00:25:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, it did. There you go.\n00:25:54 Speaker 2\nPerfect. How about we try? The two play it from the beginning.\n00:26:05 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:14 Speaker 1\nTry again.\n00:26:15 Speaker 3\nHey, Alex, can you play this song from the beginning? So. Hey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:29 Speaker 4\nHe's starting his song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:26:35 Speaker 2\nThere was a lot of restrictions here I. Guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and. Go back, play from the beginning. All of that also, we're definitely able to do all of that so. Yeah.\n00:27:05 Speaker 1\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 3 has Apple music. I wonder. Yeah. That when I should be able to hook the Apple music. To.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nIt yeah, you should be able to. OK. Definitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. OK. Alright. And maybe if you had like a. Made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well. You know. So our previous songs go back.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 3 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:08 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line, one step blue line is on and then you start speaking it definitely picks up the command better. Right. I think if it's in if if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it it doesn't usually it. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 3 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just wanna say, like, maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works. Yeah. Where there's, like, a just a very small pause. It doesn't even have to be very long because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you, you're not going to say anything. Next. So. Yeah, but more or less, you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying, uh, playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you. Yeah, but OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Alright, so even even though Speaker 3 you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But. It just has to be just Speaker 4. Uh. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Uh. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has, yeah.\n00:30:45 Speaker 1\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 3 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will. Well, and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give a visual description of what's going on in the background of the movie. So it'll describe the scenes and some TV's do that, ours doesn't. But some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature. So I dream if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's I it's something description, audio description or something like that.\n00:31:20 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:31:35 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nJust.\n00:31:48 Speaker 2\nSo.\n00:31:48 Speaker 1\nDo you understand? I'm trying. I'm. I'm.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Yeah, it's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the sure that's going on on the screen, so. Thanks.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nFor what you have on the screen right now, it would say something like blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background. And. With the following word.\n00:32:18 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. Uh, if if it has the kind of. Captioning or yeah.\n00:32:33 Speaker 5\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:32:35 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about.\n00:32:39 Speaker 5\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 3, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example if you. Decide to like look up pictures. From like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own closed captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us in that respect.\n00:33:32 Speaker 1\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nStarting to. OK. OK. Right. Right. Yeah, like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh, But yeah, I mean, maybe if they're not providing yet, but hopefully in the future, very soon, even Alex, I should start providing that. Hopefully that that will help a lot. Yeah.\n00:34:23 Speaker 1\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:26 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:29 Speaker 3\nM.\n00:34:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. All right. So I guess that's about it. Let me stop sharing. Alright. Is there anything else, Speaker 3 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or? Anything related? To today's. Question.\n00:34:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:34:59 Speaker 2\nOr in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nI don't think yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 3's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch it back to our house. So it worked out because Speaker 3 was living in Kansas. Prior to, you know.\n00:35:25 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, sure. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help you. With any of those.\n00:35:45 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:35:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 3, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:01 Speaker 1\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 3. There you go.\n00:36:03 Speaker 2\nAlright, perfect. There you go. All right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main main main room or?\n00:36:21 Speaker 1\nLet.\n00:36:21 Speaker 2\nWhat should we do?\n00:36:21 Speaker 1\nMe.\n00:36:25 Speaker 5\nIt looks.\n00:36:25 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave and go to the main room.\n00:36:28 Speaker 5\nI don't know. Yeah, we I guess we could go cause I or. I don't know if people left or. People went back.\n00:36:37 Speaker 2\nI have no clue.\n00:36:43 Speaker 5\nGenex group is back. In the news.\n00:36:45 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the meeting room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah. Yeah. No, thank.\n00:36:54 Speaker 1\nAll right.\n00:36:55 Speaker 5\nYou so much for the recommendation.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nThank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:01 Speaker 1\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, leave the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- 00:37:20 Speaker 7\nHey. Speaker 3, we have friends who are still working on their things. Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more, cause Speaker 4 is too. Quick for him. So we did have that. Speaker 6, you're very up to speed with your old Speaker 8 and Speaker 3. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So if you're done, we just want to say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Speaker 6.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nBye.\n00:37:58 Speaker 7\nOhh bye. Ohh Speaker 6. I did want to say we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type.\n00:38:25 Speaker 6\nType in. See.\n00:38:29 Speaker 7\nOK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 1, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 3 and Speaker 1, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:25 Speaker 6\nWhere are you sending the link for me?\n00:39:28\nOK.\n00:39:30 Speaker 7\nSo.\n00:39:30 Speaker 6\nMuticus.\n00:39:33 Speaker 7\nIt's in the chat, Speaker 6, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:39:45 Speaker 6\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:39:51 Speaker 7\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on. Your. IPad but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:18 Speaker 6\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:22 Speaker 7\nOK, four. E-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:33 Speaker 1\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Claire sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it the QUADRA survey. That one. So we send that we fill that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to. Send later on in the week.\n00:40:55 Speaker 7\nYeah, for the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders, so. OK, just share some feedback on what you explored and Claire had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:08 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:41:09 Speaker 7\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one. For this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us, so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n00:41:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Bye. Thank you.\n00:41:48 Speaker 3\nSee you later on.\n00:42:05 Speaker 1\nOK.

Who has it all? Well, you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:09 Speaker 5\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:11 Speaker 7\nSo funny. OK, who had this? That was not me. I think it's you.\n00:43:14 Speaker 2\nEqual. OK here I stopped it. Stop it. Wait, why is it? Stop being recording. OK? I don't know.\n00:43:25 Speaker 7\nIt's recording, I don't know.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.A.  \n**Date:** 07-25-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Setting:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M.A. is participating in a session to assess the use of technology for reminders and entertainment.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old male with visual impairment. During the session, he demonstrated the ability to set reminders and appointments using his Alexa device. He expressed satisfaction with his ability to independently set a reminder for a class at 5:45 PM and a timer for the evening. M.A. enjoys watching sports, particularly ice hockey, and playing video games. He relies on a caregiver to assist him with details about games and uses auditory games designed for visually impaired individuals, such as \"Shadow of the Veil.\" M.A. also expressed interest in listening to music and watching movies, indicating a preference for clean versions of songs.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**  \n- **General:** No weight loss or appetite changes reported.  \n- **Entertainment Activities:** Enjoys sports, video games, and music.  \n- **Technology Use:** Uses Alexa for reminders and entertainment, including music and games.\n\n**Current Medications:** None reported.  \n**Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Laboratory Data:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Imaging Results:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Other Diagnostic Data:** M.A. successfully set reminders and engaged with the Alexa device, demonstrating understanding and ability to use technology for entertainment and scheduling.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem 1:** Visual impairment affecting independent engagement with technology.  \n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Visual impairment (primary diagnosis)\n     - Cognitive impairment (less likely, as M.A. demonstrates understanding and engagement)\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. shows good cognitive function and ability to use technology effectively with assistance. His visual impairment necessitates adaptations in how he interacts with media and technology.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Technology Training:**\n   - Continue to provide training on using Alexa for reminders, music, and games.\n   - Explore additional auditory games compatible with M.A.'s needs.\n\n2. **Entertainment Options:**\n   - Encourage M.A. to explore streaming services (e.g., Apple Music, Spotify) to enhance his music experience.\n   - Discuss the possibility of integrating Netflix for audio descriptions of shows and movies.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess M.A.'s progress with technology use and engagement in entertainment activities.\n   - Provide resources for auditory games and apps that are accessible for visually impaired users.\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - Educate M.A. and his caregiver on the importance of using technology to enhance independence and engagement in leisure activities.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:** M.A. demonstrated enthusiasm and capability in using technology, indicating a positive outlook on his ability to engage with entertainment and reminders independently. Further support and resources will be beneficial in enhancing his experience. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Alignment with Target Note Structure**: The generated SOAP note should more closely follow the structure and content of the target note. This includes focusing on the specific interactions during the session, such as M.A.'s use of Alexa and the involvement of his mother. By aligning the structure, the generated note can better match the target note's format and content.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Specific Details**: The target note provides detailed accounts of M.A.'s interactions with Alexa, including specific commands practiced and the level of assistance required. The generated note should incorporate these details to reduce the loss score. This includes mentioning the specific commands M.A. practiced, the success rate, and any assistance or cueing provided by his mother or clinicians.\n\n3. **Focus on User Needs Assessment**: The target note emphasizes the user needs assessment and the level of cueing required for M.A. to participate effectively. The generated note should include this focus, detailing the assessment process and the specific needs identified during the session.\n\n4. **Omission of Unnecessary Sections**: The generated note includes sections like \"Chief Complaint\" and \"Differential Diagnosis,\" which are not present in the target note. Removing these sections can help the generated note better match the target note's content and focus.\n\n5. **Detailed Plan Section**: The target note includes a detailed plan with specific tasks and commands for M.A. to practice at home. The generated note should incorporate these specific tasks and commands to align with the target note's level of detail and specificity.\n\n6. **Tone and Detail Consistency**: The target note provides a detailed and specific account of M.A.'s interactions and the involvement of his mother. The generated note should aim to match this level of detail and specificity, ensuring that the tone and focus are consistent with the target note.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving the objective function more effectively. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Patient Information**: The generated note includes specific patient information (name, date) that is not present in the target note, which lacks patient identifiers.\n\n2. **Subjective Section**: The generated note focuses on M.A.'s difficulties with the Alexa device related to recipes and shopping lists, while the target note emphasizes the use of voice commands for functional activities related to ADLs. The target note also includes a motivational aspect regarding the patient's readiness to participate, which is absent in the generated note.\n\n3. **Objective Section**: The target note provides specific data on user needs and performance in trials with the Alexa device, including success rates and the type of verbal cues given. The generated note lacks detailed performance metrics and does not quantify the patient's success in using the device.\n\n4. **Assessment Section**: The generated note includes a differential diagnosis and a discussion about device limitations, which is not present in the target note. The target note focuses more on the patient's progress towards specific goals related to voice command usage.\n\n5. **Plan Section**: The generated note outlines a plan that includes device optimization and patient education, but it does not specify a measurable goal like the target note does (e.g., using concise voice commands with 80% accuracy). The target note also includes a homework assignment and a metacognitive strategy, which are not mentioned in the generated note.\n\nOverall, while both notes address the use of technology for assistance, the generated note diverges significantly in focus, detail, and structure compared to the target SOAP note. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-15-2024 (Week 5) M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Clinician\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient R.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Clinician\nSpeaker 11: Clinician\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 12: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver\nSpeaker 13: Clinician\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:02 Speaker 1\nPerfect. I think. I think we just needed that just the switch. Yeah. Ohh it did not OK.\n00:00:12 Speaker 2\nScreen she does.\n00:00:13 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2, can you, can you try read me the most popular recipes?\n00:00:21 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the popular recipes?\n00:00:28 Speaker 4\nHere are the popular recipes for the day.\n00:00:33 Speaker 1\nNo, still not telling you, huh? That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes. The caregiver and M.A. discussed various commands to improve the interaction with the device, including specific phrases to elicit better responses. M.A. expressed frustration with the device not reading out options clearly and the need for more straightforward commands. The caregiver suggested exploring different devices that might better suit M.A.'s needs.\n\n**History:**\n- **Medical History:** No significant medical history reported.\n- **Surgical History:** Not specified.\n- **Family History:** Not specified.\n- **Social History:** M.A. is engaged in a group therapy program focusing on meal preparation and dietary needs.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**\n- No allergies reported.\n- No other symptoms mentioned.\n\n**Current Medications:** Not specified.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:** Not documented.\n\n**Physical Exam Findings:** Not documented.\n\n**Laboratory Data:** Not applicable.\n\n**Imaging Results:** Not applicable.\n\n**Other Diagnostic Data:** \n- M.A. successfully interacted with the Alexa device to retrieve a recipe for Mac and cheese, but faced challenges in getting the device to read options and ingredients clearly.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem:** Difficulty using Alexa for recipe retrieval and shopping list management.\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Potential misunderstanding of device commands.\n     - Device limitations in reading options aloud.\n     - Need for a more suitable device (e.g., Echo Dot) for M.A.'s needs.\n\n**Discussion:** M.A. and the caregiver discussed various commands and settings that could improve the interaction with the Alexa device. The clinician noted the importance of finding a device that can better accommodate M.A.'s needs, especially in terms of auditory feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Device Optimization:**\n   - Research and explore settings on the Alexa device to enhance its ability to read recipes and options aloud.\n   - Consider trialing an Echo Dot or similar device that may provide better auditory feedback.\n\n2. **Patient Education:**\n   - Educate M.A. and the caregiver on specific commands that may yield better results when interacting with the device.\n   - Encourage practice with commands in a supportive environment to build confidence.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess improvements in device interaction and address any ongoing challenges.\n   - Discuss dietary preferences and restrictions in future sessions to tailor recipe suggestions.\n\n4. **Additional Resources:**\n   - Provide resources or links to online forums or support groups for users of similar devices to share tips and experiences.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n- M.A. has shown improvement in vocalizing commands and engaging with the group therapy sessions.\n- The clinician will continue to monitor M.A.'s progress and adapt the plan as necessary to ensure effective use of technology in meal preparation and shopping management. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Alignment with Target Note**: The generated SOAP note should more closely align with the target note's focus on using voice commands for functional activities related to ADLs. This means shifting the emphasis from recipe and shopping list management to broader ADL-related tasks, such as setting timers or playing music, as seen in the target note.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Motivational Aspects**: The target note highlights the patient's motivation and readiness to participate, which is absent in the generated note. Including a section that assesses the patient's motivation and engagement level could provide a more comprehensive view of the patient's subjective experience.\n\n3. **Detailed Performance Metrics**: The target note provides specific performance metrics, such as success rates in trials with the Alexa device. The generated note should include similar quantitative data to assess the patient's progress and success in using the device, which would make the objective section more robust.\n\n4. **Specific Goals and Strategies**: The target note outlines specific goals, such as achieving 80% accuracy in using voice commands. The generated note should incorporate measurable goals and strategies, such as setting a target success rate for device interactions, to provide clear objectives for the patient's progress.\n\n5. **Homework and Metacognitive Strategies**: The target note includes a plan for homework and metacognitive strategies to reflect on device usage. Incorporating these elements into the generated note could enhance the plan section by encouraging the patient to actively engage with the technology and reflect on their experiences.\n\n6. **Consistency in Structure and Detail**: The generated note should maintain consistency in structure and detail with the target note. This includes ensuring that each section (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) is comprehensive and mirrors the level of detail found in the target note.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving a closer alignment with the desired output. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET: Subjective  (S):   M.A.  logged  onto  his  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?\u201d  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  \u201cTrazadone\u201d  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week\u2019s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. \u201cIs there a fact you would like to know?\u201d) M.A. practice the following commands: -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?\u201d  -  \u201c Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cFor  the  gym\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  stop\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?\u201d  -  \u201cAlexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?\u201d  -  \u201cHey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?\u201d  -  \u201cHey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?\u201d   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying \u201csuch as___\u201d to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.\u2019s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as \u201cWho do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?\u201d  and  \u201cIs  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?\u201d.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  news  and  facts.  Please  practice  these  five commands with your Alexa. Record each command you practice and then submit it to researchers  Task  1:  Telling  Joke  1.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  a  joke\u201d   Task  2:  Asking  for  the  Weather  2.  \u201cAlexa,  what\u2019s  the  weather?\u201d   Task  3:  Asking  for  News  3.  \u201cAlexa,  play  flash  briefing\u201d   Task  4:  Searching  for  Information  4.  \u201cAlexa,  tell  me  where  I  can  buy  cold  medicine\u201d  5.  \u201cAlexa,  where  is  the  nearest  gas  station?\u201d  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-08-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Individual training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver \nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A. \nSpeaker 3: Clinician \nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa \nSpeaker 5: Clinician \nSpeaker 6: Clinician \nSpeaker 7: Patient M.A.\u2019s Second Caregiver \nSpeaker 8: Clinician\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nWe did the. Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news. Anything and everything.\n00:06:34 Speaker 1\nDetails.\n00:06:34 Speaker 3\nOK. Can you can you give me some examples, Speaker 2?\n00:06:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:06:47 Speaker 1\nWho do you listen to every morning with your father?\n00:06:49 Speaker 2\nArmstrong and Betty.\n00:06:52 Speaker 1\nHe listens to a radio podcast, Armstrong and Getty.\n00:06:57 Speaker 3\nArmstrong and Gary. OK, the two fellows.\n00:06:59 Speaker 1\nThat's the name of.\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, Armstrong and. Daddy, you said GADY.\n00:07:08 Speaker 2\nG22Y.\n00:07:10 Speaker 3\nGDT OK, getting OK. Perfect. All right. What else? Is there anything else?\n00:07:21 Speaker 1\nDo you listen to any other news with your father?\n00:07:23 Speaker 2\nDan bongino.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nI think that's another one of those podcast things.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK, so like radio podcasts again, OK.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nYes, yes. How about politics?\n00:07:35 Speaker 3\nOr like current affairs or traffic or any like local news that's been going around you. Any of that that you like to sort of know about?\n00:07:49 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:07:50 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nIs that is the news on all day? Ohh so they do they listen to more talk radio and news stations on TV?\n00:08:03 Speaker 3\nOK. All right.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nGot you.\n00:08:08 Speaker 3\nAlright. OK. And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two? What would you like to know?\n00:09:14 Speaker 2\nMr. Longo.\n00:09:16 Speaker 1\nNo, no, no. The device, what would you ask her?\n00:09:21 Speaker 2\nI would ask her about. WW2.\n00:09:26 Speaker 1\nOK, so do you want them to ask your question? Ask ask her a question.\n00:09:34 Speaker 2\nWas Armstrong and Getty and WW2?\n00:09:42 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:09:45 Speaker 3\nOK, we will.\n00:09:47 Speaker 1\nTry again. Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm. What about the Olympics?\n00:10:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How many medals has Russia won?\n00:10:44 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:10:46 Speaker 4\nIn 2024 Olympics, Russia has not found any medals yet. Did that answer your question?\n00:10:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nThat's good.\n00:10:54 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 2, thanks, Speaker 1.\n00:10:56 Speaker 3\nOK, alright, perfect. OK. All right. OK.\n00:11:08 Speaker 1\nI did not receive that e-mail.\n00:11:10 Speaker 3\nNo, you did not. OK, I will resend it. I have that. I I'm. I'm sort of. I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model and address the feedback on the LM_OUTPUT, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Alignment with Target Note Structure**: The generated SOAP note should more closely follow the structure and content of the target note. This includes focusing on the specific details of M.A.'s session, such as the involvement of his mother, the nature of verbal cues, and the specific commands practiced. By aligning the structure, the generated note will better match the target note, reducing the loss score.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Session Details**: The target note provides a detailed account of the session, including specific commands M.A. practiced and the interactions with his mother and clinician. The generated note should incorporate these details to provide a comprehensive view of the session. This includes listing the specific commands practiced and describing the dynamics of the session, such as the need for prompting and redirection.\n\n3. **Focus on Interaction Dynamics**: The target note emphasizes the interaction between M.A., his mother, and the clinician. The generated note should reflect this by highlighting the role of M.A.'s mother in providing verbal cues and support. This focus on interaction dynamics is crucial for accurately capturing the essence of the session.\n\n4. **Reduction of Clinical Perspective**: The generated note introduces a clinical perspective with differential diagnoses and a structured plan, which is not present in the target note. To improve alignment, the generated note should reduce the emphasis on clinical analysis and instead focus on the practical aspects of the session, such as the specific commands and homework assignments.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Homework Assignments**: The target note includes specific homework assignments related to the session. The generated note should incorporate these assignments to provide a complete picture of the session's objectives and follow-up actions.\n\n6. **Consistency in Content and Focus**: The generated note should maintain consistency in content and focus with the target note. This includes ensuring that all relevant details from the target note are present in the generated note, such as the specific commands practiced and the role of M.A.'s mother in the session.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby achieving a lower loss score and meeting the objective function more effectively. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

Return a higher loss score for greater differences.\n\nTARGET:   Subjective  (S):  MA  logged  in  for  the  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   \u201cHey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes\u201d   \u201cAlexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa  can  you  repeat?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes\u201d  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  check  off  gum\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese\u201d   \u201cRead  me  option  one\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  option  two\u201d  \u201cAlexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk\u201d  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  what\u2019s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?\u201d  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe\u201d  \u201cHey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?\u201d  \u201cHey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?\u201d  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?\u201d   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance \u201cAlexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese\u201d led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command \u201c Alexa, read me option one\u201d led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA\u2019s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn\u2019t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  \u201cAlexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list\u201d  Command  2:  \u201cAlexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list\u201d   Command  3:  \u201cAlexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  \u201cAlexa,  clear  my  shopping  list\u201d   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers\u201d   \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-01-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Breakout room training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Clinician\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient F.W.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Patient L.V.G.\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nRecording. So we're gonna go over some questions related to self-care and medical needs today. So first of all, though, we're going to do a little review of the last week's comments. So you're going to show me how you can play music, play music, or a video of your choice with your Speaker 4 device. So you want to go ahead and do that? Speaker 2, do you want to give it a command?\n00:00:37 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you play? A video from. January 3rd. OK.\n00:00:56 Speaker 1\nDoes it? Is it playing anything?\n00:00:58 Speaker 3\nYes it is.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:01:00 Speaker 3\nI hooked up Speaker 2's apple music. To the elect. Don't ask me how I did it, but. I figured it out. OK. We did hook it up and he's been able. He's been using that feature a lot, he'll say, play Bon Jovi or and it will just start playing a. Yeah. Bunch of Bon Jovi songs.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK. So when?\n00:01:27 Speaker 3\nBut I do have a question.\n00:01:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, go ahead. Yeah.\n00:01:31 Speaker 3\nThat just turn it off, Speaker 2.\n00:01:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:38 Speaker 3\nLouder.\n00:01:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:01:42 Speaker 3\nIt's muted. That's fine.\n00:01:43 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:48 Speaker 3\nIn in relation to the music, Speaker 2 listens to a radio station in the mornings. It's a KC 790.\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nUh-huh.\n00:01:59 Speaker 3\nSo is there a way to hook that up as well?\n00:02:04 Speaker 1\nThere should be actually.\n00:02:08 Speaker 3\nAnd if not, I believe the show he listens to is on that iheart app. So I don't, I do, we don't have that either, but I those are that was part part one and we could hook it up then it would be the same way. Part 2 is Speaker 2 gets books from. Guard. Which is for from Berlin Institute their books. It's a reading library and you choose your books on Bard and then you can play. Listen to your books. Is it possible to hook that up to Speaker 4 or should it just be YouTube? On YouTube you can actually listen to all kinds of stories as well.\n00:02:51 Speaker 1\nRight, so I'm pretty. Sure that the audible, I I don't know if you know there's a there's a website called Audible which has audible books. I'm pretty sure that can be hooked up to Speaker 4. I am not very sure about about the board. OK. But I can check and let you know about that one. Yeah, I I can research a little bit and maybe maybe get back to you is it called Bard Bard.\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOhh OK. Correct. OK. It's rail institute.\n00:03:25 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK, alright, let me check I I almost wonder if if it could be. Synced into your phone. And because your phones Speaker 4 is synced in with the Speaker 4 on the Echo. So if it could be played on the phone, it could be played on here, but I will check and let.\n00:03:44 Speaker 4\nUh-huh.\n00:03:51 Speaker 1\nYou know for sure.\n00:03:52 Speaker 3\nOK. And just so you know, I put the Bard app is on his iPad and I put the Speaker 4 app on the iPad.\n00:03:58 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nAnd they're both and. The pad is linked to the.\n00:04:02 Speaker 1\nPhone, phone. Perfect. So, alright. OK. I can. I can look that up for sure. One was the Bard and then other one was the.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nOh.\n00:04:11 Speaker 1\nMusic. You said. No. What? What was that?\n00:04:13 Speaker 3\nAt the radio station, it's OK.\n00:04:15 Speaker 1\nRadio station about yes.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nAt K ABC 790 OK Yeah 790.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nABC.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAll right. So all right, those are very specific questions, so.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nI didn't. Well, we're we're trying.\n00:04:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, no, that's perfect. But so Speaker 2, I had a question. So when you said Speaker 4 play a video from January 3rd, what did it bring up? Did it, was it anything specific that what what did was that the command that he that you gave?\n00:04:48 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what command did you give?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nJust command.\n00:04:53 Speaker 3\nCan you repeat it? Yeah. What was it?\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nYou like to play. New memory from January 3rd.\n00:05:03 Speaker 3\nA memory from January.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\n3rd memory OK, play a memory from OK. So did it. What did it bring up? I'm just curious.\n00:05:14 Speaker 3\nIt did. It was a video and then the music started playing.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nFor you.\n00:05:20 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK. All right, but. Very nice, Speaker 2. I mean, I'm, I'm so impressed. All right, so.\n00:05:31 Speaker 4\nThat for you.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:05:34 Speaker 1\nAll right, perfect. All right, Speaker 2. So let's move over to this week's topic. What type? So I have a few questions I want to ask you. First, initially to 1st ASK is is like what is your goal when it comes to self-care and medical needs? Using Speaker 4, what would you say your goal is?\n00:06:02 Speaker 3\nFor health and medical needs, Speaker 2 to use Speaker 4.\n00:06:04 Speaker 2\nHow's the mass on each? Here. Brushing my teeth.\n00:06:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright. What did you what? What else did you say?\n00:06:23 Speaker 3\nTrimming his nails.\n00:06:25 Speaker 1\nOK, trimming the nails. Perfect. Alright. Anything else you can think of?\n00:06:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, eating breakfast.\n00:06:36 Speaker 1\nCorrect. So eating meals on time?\n00:06:39 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:06:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n00:07:07 Speaker 3\nAre you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:07:16 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n00:07:40 Speaker 2\nMy iPhone.\n00:07:42 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n00:07:56 Speaker 3\nAre you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n00:08:00 Speaker 2\nMaking reminders on the iPhone.\n00:08:04 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nSo OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n00:08:50 Speaker 3\nIf I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n00:09:06 Speaker 1\nGot it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n00:10:11 Speaker 2\nSo I can. Make goals.\n00:10:17 Speaker 3\nMake goals.\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:21 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n00:11:00 Speaker 3\nWould you like her to remind you?\n00:11:04 Speaker 3\nTo eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n00:11:12 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:11:15 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nBrushing my teeth.\n00:11:37 Speaker 3\nBrushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n00:11:40 Speaker 1\nAll right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n00:12:13 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n00:12:27 Speaker 1\nYours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nThe same right? And that makes like more.\n00:12:49 Speaker 1\nYou think of that, Speaker 2?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nThat's a good idea.\n00:12:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n00:13:59 Speaker 3\nFair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n00:14:13 Speaker 4\nMHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nThat'd be good. OK.\n00:14:21 Speaker 3\nBecause I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n00:14:31 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:14:31 Speaker 3\nWould be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n00:14:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n00:14:54 Speaker 3\nOK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n00:15:09 Speaker 1\nUh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n00:15:12 Speaker 3\nA barred book is what I'm thinking.\n00:15:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n00:15:25 Speaker 3\nOh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n00:15:42 Speaker 1\nYou know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n00:16:19 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n00:16:21 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n00:16:40 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:16:42 Speaker 1\nI almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n00:16:46 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:16:47 Speaker 1\nThe device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n00:16:50 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:17:08 Speaker 1\nBecause there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n00:17:19 Speaker 3\nWell, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n00:17:26 Speaker 1\nThat's all.\n00:17:31 Speaker 3\nFeel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n00:17:35 Speaker 1\nThat would be great.\n00:17:35 Speaker 3\nCould behind.\n00:17:38 Speaker 1\nThat would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n00:17:44 Speaker 3\nOK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n00:17:52 Speaker 1\nOhh OK Speaker 2.\n00:17:57 Speaker 3\nThey were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n00:18:05 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:18:08 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:18:08 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:18:11 Speaker 3\nThere. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n00:18:15 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:18:16 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n00:18:41 Speaker 1\nYeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n00:18:49 Speaker 3\nBut an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n00:18:53 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:18:55 Speaker 3\nDo I just say to open the bar app?\n00:18:59 Speaker 1\nYeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n00:19:03 Speaker 3\nOK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n00:19:25 Speaker 1\nNo, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n00:19:57 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nSearching for the.\n00:20:04 Speaker 3\nBard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n00:20:12 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:20:14 Speaker 4\nCouncil.\n00:20:15 Speaker 1\nIs there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n00:21:05 Speaker 4\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n00:21:08 Speaker 3\nOK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n00:21:18 Speaker 4\nSearching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n00:21:19 Speaker 3\nIt's not understanding the bars.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nThat's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n00:21:26 Speaker 3\nMaybe yeah.\n00:21:29 Speaker 1\nAnother another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n00:21:59 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:02 Speaker 1\nTo.\n00:22:04 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n00:22:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n00:22:25 Speaker 3\nNope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nIs Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n00:22:46 Speaker 3\nNo, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nIt's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n00:22:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nIt's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n00:23:15 Speaker 3\nI'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n00:23:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n00:23:48 Speaker 4\nMy.\n00:23:52 Speaker 1\nAlright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n00:24:20 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:24:21 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n00:24:46 Speaker 3\nThe breakout room.\n00:24:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:24:48 Speaker 3\nOK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n00:24:51 Speaker 1\nAbsolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- \nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 2.\n00:25:10 Speaker 2\nHey, what's up?\n00:25:12 Speaker 1\nAlright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n00:25:50 Speaker 3\nUnmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n00:26:07 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:26:11 Speaker 3\nOK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n00:26:12 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Could.\n00:26:21 Speaker 1\nOK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:28 Speaker 2\nOK. Thank you.\n00:26:30 Speaker 3\nGo ahead.\n00:26:31 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:44 Speaker 4\nI've checked off oranges from medication.\n00:26:47 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:26:49 Speaker 1\nOhh did it say check off?\n00:26:49 Speaker 3\nAnd. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n00:26:55 Speaker 1\nNo longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n00:27:25 Speaker 2\nIbuprofen.\n00:27:27 Speaker 1\nOK, well you have been.\n00:27:28 Speaker 3\nWhat's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n00:27:38 Speaker 2\nTypical.\n00:27:39 Speaker 3\nOK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n00:27:42 Speaker 2\nEvery day.\n00:27:43 Speaker 3\nAt what time? In the morning it's at.\n00:27:53 Speaker 2\n7:30.\n00:27:55 Speaker 3\nOK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n00:28:00 Speaker 1\nOK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n00:28:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n00:28:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n00:28:22 Speaker 3\n10.\n00:28:23 Speaker 1\n7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to take Depakote at 7:30 AM tomorrow.\n00:28:42 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:47 Speaker 1\nOK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n00:29:09 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:29:10 Speaker 1\nOK, let's do that command.\n00:29:15 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n00:29:31 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n00:29:36 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n00:30:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:30:29 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away on Canyon Way, right? A 1.4 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite 110, Walgreens 2.3 miles away on Haven Ave. you can ask me for things like what's the phone number for the first one?\n00:30:51 Speaker 1\nOK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n00:31:04 Speaker 3\nIf that makes sense.\n00:31:07 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n00:31:49 Speaker 3\nJust so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nRight, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n00:32:08 Speaker 3\nJust so you. You had a heads up and. So you you know what?\n00:32:13 Speaker 1\nI mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n00:32:45 Speaker 3\nHe didn't.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I do my laundry?\n00:32:59 Speaker 1\nDid it pick it up?\n00:33:01 Speaker 3\nIt it's showing it's. A video and pictures and a lot of words on how to do it. Let me just make sure the volumes up, yeah, the volumes 3/4.\n00:33:14 Speaker 1\nOh, OK.\n00:33:16 Speaker 3\nIt picked it up but it. I don't know if my cord. Will reach the camera.\n00:33:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Is it is it more visual? Maybe like rather than ohh it's like a very text. It's all.\n00:33:30 Speaker 3\nIt's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n00:33:36 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n00:33:59 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Give me the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:12 Speaker 3\nIt's doing the same thing, the same thing. Try tell me how to do laundry that way you're telling her to? Read it to. You.\n00:34:21 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:34:22 Speaker 3\nSorry again, Speaker 2.\n00:34:25 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Hey, Speaker 4. Tell me how to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:40 Speaker 3\nIt's written again. It's written again. OK, OK, directions. Speaker 2.\n00:34:50 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me the directions to do my laundry.\n00:34:58 Speaker 4\nAt the moment, traffic to vineyards marketplace cleaners at 11460 Canyon Way looks pretty clear.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nOhh it's giving like.\n00:35:05 Speaker 4\nJust about 3 minutes via Canyon with her place.\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's a.\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nYeah. It's like a laundromat. Probably gets. Right. OK, alright. Alright, let's try another one. OK, let's try this set reminder to do laundry. Maybe that's a function more functional one. I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n00:35:54 Speaker 2\nM. OK.\n00:35:57 Speaker 3\nGo.\n00:35:58 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to. Do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:05 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:36:07 Speaker 2\nTo do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:11 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:36:12 Speaker 2\nTomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:20 Speaker 4\nIs that 5:00? In the morning or in the afternoon.\n00:36:22 Speaker 2\nIn the afternoon.\n00:36:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.\n00:36:32 Speaker 1\nBye. Purpose. OK, good job. Does these kind of reminders help Speaker 2? Maybe. That would be more functional in the real life, you think.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 1\nAlright, yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. When I asked Speaker 2, I was cooking and I asked him to set the timer for me and that was very optional. Yes.\n00:36:57 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, that is great.\n00:37:01 Speaker 3\nAnd she even told. Speaker 4, to set my mom at the time.\n00:37:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. So. OK. OK. All right, so getting stains out of clothes. What else?\n00:37:19 Speaker 3\nOK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n00:37:21 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n00:37:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:37:44 Speaker 3\nWhat?\n00:37:44 Speaker 2\nWhat do I use to get a stain out of my clothes?\n00:37:52 Speaker 4\nTo remove stains from clothes, rinse the stain with cold water and scrub it with the brush and soap. If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in cold water and soak for an hour. Then wash the clothing as usual.\n00:38:06 Speaker 3\nThis one showed the words in paragraph as well as Reddit.\n00:38:11 Speaker 1\nThat's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n00:38:18 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:38:37 Speaker 1\nText. But. I almost wonder for the laundry part. If we'd ask her to give me the first step to do my laundry or something like that.\n00:38:51 Speaker 3\nYeah. Try that, Speaker 2.\n00:38:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you give me the first step to do my laundry?\n00:39:06 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:39:08 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n00:39:41 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:39:41 Speaker 3\nI think that was the paragraph that she didn't read before.\n00:39:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, but it read. It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n00:40:20 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:40:24 Speaker 1\nDo you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n00:40:48 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. When do I use the fabric softener?\n00:40:57 Speaker 4\nAccording to an Speaker 4 Answers contributor. Add fabric softener to the wash during the rinse cycle.\n00:41:05 Speaker 1\nOK. All right.\n00:41:08 Speaker 3\nMakes sense?\n00:41:09 Speaker 1\nOK, I think this is pretty functional here. So Speaker 2 say that you have a headache and you need some answers on how to treat it on your own. So you're going to say the wake word and say, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:32 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:42 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for a migraine include applying ice packs to the back of the neck, forehead or temples, taking a nap, taking a warm shower or bath, massage, drinking water resting in a low lit room, or physical therapy.\n00:42:00 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. OK. All right, let's do the same for stomach pains. OK, so say you have a sudden stomach pain and you want to know what remedies you can use. So you're going to say the wake word. And what do I take for stomach pains? Ready. Cool.\n00:42:27 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:35 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:42:38 Speaker 4\nHuh.\n00:42:40 Speaker 1\nInteresting. Let me try that one more time, OK. On mine, Speaker 4, mute. What do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:55 Speaker 4\nI don't know that one.\n00:42:58 Speaker 1\nIt says the same thing for me too.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nOh wow.\n00:43:02 Speaker 1\nYeah. So we'll have to try that one one more time.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n00:43:14 Speaker 1\nOK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n00:43:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:43:27 Speaker 1\nUh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:09 Speaker 3\nWhat kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:20 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. All Star physical therapy 3.1 miles away on Rochester Ave. Suite 110, team Physical therapy, 3 miles away on Town Center. Dr. Rancho San Antonio Rehab Center, 2.3 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite G30.\n00:44:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n00:45:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's.\n00:45:21 Speaker 2\nYeah it does.\n00:45:24 Speaker 1\nOK, I think we are through with the slides. Let me stop sharing my screen. OK. Any questions about anything we did today?\n00:45:37 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:45:38 Speaker 1\nNo. OK, how about you?\n00:45:40 Speaker 3\nMom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n00:45:51 Speaker 4\nHmm.\n00:45:53 Speaker 3\nI'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n00:45:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n00:46:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:46:49 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:49 Speaker 3\nYou know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n00:46:55 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:47:01 Speaker 3\nDo you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n00:47:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n00:47:40 Speaker 3\nSo I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:47:58 Speaker 4\nYou.\n00:47:59 Speaker 4\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n00:48:01 Speaker 1\nYeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n00:48:01 Speaker 3\nAnd it was.\n00:48:20 Speaker 1\nBecause once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n00:48:33 Speaker 3\nRight. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n00:48:55 Speaker 1\nYes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n00:50:15 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:50:16 Speaker 1\nError. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n00:50:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n00:50:32 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:50:33 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:50:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n00:50:44 Speaker 3\nOhh no, I think we're good, thank.\n00:50:45 Speaker 1\nYou OK? Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and I. Hey. Will get back to you, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:50:57 Speaker 4\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will be oh. I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slide a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So expect another homework for this week, self-care inform. Just just to double check that you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two, you got all the slides. I know, Speaker 6, you got it, Speaker 2, you got it. OK, Speaker 10, you got it too. Yeah. I need to do mine.\n00:51:40 Speaker 10\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n00:51:49 Speaker 4\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Speaker 9, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our part point training. So after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be anytime. But if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd, the so think week six. If you go by numbers in. Your head.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:52:42 Speaker 4\nWeek 6 we would like to hear from you. Just we were asking some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well, you can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share. Together, because chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel, feel free to bring them as well. And I'll send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n00:53:31 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:53:33 Speaker 4\nAny questions?\n00:53:34 Speaker 5\nSorry. Speaker 6, we we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 6, if you still want to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and. Then we'll let. You go, I promise. Sounds good. OK. OK.\n00:53:47 Speaker 4\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can debrief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday.\n00:54:04 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:54:07 Speaker 4\nAll right, Speaker 6, I'm going to open the breakout room. OK. Uh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 6 and Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 can go. And don't forget to record. OK.\n00:54:21 Speaker 2\nYou want me to join or not?\n00:54:23 Speaker 4\nYes, Speaker 6, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going. To change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Gina.\n00:54:44 Speaker 4\nYay, great job.\n00:54:47 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:54:48 Speaker 5\nDid you see?\n00:54:48 Speaker 4\nThe stop recording or who is recording now just telling. Oh yeah, there it is. OK. Oh my goodness. You did. It's amazing job. Gina, I just love how you provided so many solutions on the spot. I was like, this is how a well versed trainer who knows her system can do because there were some of those. I'm like, well, you know. What I don't know, he can do. Like like I can do it. So I was literally like, I'm learning from Tina because I haven't explored. Those. List function. It's super helpful.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities. The patient\u2019s caregiver reports that M.A. has been using the device to play music and videos, set reminders for medications, and manage self-care tasks such as brushing teeth and trimming nails. The patient expresses a desire to improve independence in managing these tasks.\n\n**Goals for Self-Care:**\n- Use technology to remember daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals on time).\n- Set reminders for medication intake (currently taking medications twice daily).\n- Explore additional functionalities of the Alexa device to assist with self-care and medical needs.\n\n**Current Medications:**\n- Depakote (dosage and frequency not specified, but taken twice daily).\n\n**Social History:**\n- M.A. is supported by a caregiver who assists with technology and daily tasks.\n- The patient has access to an iPhone and an iPad, which are used to set reminders and manage tasks.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**\n- No acute symptoms reported; focus is on technology use for self-care management.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Physical Exam Findings:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Technology Assessment:**\n- M.A. successfully used the Alexa device to play music and videos.\n- Caregiver reports that M.A. has set reminders for medications on the iPhone.\n- Discussion about integrating additional functionalities of the Alexa device for reminders related to self-care tasks.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem 1: Difficulty in managing self-care tasks independently.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Lack of familiarity with technology.\n     - Need for structured reminders for daily tasks.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. is currently reliant on caregivers for reminders and assistance with self-care tasks. The use of technology is a positive step towards independence, but further integration and training are needed.\n\n2. **Problem 2: Medication management.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:**\n     - Potential for missed doses if reminders are not effectively set.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. takes medications twice daily and has set reminders on the iPhone. There is a need to ensure that the Alexa device can also assist with medication reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **For Self-Care Management:**\n   - Explore the possibility of setting up a checklist on the Alexa device for daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals).\n   - Research the integration of the Bard app for audiobooks and other reading materials to be accessible via the Alexa device.\n   - Consider implementing tactile markers (bump dots) on the Alexa device to assist M.A. in independently using the mute/unmute functions.\n\n2. **For Medication Management:**\n   - Confirm that reminders for medication intake can be set on the Alexa device.\n   - Educate M.A. on how to use the Alexa device to check off medications taken and set reminders for refills.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess the effectiveness of the implemented strategies and make adjustments as necessary.\n   - Encourage the caregiver to continue supporting M.A. in using the technology and to provide feedback on its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - Provide M.A. and the caregiver with resources on how to maximize the use of the Alexa device for self-care and medication management.\n\n---\n\n**Signature:**\n[Clinician's Name]  \n[Clinician's Title]  \n[Date]   </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system. The <LM_OUTPUT> was later used as response from the language model.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the LM_OUTPUT: To improve the response from the language model and better align it with the target SOAP note, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Alignment with Target Focus**: The generated SOAP note should more closely align with the target note's focus on meal preparation and the use of Alexa for cooking-related tasks. This requires a shift in the subjective section to emphasize M.A.'s involvement in cooking, dietary restrictions, and specific user scenarios where Alexa is beneficial.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Specific Details**: The target note includes detailed scenarios and commands related to meal preparation, which are absent in the generated note. Incorporating these specifics, such as the use of Alexa for setting timers, finding recipes, and managing dietary restrictions, would enhance the relevance and accuracy of the generated note.\n\n3. **Objective Section Enhancement**: While the generated note does not assess vital signs or physical exam findings, it should include a detailed technology assessment related to meal preparation, similar to the target note. This could involve describing M.A.'s interactions with Alexa during cooking tasks and any challenges faced due to blindness.\n\n4. **Assessment Section Focus**: The assessment should address the challenges M.A. faces in cooking and using Alexa for meal preparation, as highlighted in the target note. This includes discussing the need for verbal prompts, the impact of blindness on task execution, and the effectiveness of Alexa commands in assisting with meal preparation.\n\n5. **Plan Section Specificity**: The plan should be tailored to address meal preparation and Alexa training, as in the target note. This involves outlining specific tasks and commands practiced, the need for accessibility modifications, and the potential use of devices like the Echo Dot for better verbal output. Including a home exercise program with detailed tasks and commands related to cooking would also be beneficial.\n\n6. **Consistency in Terminology and Structure**: Ensure that the terminology and structure used in the generated note are consistent with the target note. This includes using similar headings, subheadings, and language to maintain coherence and clarity.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, reducing the loss score and enhancing the overall quality and relevance of the generated content. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

User  Needs:  Pt  identified  two  specific  topics  of  information  she  listens  to  the  news  for. Pt identified two topics she is currently interested in discussing or learning more about. Pt identified 9/10 scenarios to complete the sentence: \u201cI want to ask/know more about.\u201d  4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  utilized  voice  commands  to  inquire  about  information  regarding  the  weather, events on her calendar, and current news on the Alexa device in 15/17 trials in a 1:1 setting with the clinician given minimal verbal cues.   A:   3.  User  Needs:  Pt  appropriately  responded  to  all  user  needs  assessment  interview  questions. During user needs assessment, pt was thoughtful in her responses and most inquisitive about athletes competing in the 2024 Olympic games, particularly in the sports of breakdancing, swimming, and surfing. Furthermore, pt expressed interest in current news across various geographic locations.   4.  VAT  Session:  Pt  met  her  goal  of  using  concise  voice  commands  in  80%  of  trials  to  seek information regarding news and facts on the Alexa device given moderate (2-3) verbal cues. Pt demonstrated intelligible speech when verbalizing Alexa voice commands and executed 15 commands successfully and independently given an initial model. One command, \u201cwhat is the traffic like on the 405 freeway\u201d required repetition, however, was not specific enough in context for Alexa to understand and execute. In a group setting, pt demonstrated appropriate sustained attention skills and pragmatics such as turn taking and commenting.  P:  Week  4  homework  will  be  assigned.  Metacognitive  strategy  will  be  implemented  in  next  week\u2019s session to allow pt to reflect and provide feedback on use of Alexa throughout the week to discuss Alexa use for personal needs and ADLs.  \n\nScore from 0-10 where:\n- 0 = Perfect match\n- 10 = Completely different </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M. is a [age] year-old [gender] who is learning to use their Alexa device for reminders and entertainment. \n- The patient expressed satisfaction with their ability to set reminders independently, stating, \"I'm pretty happy.\"\n- Patient enjoys watching sports, particularly ice hockey, and playing video games.

Here are the key areas of divergence:\n\n1. **Subjective Content**: The target note focuses on the patient's goals related to specific information-seeking questions about the Olympics and the 2024 presidential election, while the generated note discusses the patient's interest in entertainment and leisure activities, such as sports and video games. This represents a fundamental difference in the focus of the session.\n\n2. **Goals and Objectives**: The target note includes specific measurable goals (e.g., using concise voice commands with 80% accuracy) and details about the patient's performance in trials, which are absent in the generated note. The generated note lacks quantifiable outcomes and specific goals related to the use of the Alexa device.\n\n3. **Assessment Details**: The target note provides a detailed assessment of the patient's engagement with specific topics and their performance in using voice commands, while the generated note discusses broader issues related to technology use and leisure activities without specific performance metrics.\n\n4. **Plan Specificity**: The plan in the target note includes specific homework assignments and metacognitive strategies, while the generated note outlines general training and education without specific tasks or strategies for the patient to work on.\n\n5. **Terminology and Structure**: The generated note uses different terminology and structure, such as \"Chief Complaint\" and \"History of Present Illness,\" which are not present in the target note. The target note follows a more structured format with clear sections for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan.\n\nOverall, while both notes address the use of technology and patient engagement, the differences in focus, specificity, and structure contribute to a higher loss score. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\nThis conversation is part of a larger system.

Here is a conversation with a language model (LM):\n\n<LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient. Follow this rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

OK, alright.\n00:01:28 Speaker 3\nSet a reminder for the class. He also set a reminder for a timer this evening. OK, perfect. Turn the timer off when it went went off.\n00:01:38 Speaker 2\nFaith. OK. And how are you feeling about that, Speaker 1, are you? Are you, are you happy you were able to do it independently? And do you have any thoughts about it?\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nI'm pretty happy.\n00:01:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Perfect. I like that. That's so good.\n00:01:57 Speaker 1\nMe too.\n00:01:58 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right. So let's move on to the entertainment and the leisure activities that you like to do. So tell me a little bit about what kind of. And activities you like to do when you have time on hand.\n00:02:21 Speaker 1\nWatch Sports watch sports.\n00:02:24 Speaker 2\nOK. And what kind of sports?\n00:02:28 Speaker 1\nIce hockey, OK?\n00:02:32 Speaker 2\nWhat else?\n00:02:39 Speaker 1\nPlay sports or play video games.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nOK. Alright, so playing video games. So tell me this. Umm, so now things are a little bit different. Of course a lot different I should say. What? How? How are you? So do you listen to the sports? The games that are going on or have someone like or. Someone who's sitting next to you. Tell you some. You know, kind of the details or what do you what do you usually end up doing?\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nSomeone who's sitting next to me tell.\n00:03:20 Speaker 3\nMe stuff. How did you watch the playoffs?\n00:03:24 Speaker 1\nListen to.\n00:03:25 Speaker 3\nYou listen to the playoffs, and what did I do?\n00:03:28 Speaker 1\nYou tell me why.\n00:03:30 Speaker 3\nI told told you so a little bit, but what else did? I do.\n00:03:35 Speaker 3\nAbout the game on your back.\n00:03:37 Speaker 1\nDrew.\n00:03:38 Speaker 3\nI drew the game on his back. The plays on his.\n00:03:40 Speaker 2\nWow. Ohh wow. That's amazing. That is so good.\n00:03:46 Speaker 3\nHis back became the ice.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nRink. Oh my God awesome.\n00:03:50 Speaker 3\nSo that we follow the. Yeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's amazing. Though, mom. I mean, I'm so I'm so impressed by you. Really.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nNot really. But he listened to it. And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey.

Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I. Was cracking up the entire time.\n00:43:15 Speaker 5\nI don't know how you run it with the poker face. The video who has it all?\n00:43:21 Speaker 6\nOh my God.\n00:43:27 Speaker 5\nOhh you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:32 Speaker 6\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:35 Speaker 5\nSo funny. OK, who is? I was.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M. is a [age] year-old [gender] who is learning to use their Alexa device for reminders and entertainment. \n- The patient expressed satisfaction with their ability to set reminders independently, stating, \"I'm pretty happy.\"\n- Patient enjoys watching sports, particularly ice hockey, and playing video games.

This can be achieved by incorporating details about the patient's interest in these topics and their progress in using Alexa to seek related information.\n\n2. **Incorporate Measurable Goals**: The generated note should include specific, measurable goals similar to those in the target note, such as using concise voice commands with a certain accuracy percentage. This will provide a clearer framework for assessing the patient's progress and align with the target note's emphasis on quantifiable outcomes.\n\n3. **Detailed Assessment**: The assessment section should provide detailed insights into the patient's engagement with specific topics and their performance in using voice commands. Including metrics or trial results, as seen in the target note, will enhance the specificity and relevance of the assessment.\n\n4. **Specific Plan and Strategies**: The plan should outline specific tasks or strategies for the patient to work on, such as homework assignments or metacognitive strategies. This will mirror the target note's approach and provide a clear path for the patient's continued development.\n\n5. **Consistent Terminology and Structure**: The generated note should adopt the terminology and structure used in the target note, such as avoiding terms like \"Chief Complaint\" and \"History of Present Illness\" if they are not present in the target. Ensuring consistency in format will help reduce the loss score by aligning more closely with the target note's style.\n\n6. **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure that the content of the generated note is contextually relevant to the patient's goals and the session's objectives. This includes focusing on the use of Alexa for specific information-seeking tasks rather than general entertainment and leisure activities.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the response from the language model can be improved to better match the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving the objective function more effectively. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses for this conversation.

That's odd. You know, I wonder what else? Because it should just read it out right? Like that's what I feel.\n00:00:48 Speaker 2\nI wonder if a different device that doesn't have the screen you know how there's some that don't have the screen? Yeah. Read it out, if that then it would read it out.\n00:01:01 Speaker 1\nIt might. It might. I mean, it has to right for those those devices because you don't have a screen there and you need that information, so there has to be a way, uhm. Yeah. But that's that's so. Odd. I mean, can you think of any other phrases that we can try? I could just, I don't know. What else can we try?\n00:01:26 Speaker 2\nWe sleep.\n00:01:31 Speaker 1\nYeah, alright. But that's something to definitely hold them that you know or maybe there is a way. Uh, in the settings that we could. You know, change something.\n00:01:46 Speaker 2\nI'll see.\n00:01:49 Speaker 5\nYeah, I was also sorry. Hi. Hi, Speaker 2. Hi I am Speaker 5. I know we don't have that many time, but I was thinking maybe because it's so generic and there's so many popular recipes, it's not gonna read you every single one because there can be like 30 50 possibly. Yeah, maybe break it down to like one of the most popular Italian recipes or Mexican.\n00:02:08 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah.\n00:02:10 Speaker 5\nAnd that way.\n00:02:11 Speaker 1\nOr maybe. Just say that maybe read me one popular recipe or something, you know, and then that way, like it might just give you one. But we can try that again when we come back in the breakout room to practice the the commands.\n00:02:30 Speaker 2\nSounds good, right?\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:02:30 Speaker 6\nYeah, only egg shot. No, no, I have no food allergy. No.\n00:02:33 Speaker 7\nOK. Thank you.\n00:02:42 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me one of the?\n00:02:43 Speaker 1\nWait, wait, wait.\n00:02:46 Speaker 2\nCan you read me one?\n00:02:47 Speaker 4\nOf the article lets you experience books.\n00:02:47 Speaker 1\nJust one second, Speaker 2.\n00:02:50 Speaker 4\nIn a whole new. Way to experience Audible, try asking for a specific book. \nSpeaker 1\nTell her to stop.\nSpeaker 4\nFor instance, you could ask them to read The Hobbit or the Grace Yahtzee from audible.\n00:02:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, stop. Hey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:03:21 Speaker 8\nAlright, I'm not sure why I'm having trouble sharing my screen.\n00:03:26 Speaker 2\nIt's sharing.\n00:03:28 Speaker 8\nOK. Can everyone see?\n00:03:31 Speaker 6\nYes, I can see, it says sharing by.\n00:03:32 Speaker 8\nOh, OK. Bye. Perfect. OK. Alrighty, OK. All right. So can everyone see the second screen because it says my screen is paused? No? You're still seeing my first this first screen.\n00:03:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, only says week five, yeah.\n00:03:58 Speaker 8\nInteresting. Not sure why that is.\n00:04:07 Speaker 3\nMe too.\n00:04:09 Speaker 8\nHmm, OK.\n00:04:25 Speaker 9\nSpeaker 8.\n00:04:27 Speaker 8\nYes. Sorry. Couldn't hear you. And then when I transition it says my screen is paused. You know this did happen to me last time too, and I don't really know how to. I'd like to think I'm technologically.\n00:05:02 Speaker 2\nAdvanced.\n00:05:03 Speaker 8\nYeah, but you know, situations like this happen where I'm like, maybe not so much.\n00:05:08 Speaker 1\nSometimes when you share the screen, if you look at the bottom. Before you share it, when you click share and it shows what you want, you select the window that you want to share the very bottom. There's something for the audio. Sometimes you have to. There could be something down there that you have to put. OK.\n00:05:31 Speaker 8\nAlrighty. Ohh, you know what I think you are. You're right. Fingers crossed. Let's see.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nYou got it.\n00:05:51 Speaker 8\nOK. Thank you. So. Much great.\n00:05:55 Speaker 6\nYeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n00:06:02 Speaker 8\nI know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it\u2019s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n00:07:21 Speaker 6\nYeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n00:07:36 Speaker 8\nI completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n00:09:18 Speaker 2\nHello.\n00:09:19 Speaker 8\nRight, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n00:09:23 Speaker 6\nUsing unmute don't hit hers.\n00:09:28 Speaker 2\nCan you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:39 Speaker 8\nSorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n00:09:44 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:09:49 Speaker 11\nFinding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:09:56 Speaker 8\nAwesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n00:10:29 Speaker 11\nFive cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n00:10:41 Speaker 8\nAll right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n00:11:21 Speaker 6\nOK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n00:11:37 Speaker 8\nSorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n00:11:57 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the directions?\n00:12:02 Speaker 11\nOK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n00:12:24 Speaker 8\nPerfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n00:12:57 Speaker 3\nSure.\n00:12:58 Speaker 8\nThe second, the second command.\n00:13:02 Speaker 1\nThat command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n00:13:18 Speaker 11\nStep 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:13:30 Speaker 1\nBut pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n00:13:33 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:13:43 Speaker 8\nShe never heard that.\n00:13:44 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, repeat.\n00:13:48 Speaker 8\nSorry, I think that was my fault.\n00:13:51 Speaker 2\nIt wasn't.\n00:13:58 Speaker 8\nGo ahead and ask it again.\n00:14:00 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:04 Speaker 8\nI think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n00:14:11 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 11, can you repeat?\n00:14:19 Speaker 8\nThis is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n00:14:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n00:14:31 Speaker 11\nStep 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n00:14:43 Speaker 8\nAll right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n00:15:23 Speaker 6\nSpeaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n00:15:29 Speaker 11\nTo make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n00:15:59 Speaker 8\nThat\u2019s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n00:16:09 Speaker 6\nYeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n00:16:17 Speaker 8\nYes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:18 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:17:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 3.\n00:17:23 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:18:32 Speaker 1\nUnmute. Right. It's right there.\n00:18:42 Speaker 2\nThanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n00:18:49 Speaker 2\nHe didn't hear you try again.\n00:18:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n00:19:01 Speaker 4\nThere are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n00:19:27 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nThere are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n00:20:05 Speaker 3\nHmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:26 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n00:20:33 Speaker 4\nFinding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n00:20:41 Speaker 3\nHmm.\n00:20:41 Speaker 1\nThey're all on the.\n00:20:43 Speaker 3\nThey're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n00:21:25 Speaker 5\nSo I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n00:21:28 Speaker 3\nYou do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n00:21:33 Speaker 5\nYeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n00:21:41 Speaker 2\nHey echo dot.\n00:21:43 Speaker 3\nSo you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n00:21:57 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n00:22:04 Speaker 4\nOK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n00:22:17 Speaker 3\nThat's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n00:22:38 Speaker 1\nI looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n00:22:45 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:47 Speaker 1\nMaybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n00:22:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n00:23:06 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:23:35 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nOK. What is it?\n00:23:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:45 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you.\n00:23:47 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n00:23:54 Speaker 4\nI've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n00:23:56 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:23:58 Speaker 3\nOK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n00:24:18 Speaker 4\nYou have two items on your shopping list.\n00:24:22 Speaker 3\nWhere are they?\n00:24:22 Speaker 4\nShampoo. Bananas.\n00:24:29 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n00:24:41 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n00:24:52 Speaker 4\nYou'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n00:24:55 Speaker 2\nYes, please. Yes please.\n00:24:59 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah.\n00:25:01 Speaker 2\nThanks. Yeah, she said done.\n00:25:05 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright.\n00:25:08 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:25:09 Speaker 3\nLet's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n00:25:43 Speaker 2\nOK, that's nice.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n00:26:17 Speaker 2\nExcuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n00:26:23 Speaker 1\nI\u2019ll just.\n00:26:25 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, no worries.\n00:26:34 Speaker 5\nSpeaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \nSpeaker 3\nYeah, yeah, go ahead. \nSpeaker 5\nOh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \nSpeaker 3\nThanks.\n00:26:51 Speaker 9\nAnd I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n00:27:13 Speaker 3\nI think so it would.\n00:27:14 Speaker 9\nYeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n00:27:19 Speaker 3\nYeah, I think so, yeah.\n00:27:22 Speaker 5\nYeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n00:27:40 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:27:42 Speaker 3\nOr maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n00:27:48 Speaker 5\nOhh yeah, that's true.\n00:27:50 Speaker 3\nLike you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nMartha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n00:28:51 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n00:29:19 Speaker 1\nGo ahead.\n00:29:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:26 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you?\n00:29:27 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, add gum to my shopping list.\n00:29:34 Speaker 4\nI added gum to your shopping list.\n00:29:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Perfect. And now do you want to say, check off gum?\n00:29:43 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nLouder, Speaker 2.\n00:29:51 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, check off gum.\n00:29:56 Speaker 4\nI've checked off gum from my shopping list.\n00:30:00 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. OK. All right, perfect. So when you have a longer list and you are done with only a few items, you can use that command. So your list gets shorter and you would know which ones are already done. OK.\n00:30:15 Speaker 2\nThat makes sense.\n00:30:16 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right. But good job, Speaker 2. You're doing so well.\n00:30:22 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:30:24 Speaker 3\nAll right, so let's see you we were earlier talking about food restrictions, dietary restrictions and substitutions, so. UM, let's say Speaker 2, you are having a friend over who needs gluten gluten free recipe. Do you wanna ask to find me a gluten free recipe for mac and cheese?\n00:30:52 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a gluten gluten free recipe for mac and cheese.\n00:31:01 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free mac and cheese recipes. OK for gluten free mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:31:09 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:31:11 Speaker 2\nGive me option one.\n00:31:13 Speaker 1\nYou have to.\n00:31:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option one.\n00:31:18 Speaker 1\nPowder.\n00:31:20 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:28 Speaker 3\nIs it not listening?\n00:31:28 Speaker 1\nNo. No, she had the blue when you said that.\n00:31:34 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option one?\n00:31:40 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:31:45 Speaker 3\nOK. Interesting. So I think without that audible you are not able to get them to read it. That's so odd though. I mean, it's on there, but. OK.\n00:32:01 Speaker 1\nAudible? Like for books. That's what I.\n00:32:05 Speaker 3\nThought yes, that's that's the one. But I don't know why it would that would be connected. I am not sure about that. Yeah.\n00:32:18 Speaker 1\nTo read the option two.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me option 2.\n00:32:25 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:32:26 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:32:34 Speaker 4\nAccording to Ashley is a brand name drug whose generic name is.\n00:32:38 Speaker 3\nIt's going to like the meaning of option it seems like. That's so odd. OK. Is it? Is it on? That is the are the recipes on on there on the screen?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThey were just. I'll go off this one. OK, now that.\n00:32:59 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me option 2?\n00:33:05 Speaker 4\nTo get this title, go to audible.com.\n00:33:08 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. That's odd. Maybe like maybe try read me option one of the gluten free recipes on the screen or something, just just something that you can try. I don't know if it would work.\n00:33:27 Speaker 10\nSorry, I don't mean to.\n00:33:29 Speaker 3\nYeah, go ahead, Speaker 10.\n00:33:32 Speaker 10\nMaybe try saying. Oh, did that work? Audible.com OK, maybe try saying the like mentioning the word recipe because I'm saying option 2 Speaker 4 is automatically going to default to what it thinks it's saying because you know it's not going to remember that he was looking at recipes. So maybe try changing the command to. Oh. Hey Speaker 4, read me the next recipe like the Echo prompted him to do before.\n00:34:03 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:08 Speaker 1\nLouder.\n00:34:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:13 Speaker 1\nShe's not turning on. She's not hearing them try again.\n00:34:17 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the next recipe?\n00:34:22 Speaker 1\nIt's not working. No, that's.\n00:34:26 Speaker 10\nI think you go back to the net, the you need to say the recipe command again. So for example looking for a recipe for Mac and cheese and then when it shows you the options you're going to say the next command. Hey, Speaker 4, can you show me the next recipe for? Mac and cheese.\n00:34:46 Speaker 3\nSo let's say Speaker 2, let's, let's again. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n00:34:51 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4 heard you there, but.\n00:34:53 Speaker 10\nNo, yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nOK. So start again Speaker 2.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me the? Next recipe of gluten free Mac and cheese recipe.\n00:35:09 Speaker 1\nSo start from the.\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:18 Speaker 1\nSay it louder.\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, Speaker 4, can you read me a gluten free Mac and cheese recipe?\n00:35:27 Speaker 4\nFinding some gluten free Mac and cheese recipes OK for gluten free Mac and cheese. Here's a few recipes.\n00:35:35 Speaker 2\nCan you read them? Hey Speaker 4, can you read them to me?\n00:35:46 Speaker 4\nAudible lets you experience books in a whole new way.\n00:35:49 Speaker 3\nI don't know. That's so odd that would let it would read out on the on on the on the device which does not have the screen and it would not read out with like you know a device that has the screen, but we'll have to figure something out about it. But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nOK. Hey, Speaker 4, find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:45 Speaker 1\nSay it again. She's not hearing.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, to find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:36:50 Speaker 1\nSay her name. Pause for a second and then go because she's not picking up what you're talking to her. Try again.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nI will. Hey, Speaker 4. Find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n00:37:05 Speaker 4\nYou can substitute 1 cup of coconut milk with one cup of milk.\n00:37:10 Speaker 3\nOK, so like a whole milk you can substitute it with. So. That can definitely be used when you know there is a recipe, like maybe a Thai Curry recipe or something that you know you were that is making and what can be used and that would be interesting for you. To know right? OK. All right. OK, Speaker 2, how about a vegan or vegetarian recipe for? Let's let's do something other than Mac and cheese. Do you want to know any vegan or vegetarian recipe for something?\n00:37:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's the vegan vegetarian recipe?\n00:38:00 Speaker 4\nFinding some vegan vegetarian recipes OK for vegan vegetarian. Here\u2019s a few recipes.\n00:38:09 Speaker 3\nOK, it's that's going to happen again. Like it's going to give you these options and where you can't pick.\n00:38:09 Speaker 1\nYes. What about a a vegetarian pizza? OK.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's a vegetarian pizza made out of? \nSpeaker 1\nTry again.\nSpeaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. What's a vegetarian pizza made out of?\n00:38:36 Speaker 4\nVegetarian pizza typically contains ranch dressing, salt, Italian seasoning, all-purpose flour, zucchini, sour cream, sugar, sweet onion, corn, bean cream cheese, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, kosher salt, parmesan yeast, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil, squash. And olive oil.\n00:38:56 Speaker 1\nTell her to read you read the next reader recipe.\n00:39:00 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read a recipe for the next one.\n00:39:09 Speaker 1\nWindow read all of that stuff and to the right it said recipes. So you'd have to click on it for the recipes.\n00:39:18 Speaker 3\nRight, right. Yeah, that's I think for something like this, it would just make more sense for him to not have the screen. I mean, it would be. More powerful for him, and he would succeed much more, I guess, to not have that. Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food? So maybe do you want to say how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie? You're going to try that?\n00:40:10 Speaker 2\nRight. Hey, Speaker 4, how many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:24 Speaker 3\nDid it hear?\n00:40:27 Speaker 2\nYes it did. She's blue lines going. Try again.\n00:40:32 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. Did you hear what I just said?\n00:40:38 Speaker 2\nTry again. So again.\n00:40:43 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sugar in a chocolate chip cookie?\n00:40:58 Speaker 4\nOne chocolate chip cookie has 5.3 grams of sugar.\nSpeaker 2\nThanks.\n00:41:02 Speaker 3\nOK, there you go. Alright, let's ask one more question is in cheese crackers or anything else that you wanna pick, Speaker 2?\n00:41:27 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, how many grams of sugar are in a peanut butter cookie?\n00:41:36 Speaker 4\nOne ounce of peanut butter cookie has 8.1 grams of sugar.\n00:41:45 Speaker 1\nAlright. Do you want to try a question about how much sodium is in a particular food item that you would want to ask the sodium content, Speaker 2, maybe in like crackers like cheese crackers or Ritz crackers or something.\n00:42:09 Speaker 3\nI will, OK. Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers? Hey, Speaker 4. How many grams of sodium are in Ritz crackers?\n00:42:37 Speaker 4\nOne whole whole wheat Ritz crackers has 26.5 milligrams of sodium. One Nabisco Ritzs original cracker has 29.1 milligrams of sodium.\n00:42:51 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:42:52 Speaker 1\nThere's a, I googled and it said voice view for the echo.\n00:42:59 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:42:59 Speaker 1\nThe settings.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nVoice view.\n00:43:03 Speaker 1\nYes, I don't know.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK. I I can definitely look it up and send it back some some information. Back to you if. There, if, if it's something that can be. You know, done in the settings or I don't know if you need another app or something on your Speaker 4 or you know syncs to your Speaker 4. But let me find some things out and I can I can help with that. All right, Speaker 2. What's that?\n00:43:37 Speaker 1\nThank you.\n00:43:38 Speaker 3\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. Right. So let's see, finding number of calories for a certain type of food. So how many calories are in whatever food item that you want to find calories for?\n00:43:55 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, how many calories are in my acne.\n00:44:04 Speaker 4\nFrom webmd.com. There are 120 calories and 13 grams of fat in one tablespoon.\n00:44:14 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. OK. So I guess we are done. Let me see.\n00:44:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, we should be.\n00:44:29 Speaker 3\nYep, we are.\n00:44:30 Speaker 9\nLike quite a good sense of time. You have a very good biological clock.\n00:44:34 Speaker 3\nI think so. I know. And you worked so hard today it's. I mean it was. It was really hard. I I totally get it. But we'll figure this out. I think like knowing the recipes is so important to you. So we definitely want to figure out what's the best way for you to get the information that you need and not having to not having to rely on someone to you know tap on those options for you. So. Yeah, but we'll figure that out, but.\n00:45:07 Speaker 1\nI added the word for a blind person or for blind, and I think that's how I got the voice view.\n00:45:16 Speaker 9\nOK. Interesting. \n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nSpeaker 9\nHi everyone. We are back. I just want to say a big shout out. It's just always lovely to see Speaker 6 sharing her science knowledge. You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n00:45:40 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:45:48 Speaker 9\nAnd now you project your voice so well and it transfers over to like the clinician side. I think we're all seeing it. I see actually 5 people nodding. Just want to tell you that we see a lot of improvement and you've been trying so hard. Very resist. Yeah, very resilient. To all the challenges with Speaker 4, so I just want to make a quick announcement next week is our last week of the program.\n00:46:17 Speaker 6\nAlright.\n00:46:19 Speaker 9\nYeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n00:47:28 Speaker 6\nNo, but maybe you can give us homework later. So for next week's last session e-mail  it to us later, OK.\n00:47:37 Speaker 9\nYeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n00:48:26 Speaker 6\nBye. \nSpeaker 9\nBye, Speaker 6. Bye, Speaker 2. OK, let's stop the recording. I just want to say, like within ourselves, a big shout out to Speaker 13. Really good job moderating and sorry or like leading a lot of these individual sessions. I also see a big improvement from Week 1 to the last week and., \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Date: 08-15-2024\n- Clinician: Not specified\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Difficulty using the Alexa device to read recipes and manage a shopping list.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):** \nM.A. is experiencing challenges with the Alexa device, particularly in retrieving and reading recipes. The caregiver and M.A. discussed various commands to improve the interaction with the device, including specific phrases to elicit better responses.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and better align the language model's output with the objective function, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Emphasize Broader ADL-Related Tasks**: The system prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to focus on a wider range of activities of daily living (ADLs) beyond just recipe and shopping list management. This can be achieved by including examples of other ADL-related tasks, such as setting timers, playing music, or managing reminders, to ensure the generated SOAP note reflects a comprehensive view of the patient's functional activities.\n\n2. **Incorporate Motivational Assessment**: The prompt should guide the LLM to assess and document the patient's motivation and readiness to engage with the device. This can be done by including a directive to evaluate the patient's enthusiasm, willingness to learn, and any motivational factors that influence their interaction with the device.\n\n3. **Include Performance Metrics**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to incorporate quantitative performance metrics in the SOAP note. This could involve specifying the need to track success rates, frequency of successful interactions, or any measurable improvements in device usage, which would provide a more detailed and objective assessment of the patient's progress.\n\n4. **Set Specific Goals and Strategies**: The prompt should encourage the LLM to outline specific, measurable goals and strategies for the patient's use of the device. This could include setting target success rates for voice command accuracy or developing a step-by-step plan to improve device interaction, ensuring the SOAP note provides clear objectives for the patient's development.\n\n5. **Highlight Homework and Metacognitive Strategies**: The prompt should guide the LLM to include a section on homework assignments and metacognitive strategies. This could involve encouraging the patient to reflect on their device usage, identify areas for improvement, and engage in self-directed learning to enhance their skills.\n\n6. **Ensure Consistency and Detail**: The prompt should emphasize the importance of maintaining consistency in structure and detail across all sections of the SOAP note. This includes providing comprehensive information in each section (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and ensuring the level of detail mirrors that of the target note.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into the system prompt, the LLM can generate a SOAP note that more closely aligns with the target note, thereby improving the response's accuracy and relevance to the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n08-01-2024 M.A. User needs assessment + Breakout room training.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Clinician\nSpeaker 2: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient F.W.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Clinician\nSpeaker 9: Clinician\nSpeaker 10: Patient L.V.G.\n\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nRecording. So we're gonna go over some questions related to self-care and medical needs today. So first of all, though, we're going to do a little review of the last week's comments. So you're going to show me how you can play music, play music, or a video of your choice with your Speaker 4 device. So you want to go ahead and do that? Speaker 2, do you want to give it a command?\n00:00:37 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you play? A video from. January 3rd. OK.\n00:00:56 Speaker 1\nDoes it? Is it playing anything?\n00:00:58 Speaker 3\nYes it is.\n00:01:00 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:01:00 Speaker 3\nI hooked up Speaker 2's apple music. To the elect. Don't ask me how I did it, but. I figured it out. OK. We did hook it up and he's been able. He's been using that feature a lot, he'll say, play Bon Jovi or and it will just start playing a. Yeah. Bunch of Bon Jovi songs.\n00:01:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect. OK. So when?\n00:01:27 Speaker 3\nBut I do have a question.\n00:01:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, go ahead. Yeah.\n00:01:31 Speaker 3\nThat just turn it off, Speaker 2.\n00:01:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:38 Speaker 3\nLouder.\n00:01:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:01:42 Speaker 3\nIt's muted. That's fine.\n00:01:43 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Stop.\n00:01:48 Speaker 3\nIn in relation to the music, Speaker 2 listens to a radio station in the mornings. It's a KC 790.\n00:01:50 Speaker 1\nUh-huh.\n00:01:59 Speaker 3\nSo is there a way to hook that up as well?\n00:02:04 Speaker 1\nThere should be actually.\n00:02:08 Speaker 3\nAnd if not, I believe the show he listens to is on that iheart app. So I don't, I do, we don't have that either, but I those are that was part part one and we could hook it up then it would be the same way. Part 2 is Speaker 2 gets books from. Guard. Which is for from Berlin Institute their books. It's a reading library and you choose your books on Bard and then you can play. Listen to your books. Is it possible to hook that up to Speaker 4 or should it just be YouTube? On YouTube you can actually listen to all kinds of stories as well.\n00:02:51 Speaker 1\nRight, so I'm pretty. Sure that the audible, I I don't know if you know there's a there's a website called Audible which has audible books. I'm pretty sure that can be hooked up to Speaker 4. I am not very sure about about the board. OK. But I can check and let you know about that one. Yeah, I I can research a little bit and maybe maybe get back to you is it called Bard Bard.\n00:03:15 Speaker 3\nOhh OK. Correct. OK. It's rail institute.\n00:03:25 Speaker 1\nAll right. OK, alright, let me check I I almost wonder if if it could be. Synced into your phone. And because your phones Speaker 4 is synced in with the Speaker 4 on the Echo. So if it could be played on the phone, it could be played on here, but I will check and let.\n00:03:44 Speaker 4\nUh-huh.\n00:03:51 Speaker 1\nYou know for sure.\n00:03:52 Speaker 3\nOK. And just so you know, I put the Bard app is on his iPad and I put the Speaker 4 app on the iPad.\n00:03:58 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So.\n00:04:00 Speaker 3\nAnd they're both and. The pad is linked to the.\n00:04:02 Speaker 1\nPhone, phone. Perfect. So, alright. OK. I can. I can look that up for sure. One was the Bard and then other one was the.\n00:04:10 Speaker 2\nOh.\n00:04:11 Speaker 1\nMusic. You said. No. What? What was that?\n00:04:13 Speaker 3\nAt the radio station, it's OK.\n00:04:15 Speaker 1\nRadio station about yes.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nAt K ABC 790 OK Yeah 790.\n00:04:19 Speaker 4\nABC.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAll right. So all right, those are very specific questions, so.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nI didn't. Well, we're we're trying.\n00:04:30 Speaker 1\nYeah, no, that's perfect. But so Speaker 2, I had a question. So when you said Speaker 4 play a video from January 3rd, what did it bring up? Did it, was it anything specific that what what did was that the command that he that you gave?\n00:04:48 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what command did you give?\n00:04:51 Speaker 2\nJust command.\n00:04:53 Speaker 3\nCan you repeat it? Yeah. What was it?\n00:04:57 Speaker 2\nYou like to play. New memory from January 3rd.\n00:05:03 Speaker 3\nA memory from January.\n00:05:04 Speaker 1\n3rd memory OK, play a memory from OK. So did it. What did it bring up? I'm just curious.\n00:05:14 Speaker 3\nIt did. It was a video and then the music started playing.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nFor you.\n00:05:20 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK. All right, but. Very nice, Speaker 2. I mean, I'm, I'm so impressed. All right, so.\n00:05:31 Speaker 4\nThat for you.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:05:34 Speaker 1\nAll right, perfect. All right, Speaker 2. So let's move over to this week's topic. What type? So I have a few questions I want to ask you. First, initially to 1st ASK is is like what is your goal when it comes to self-care and medical needs? Using Speaker 4, what would you say your goal is?\n00:06:02 Speaker 3\nFor health and medical needs, Speaker 2 to use Speaker 4.\n00:06:04 Speaker 2\nHow's the mass on each? Here. Brushing my teeth.\n00:06:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright. What did you what? What else did you say?\n00:06:23 Speaker 3\nTrimming his nails.\n00:06:25 Speaker 1\nOK, trimming the nails. Perfect. Alright. Anything else you can think of?\n00:06:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, eating breakfast.\n00:06:36 Speaker 1\nCorrect. So eating meals on time?\n00:06:39 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:06:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n00:07:07 Speaker 3\nAre you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:07:16 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n00:07:40 Speaker 2\nMy iPhone.\n00:07:42 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n00:07:56 Speaker 3\nAre you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n00:08:00 Speaker 2\nMaking reminders on the iPhone.\n00:08:04 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:08:06 Speaker 1\nSo OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n00:08:50 Speaker 3\nIf I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n00:09:06 Speaker 1\nGot it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n00:10:11 Speaker 2\nSo I can. Make goals.\n00:10:17 Speaker 3\nMake goals.\n00:10:18 Speaker 2\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nAnd complete them.\n00:10:21 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n00:11:00 Speaker 3\nWould you like her to remind you?\n00:11:04 Speaker 3\nTo eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n00:11:12 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:11:15 Speaker 3\nOK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nBrushing my teeth.\n00:11:37 Speaker 3\nBrushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n00:11:40 Speaker 1\nAll right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n00:12:13 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n00:12:27 Speaker 1\nYours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n00:12:48 Speaker 3\nThe same right? And that makes like more.\n00:12:49 Speaker 1\nYou think of that, Speaker 2?\n00:12:52 Speaker 2\nThat's a good idea.\n00:12:53 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n00:13:59 Speaker 3\nFair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n00:14:13 Speaker 4\nMHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nThat'd be good. OK.\n00:14:21 Speaker 3\nBecause I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n00:14:31 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:14:31 Speaker 3\nWould be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n00:14:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n00:14:54 Speaker 3\nOK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n00:15:09 Speaker 1\nUh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n00:15:12 Speaker 3\nA barred book is what I'm thinking.\n00:15:15 Speaker 1\nYeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n00:15:25 Speaker 3\nOh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n00:15:42 Speaker 1\nYou know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n00:16:19 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n00:16:21 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n00:16:40 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:16:42 Speaker 1\nI almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n00:16:46 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:16:47 Speaker 1\nThe device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n00:16:50 Speaker 3\nMm-hmm.\n00:17:08 Speaker 1\nBecause there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n00:17:19 Speaker 3\nWell, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n00:17:26 Speaker 1\nThat's all.\n00:17:31 Speaker 3\nFeel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n00:17:35 Speaker 1\nThat would be great.\n00:17:35 Speaker 3\nCould behind.\n00:17:38 Speaker 1\nThat would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n00:17:44 Speaker 3\nOK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n00:17:52 Speaker 1\nOhh OK Speaker 2.\n00:17:57 Speaker 3\nThey were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n00:18:05 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:18:08 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:18:08 Speaker 2\nStop.\n00:18:11 Speaker 3\nThere. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n00:18:15 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:18:16 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n00:18:41 Speaker 1\nYeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n00:18:49 Speaker 3\nBut an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n00:18:53 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:18:55 Speaker 3\nDo I just say to open the bar app?\n00:18:59 Speaker 1\nYeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n00:19:03 Speaker 3\nOK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n00:19:25 Speaker 1\nNo, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n00:19:57 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n00:20:01 Speaker 4\nSearching for the.\n00:20:04 Speaker 3\nBard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n00:20:12 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:20:14 Speaker 4\nCouncil.\n00:20:15 Speaker 1\nIs there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n00:21:05 Speaker 4\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n00:21:08 Speaker 3\nOK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n00:21:18 Speaker 4\nSearching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n00:21:19 Speaker 3\nIt's not understanding the bars.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nThat's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n00:21:26 Speaker 3\nMaybe yeah.\n00:21:29 Speaker 1\nAnother another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n00:21:59 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:02 Speaker 1\nTo.\n00:22:04 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n00:22:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n00:22:25 Speaker 3\nNope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nIs Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n00:22:46 Speaker 3\nNo, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n00:22:50 Speaker 1\nIt's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n00:22:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nIt's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n00:23:15 Speaker 3\nI'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n00:23:29 Speaker 1\nYeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n00:23:44 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n00:23:48 Speaker 4\nMy.\n00:23:52 Speaker 1\nAlright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n00:24:20 Speaker 2\nYep.\n00:24:21 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n00:24:46 Speaker 3\nThe breakout room.\n00:24:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:24:48 Speaker 3\nOK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n00:24:51 Speaker 1\nAbsolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nOK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- \nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:55 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 2.\n00:25:10 Speaker 2\nHey, what's up?\n00:25:12 Speaker 1\nAlright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n00:25:50 Speaker 3\nUnmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n00:26:07 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:26:11 Speaker 3\nOK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n00:26:12 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Could.\n00:26:21 Speaker 1\nOK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:28 Speaker 2\nOK. Thank you.\n00:26:30 Speaker 3\nGo ahead.\n00:26:31 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n00:26:44 Speaker 4\nI've checked off oranges from medication.\n00:26:47 Speaker 2\nThanks.\n00:26:49 Speaker 1\nOhh did it say check off?\n00:26:49 Speaker 3\nAnd. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n00:26:55 Speaker 1\nNo longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n00:27:25 Speaker 2\nIbuprofen.\n00:27:27 Speaker 1\nOK, well you have been.\n00:27:28 Speaker 3\nWhat's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n00:27:38 Speaker 2\nTypical.\n00:27:39 Speaker 3\nOK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n00:27:42 Speaker 2\nEvery day.\n00:27:43 Speaker 3\nAt what time? In the morning it's at.\n00:27:53 Speaker 2\n7:30.\n00:27:55 Speaker 3\nOK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n00:28:00 Speaker 1\nOK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n00:28:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n00:28:14 Speaker 1\nOK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n00:28:22 Speaker 3\n10.\n00:28:23 Speaker 1\n7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to take Depakote at 7:30 AM tomorrow.\n00:28:42 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n00:28:47 Speaker 1\nOK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n00:29:09 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:29:10 Speaker 1\nOK, let's do that command.\n00:29:15 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n00:29:31 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n00:29:36 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n00:30:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n00:30:29 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. CVS Pharmacy 0.8 miles away on Canyon Way, right? A 1.4 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite 110, Walgreens 2.3 miles away on Haven Ave. you can ask me for things like what's the phone number for the first one?\n00:30:51 Speaker 1\nOK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n00:31:04 Speaker 3\nIf that makes sense.\n00:31:07 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n00:31:49 Speaker 3\nJust so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nRight, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n00:32:08 Speaker 3\nJust so you. You had a heads up and. So you you know what?\n00:32:13 Speaker 1\nI mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n00:32:45 Speaker 3\nHe didn't.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I do my laundry?\n00:32:59 Speaker 1\nDid it pick it up?\n00:33:01 Speaker 3\nIt it's showing it's. A video and pictures and a lot of words on how to do it. Let me just make sure the volumes up, yeah, the volumes 3/4.\n00:33:14 Speaker 1\nOh, OK.\n00:33:16 Speaker 3\nIt picked it up but it. I don't know if my cord. Will reach the camera.\n00:33:23 Speaker 1\nOK. Is it is it more visual? Maybe like rather than ohh it's like a very text. It's all.\n00:33:30 Speaker 3\nIt's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n00:33:36 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n00:33:59 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Give me the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:12 Speaker 3\nIt's doing the same thing, the same thing. Try tell me how to do laundry that way you're telling her to? Read it to. You.\n00:34:21 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:34:22 Speaker 3\nSorry again, Speaker 2.\n00:34:25 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Hey, Speaker 4. Tell me how to do my laundry. One step at a time.\n00:34:40 Speaker 3\nIt's written again. It's written again. OK, OK, directions. Speaker 2.\n00:34:50 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, read me the directions to do my laundry.\n00:34:58 Speaker 4\nAt the moment, traffic to vineyards marketplace cleaners at 11460 Canyon Way looks pretty clear.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nOhh it's giving like.\n00:35:05 Speaker 4\nJust about 3 minutes via Canyon with her place.\n00:35:09 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's a.\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nYeah. It's like a laundromat. Probably gets. Right. OK, alright. Alright, let's try another one. OK, let's try this set reminder to do laundry. Maybe that's a function more functional one. I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n00:35:54 Speaker 2\nM. OK.\n00:35:57 Speaker 3\nGo.\n00:35:58 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Remind me to. Do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:05 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:36:07 Speaker 2\nTo do my laundry tomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:11 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:36:12 Speaker 2\nTomorrow at 5:00.\n00:36:20 Speaker 4\nIs that 5:00? In the morning or in the afternoon.\n00:36:22 Speaker 2\nIn the afternoon.\n00:36:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 5:00 PM.\n00:36:32 Speaker 1\nBye. Purpose. OK, good job. Does these kind of reminders help Speaker 2? Maybe. That would be more functional in the real life, you think.\n00:36:46 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 1\nAlright, yeah.\n00:36:49 Speaker 3\nI think so. When I asked Speaker 2, I was cooking and I asked him to set the timer for me and that was very optional. Yes.\n00:36:57 Speaker 1\nYeah. Yeah, that is great.\n00:37:01 Speaker 3\nAnd she even told. Speaker 4, to set my mom at the time.\n00:37:06 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah. So. OK. OK. All right, so getting stains out of clothes. What else?\n00:37:19 Speaker 3\nOK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n00:37:21 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n00:37:38 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:37:44 Speaker 3\nWhat?\n00:37:44 Speaker 2\nWhat do I use to get a stain out of my clothes?\n00:37:52 Speaker 4\nTo remove stains from clothes, rinse the stain with cold water and scrub it with the brush and soap. If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in cold water and soak for an hour. Then wash the clothing as usual.\n00:38:06 Speaker 3\nThis one showed the words in paragraph as well as Reddit.\n00:38:11 Speaker 1\nThat's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n00:38:18 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:38:37 Speaker 1\nText. But. I almost wonder for the laundry part. If we'd ask her to give me the first step to do my laundry or something like that.\n00:38:51 Speaker 3\nYeah. Try that, Speaker 2.\n00:38:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you give me the first step to do my laundry?\n00:39:06 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:39:08 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n00:39:41 Speaker 1\nWow.\n00:39:41 Speaker 3\nI think that was the paragraph that she didn't read before.\n00:39:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, but it read. It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n00:40:20 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:40:24 Speaker 1\nDo you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n00:40:48 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. When do I use the fabric softener?\n00:40:57 Speaker 4\nAccording to an Speaker 4 Answers contributor. Add fabric softener to the wash during the rinse cycle.\n00:41:05 Speaker 1\nOK. All right.\n00:41:08 Speaker 3\nMakes sense?\n00:41:09 Speaker 1\nOK, I think this is pretty functional here. So Speaker 2 say that you have a headache and you need some answers on how to treat it on your own. So you're going to say the wake word and say, how do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:32 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. How do I treat a migraine?\n00:41:42 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for a migraine include applying ice packs to the back of the neck, forehead or temples, taking a nap, taking a warm shower or bath, massage, drinking water resting in a low lit room, or physical therapy.\n00:42:00 Speaker 1\nOK, that's perfect. OK. All right, let's do the same for stomach pains. OK, so say you have a sudden stomach pain and you want to know what remedies you can use. So you're going to say the wake word. And what do I take for stomach pains? Ready. Cool.\n00:42:27 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:35 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:42:38 Speaker 4\nHuh.\n00:42:40 Speaker 1\nInteresting. Let me try that one more time, OK. On mine, Speaker 4, mute. What do I take for stomach pains?\n00:42:55 Speaker 4\nI don't know that one.\n00:42:58 Speaker 1\nIt says the same thing for me too.\n00:43:01 Speaker 3\nOh wow.\n00:43:02 Speaker 1\nYeah. So we'll have to try that one one more time.\n00:43:08 Speaker 3\nYeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n00:43:14 Speaker 1\nOK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n00:43:26 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:43:27 Speaker 1\nUh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:09 Speaker 3\nWhat kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, find me a physical therapy doctor.\n00:44:20 Speaker 4\nI found a few options for that. All Star physical therapy 3.1 miles away on Rochester Ave. Suite 110, team Physical therapy, 3 miles away on Town Center. Dr. Rancho San Antonio Rehab Center, 2.3 miles away on Milliken Ave. Suite G30.\n00:44:41 Speaker 1\nOK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n00:45:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's.\n00:45:21 Speaker 2\nYeah it does.\n00:45:24 Speaker 1\nOK, I think we are through with the slides. Let me stop sharing my screen. OK. Any questions about anything we did today?\n00:45:37 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:45:38 Speaker 1\nNo. OK, how about you?\n00:45:40 Speaker 3\nMom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n00:45:51 Speaker 4\nHmm.\n00:45:53 Speaker 3\nI'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n00:45:56 Speaker 1\nYeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n00:46:46 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:46:49 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:46:49 Speaker 3\nYou know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n00:46:55 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:47:01 Speaker 3\nDo you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n00:47:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n00:47:40 Speaker 3\nSo I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n00:47:56 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:47:58 Speaker 4\nYou.\n00:47:59 Speaker 4\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n00:48:01 Speaker 1\nYeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n00:48:01 Speaker 3\nAnd it was.\n00:48:20 Speaker 1\nBecause once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n00:48:33 Speaker 3\nRight. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n00:48:55 Speaker 1\nYes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n00:50:15 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:50:16 Speaker 1\nError. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n00:50:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n00:50:32 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:50:33 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:50:35 Speaker 1\nYeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n00:50:44 Speaker 3\nOhh no, I think we're good, thank.\n00:50:45 Speaker 1\nYou OK? Alright. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and I. Hey. Will get back to you, OK.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:50:57 Speaker 4\nI hope you had a great session today. And I will be oh. I have a few more people here. OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slide a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems. So expect another homework for this week, self-care inform. Just just to double check that you all submitted your homework for week 1 and week two, you got all the slides. I know, Speaker 6, you got it, Speaker 2, you got it. OK, Speaker 10, you got it too. Yeah. I need to do mine.\n00:51:40 Speaker 10\nCan I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n00:51:49 Speaker 4\nYeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Speaker 9, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our part point training. So after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be anytime. But if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd, the so think week six. If you go by numbers in. Your head.\n00:52:41 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:52:42 Speaker 4\nWeek 6 we would like to hear from you. Just we were asking some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well, you can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share. Together, because chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel, feel free to bring them as well. And I'll send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n00:53:31 Speaker 6\nOK.\n00:53:33 Speaker 4\nAny questions?\n00:53:34 Speaker 5\nSorry. Speaker 6, we we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 6, if you still want to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and. Then we'll let. You go, I promise. Sounds good. OK. OK.\n00:53:47 Speaker 4\nAnd and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can debrief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday.\n00:54:04 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:54:07 Speaker 4\nAll right, Speaker 6, I'm going to open the breakout room. OK. Uh, you all don't have to go because only Speaker 6 and Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 can go. And don't forget to record. OK.\n00:54:21 Speaker 2\nYou want me to join or not?\n00:54:23 Speaker 4\nYes, Speaker 6, you're going to go ahead and join. We're going. To change the wake up word for you. OK. Here we go. OK, let's stop recording. Thanks so much, Gina.\n00:54:44 Speaker 4\nYay, great job.\n00:54:47 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:54:48 Speaker 5\nDid you see?\n00:54:48 Speaker 4\nThe stop recording or who is recording now just telling. Oh yeah, there it is. OK. Oh my goodness. You did. It's amazing job. Gina, I just love how you provided so many solutions on the spot. I was like, this is how a well versed trainer who knows her system can do because there were some of those. I'm like, well, you know. What I don't know, he can do. Like like I can do it. So I was literally like, I'm learning from Tina because I haven't explored. Those. List function. It's super helpful.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Date: 08-01-2024\n- Clinician: [Clinician's Name]\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is seeking assistance with self-care and medical needs, specifically regarding the use of technology (Alexa) to manage daily tasks.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old individual who is currently utilizing an Alexa device (referred to as Speaker 4) to assist with daily activities. The patient\u2019s caregiver reports that M.A. has been using the device to play music and videos, set reminders for medications, and manage self-care tasks such as brushing teeth and trimming nails. The patient expresses a desire to improve independence in managing these tasks.\n\n**Goals for Self-Care:**\n- Use technology to remember daily self-care tasks (e.g., brushing teeth, trimming nails, eating meals on time).\n- Set reminders for medication intake (currently taking medications twice daily).\n- Explore additional functionalities of the Alexa device to assist with self-care and medical needs.\n\n**Current Medications:**\n- Depakote (dosage and frequency not specified, but taken twice daily).\n\n**Social History:**\n- M.A. is supported by a caregiver who assists with technology and daily tasks.\n- The patient has access to an iPhone and an iPad, which are used to set reminders and manage tasks.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**\n- No acute symptoms reported; focus is on technology use for self-care management.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Physical Exam Findings:**\n- Not assessed during this session.\n\n**Technology Assessment:**\n- M.A. successfully used the Alexa device to play music and videos.\n- Caregiver reports that M.A. has set reminders for medications on the iPhone.\n- Discussion about integrating additional functionalities of the Alexa device for reminders related to self-care tasks.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem 1: Difficulty in managing self-care tasks independently.**\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Lack of familiarity with technology.\n     - Need for structured reminders for daily tasks.\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. is currently reliant on caregivers for reminders and assistance with self-care tasks.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and better align it with the objective function, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Emphasize Contextual Relevance**: The system prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to focus on the specific context of meal preparation and the use of Alexa for cooking-related tasks. This can be achieved by including a directive to prioritize information related to dietary management, cooking scenarios, and the integration of technology in these tasks.\n\n2. **Incorporate Specific Scenarios**: The prompt should guide the LLM to extract and emphasize specific scenarios from the conversation that involve the use of Alexa for meal preparation. This includes setting timers, finding recipes, and managing dietary restrictions. By highlighting these scenarios, the LLM can generate a more relevant and detailed SOAP note.\n\n3. **Highlight Technology Use**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to conduct a detailed assessment of technology use, particularly focusing on how Alexa is utilized during cooking tasks. This includes describing interactions, challenges faced due to blindness, and the effectiveness of Alexa commands in assisting with meal preparation.\n\n4. **Focus on Accessibility and Training**: The prompt should direct the LLM to consider the need for accessibility modifications and training in the use of Alexa for meal preparation. This involves outlining specific tasks and commands practiced, as well as potential use of devices like the Echo Dot for better verbal output.\n\n5. **Consistency in Terminology and Structure**: The prompt should ensure that the LLM uses consistent terminology and structure that aligns with the target SOAP note. This includes using similar headings, subheadings, and language to maintain coherence and clarity.\n\n6. **Encourage Detailed Planning**: The prompt should encourage the LLM to develop a comprehensive plan section that addresses meal preparation and Alexa training. This involves outlining specific tasks, commands, and a home exercise program related to cooking.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into the system prompt, the LLM can be guided to produce a SOAP note that is more aligned with the target focus, includes specific details, and enhances the overall quality and relevance of the generated content.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

Did we do the homework? \n00:00:03 Speaker 2\nYes. \n00:00:04 Speaker 1\nYes, we did.\n00:00:06 Speaker 3\nOK. And how did it go? What do you? Is there something that was hard or easy? Tell me about it.\n00:00:09 Speaker 2\nGood. It was easy.\n00:00:16 Speaker 3\nIt was easy. OK, So what are the commands that you that you were that you did?\n00:00:25 Speaker 1\nThe homework for this past week, Speaker 2 was about medication. Did you remember what we added?\n00:00:31 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:00:32 Speaker 1\nWhat was it? Do you wanna tell Speaker 4 or do you wanna mute Speaker 4?\n00:00:39 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you tell me what the?\n00:00:47 Speaker 4\nI missed something. Can you say it again?\n00:00:49 Speaker 2\nCan you tell me what the?\n00:00:53 Speaker 4\nSorry I don't have an answer for that.\n00:00:58 Speaker 1\nDo you remember the homework that we did?\n00:01:01 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, do you remember the homework that we did last week?\n00:01:06 Speaker 4\nI didn't find any notes about remember the homework path.\n00:01:11 Speaker 1\nDo you remember what you and I were sitting on the couch, Speaker 2, when we did it and we had to record it a few times because we kept making mistakes. So what was the thing that we were doing? It was the. There was one word that you had to keep remembering to say. That was a hard word to remember to say. Remember, Daily, Speaker 2 kept saying can you add whatever. Tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, it was a reminder for to to take medicine at 8:00 tomorrow. And then he would add the word daily. So that's why we kept recording recording this. But he eventually got it where he forgot the word, didn't use the word tomorrow and just use the word daily. And then it worked perfectly.\n00:01:52 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, alright, that's good.\n00:02:09 Speaker 1\nUnder that and we added something to your list.\n00:02:13 Speaker 2\nMy medicines.\n00:02:14 Speaker 1\nThat's right. Do you remember what we added? You thought of it? It was for a cop.\n00:02:23 Speaker 2\nHoffman.\n00:02:24 Speaker 1\nIt was a type of cough medicine. You decided to add on the Robitussin, wasn't it? Yeah.\n00:02:26\nOh.\n00:02:27 Speaker 3\nOK. OK, perfect. OK. All right. So let's see. So we're going to you're going to show me on your Speaker 4 how you create a medication. Which you should be good to go because you've done the homework right? So you are going to ask Speaker 4 to add like no so so create a medication list for you. So let's see how you do with that.\n00:03:03 Speaker 4\nDo you want?\n00:03:05 Speaker 3\nDo you want to unmute and mute on your own?\n00:03:11 Speaker 2\nCan you add? As is done to my medicine list.\n00:03:19 Speaker 1\nShe didn't.\n00:03:20 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Can you add Trazodone to my medicine list?\n00:03:28 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find a list called medicine. Should I create one?\n00:03:31 Speaker 2\nYes, please.\n00:03:39 Speaker 4\nI've created medicine list and added Trazodone to it.\n00:03:44 Speaker 3\nOK. You.\n00:03:46 Speaker 1\nMedicine list or medication list.\n00:03:48 Speaker 2\nUnderstand.\n00:03:49 Speaker 1\nRight. But on Speaker 4, it's called medication. That's right.\n00:03:55 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:03:55 Speaker 1\nSo. So your medication is non prescription and medicine is prescription. Uh-huh.\n00:04:04 Speaker 3\nThat's right. OK. All right. So that's pretty good. How are you feeling about using Speaker 4 since we've started using it for, you know, a few weeks now, has it been helping you? What do you think, Speaker 2?\n00:04:26 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's been helping.\n00:04:28 Speaker 3\nOK, what have you been using it? The most for. Let's try that.\n00:04:37 Speaker 2\nQuite a bit.\n00:04:40 Speaker 1\nSuch as.\n00:04:42 Speaker 2\nSuch as just helping me.\n00:04:45 Speaker 1\nCan you give a detail please?\n00:04:45 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:04:47 Speaker 2\nYeah. Just helping me with life.\n00:04:52 Speaker 1\nWhat do you ask her for in the morning? A joke. M. And then.\n00:05:01 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:05:02 Speaker 1\nWhat else do you ask her to do for you?\n00:05:05 Speaker 2\nGood time.\n00:05:06 Speaker 1\nThe temperature.\n00:05:08 Speaker 3\nOK, so the temperature ask for a temperature. OK, that's perfect. Today's topic would be like, you know, it's it's very in tune with the the word temperature like asking for weather and temperature is very much, you know something that you're going to be doing so. That would definitely make sense. All right, so let's see. Uh, Speaker 1, did you watch e-mail about that I sent? You for the radio.\n00:05:42 Speaker 1\nNo, I didn't.\n00:05:44 Speaker 3\nNo. OK, all right. I sent it to. You this morning.\n00:05:47 Speaker 1\nOh, that's why I was at work all. Day.\n00:05:50 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. All right.\n00:05:50 Speaker 1\nAnd night from work home. But I'll look right now.\n00:05:53 Speaker 3\nOK. No, no, no worries. Don't. Don't worry about it. I mean I it should be there. I just sent some information on how to sort of activate it so that you would know. For the for that. So anyway. All right, let's get started with the questions for this week. So what type of information do you listen to? To the news, like how or what kind of information do you ask for when you ask for news?\n00:06:26 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 2.\n00:06:27 Speaker 2\nI'm gonna ask for news.

And you definitely told me about the weather because you were, you know, you're asking that question very often. So that's something that you definitely have, you know, an interest in. Alright, So what topics are you interested in discussing or learning about when it comes to news and facts? UM, it can be any anything random versus like, you know, sports health, you know, any of your interests that you want, like facts about it could be any of that.\n00:08:47 Speaker 1\nIs there anything in history that you'd like a fact about? OK, what would be an example of something in history?\n00:08:50 Speaker 2\nNo. History class.\n00:08:57 Speaker 1\nRight. So think of something that you would like to know more about?\n00:09:06 Speaker 2\nWorld War 2.\n00:09:07 Speaker 1\nOK. So what could you ask? OK. You know who about World War Two?

Go ahead. I'm sorry.\n00:09:51 Speaker 3\nSorry, no, I I said that. We'll come back to those kind of questions maybe like when we were practicing the commands. So what else, Speaker 2, is there anything else related to sports or health or any random questions that you would want to know? And do you ask your phone any sort of questions? Like that, you're just curious about, you know, is there anything that you would like to know?\n00:10:17 Speaker 1\nWhat about the Olympics? Is there anything you want to know about the Olympics? Maybe like how many countries are participating or? Maybe if a certain country, how many medals they got. Yeah. OK. So think of something like that. Hmm.

I I found that information and sort of copy pasted whatever I found on the web and I even tried doing that with the radio. So yeah, it should work. Hopefully it will work for the station that Speaker 2 wants to hear.\n00:11:32 Speaker 1\nOK, perfect. I appreciate you doing that. Thank you so much.\n00:11:35 Speaker 3\nYeah, absolutely. OK, all right. All right, so let's see. Can you think of so Speaker 2, now we are thinking of scenarios. Or like how you would use Speaker 4 for getting news facts and those sort of questions. So let's let's think of like scenarios where you would use like for getting news facts or any sort of random information or things that you're curious about. So definitely weather is 1 so I want to know. Or ask more about the weather or the temperature current temperature. What do you think? Which one?\n00:12:28 Speaker 2\nThe current temperature.\n00:12:30 Speaker 3\nCurrent temperature, OK.\n00:12:33 Speaker 1\nOK. I'm sorry, Speaker 3. I just looked in the junk mail and I found it.\n00:12:39 Speaker 3\nYou found it. OK, perfect.\n00:12:40 Speaker 1\nThank you. I just want to save you the export. Thank you.\n00:12:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. Oh, no worries. No worries. OK, alright.\n00:12:48 Speaker 1\nWhat do you want to know about temperature, Speaker 2?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature? That's it.\n00:12:56 Speaker 4\nRight now it's 85\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 64\u00b0.\n00:12:59 Speaker 2\nNice. OK.\n00:13:03 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK.\n00:13:04 Speaker 1\nLike you were going to ask Speaker 3 question, what was the question you were going to ask her? She remember, she said it was stormy by where she is. What was the question you were going to ask her?\n00:13:13 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm. Where do you live, bro?\n00:13:17 Speaker 3\nOh oh, I live in North Carolina.\n00:13:20 Speaker 1\nSo why don't you figure out what the temperature is for her?\n00:13:23 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the temperature in in North Carolina? China.\n00:13:29 Speaker 4\nRight now in Raleigh, NC, it's 77\u00b0F tonight. Expect a low of 74\u00b0.\n00:13:36 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. Alright. So also what? What else? What other scenarios can you think of when it comes to? UM. Getting to know more information.\n00:13:52 Speaker 1\nThat's something else, Speaker 2. What about on Mondays when we go to the brain, right? What am I always checking? Or what did Dad. Speaker 7check this Monday on your way to the brain?\n00:14:03 Speaker 2\nThat's true.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nThat's right. So wouldn't that be a good you could help Speaker 7out with that, couldn't you?\n00:14:10 Speaker 2\nMm-hmm.\n00:14:11 Speaker 1\nOK. How would you do that?\n00:14:13 Speaker 3\nLet's let's practice when we go to the breakout room again and we'll practice all these commands. OK, Speaker 2. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about the scenarios for now, and then we'll we will practice those when we go to, OK. So I want to know the traffic about the traffic situation when going to my appointment.\n00:14:40 Speaker 1\nYes. Yeah. Therapy place.\n00:14:43 Speaker 3\nYes, OK. Perfect. Anything else that you want to know about current events, Olympics? Yeah. Any anything, cars.\n00:15:00 Speaker 1\nOr politics. Speaker 2, what would you like to know?\n00:15:03 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:15:04 Speaker 1\nOK, what about politics? What's Donald Trump doing? OK, How's Donald Trump doing?\n00:15:11 Speaker 3\nOK, now about the presidential candidates.\n00:15:18 Speaker 2\nAll right.\n00:15:23 Speaker 3\nHi. Alright, what else? Anything else? Anything related to. You know, news other than politics. That you can think of.\n00:15:40 Speaker 1\nWhat about Speaker 2? There wasn't there a big buyer close to us recently?\n00:15:46 Speaker 2\nSP.\n00:15:47 Speaker 1\nYeah, in San Bernardino. So what about something about that?\n00:15:52 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:15:53 Speaker 1\nOK. If there's, if there's an earth has been an earthquake or a fire nearby. What about something?\n00:15:59 Speaker 3\nYeah, because that's very much, you know, something that's very personal to where you live, right? Speaker 2's living in California. That's definitely, yeah. OK. So about earthquakes and forest fires. Near me. Alright. Alright. Do you think you would want to know the date and the? You know the. So just to get be more oriented on a daily basis with the date and anything else like any kind of like orientation, date, date, any of that?\n00:16:42 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:16:43 Speaker 3\nYeah, that would be a good question to ask. If you sort of, you know, forget going to be oriented to the date and the day.\n00:16:52 Speaker 1\nIn the morning, Garth, Speaker 2's father asks him every day what day is today.\n00:16:58 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah.\n00:16:59 Speaker 1\nThat kind of thing. And if Speaker 2 doesn't know it?\n00:17:02 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:17:04 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 7will say so. How are you gonna figure it out? So he'll either ask. It depends if he's got his phone nearby or not, he'll ask Speaker 4 or Siri.\n00:17:15 Speaker 3\nYeah, that's perfect. OK, that makes.\n00:17:17 Speaker 4\nSense Siri is a virtual assistant application built into certain iOS devices. It here's what this says in response by web services that first Siri was an app in the App Store.\n00:17:17 Speaker 1\nThat's something.\n00:17:29 Speaker 2\nStop. Speaker 4, stop.\n00:17:33 Speaker 3\nIt started as she just started like. Go like you know, going and it does. She doesn't stop if you, especially with some kind of information. If it's yeah. Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n00:17:57 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:17:58 Speaker 1\nOK. Have we done it outside of the sessions? You. Oh, oh oh you have. Ohh, I didn't realize that I'm.\n00:18:06 Speaker 4\nSorry.\n00:18:07 Speaker 2\nSorry, Speaker 1.\n00:18:09 Speaker 1\nCan you mute her right now for us? You want to. Find her, yeah. Use your hand. You do it with your fingers. Remember the buttons on the device at the top. OK, so put your hand.\n00:18:24 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll remember this.\n00:18:27 Speaker 1\nYou put your hand on the top. And mute it. Perfect. He just did it on his own.\n00:18:42 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n00:19:14 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:14 Speaker 3\nLike, what do you think? OK. OK. Yep, makes sense. So like, maybe let's make a. Note that this week, after this week, like in today's session, we'll we will do it. We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4? Maybe let's try to do that.\n00:19:48 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. Yeah. All right. OK, so we are almost done with our section for the questions. UM, is there any, if there's anything else that you can think of, Speaker 2 related related to news and facts, let me know and we can add more information here, but for now. My question is for what's your goal really when it comes to using Speaker 4 with regards to? Yeah, news and facts and any of that. Like, like, what's your major goal? In general, what would you say?\n00:20:35 Speaker 2\nIn general.\n00:20:38 Speaker 3\nWhen it comes to news facts.\n00:20:44 Speaker 1\nTo using Speaker 4. In regards to the news facts that you hear on the news. Things going on in the world. What's your goal with using Speaker 4 for that?\n00:20:57 Speaker 2\nDouble check.\n00:20:59 Speaker 4\nOhh.\n00:21:00 Speaker 3\nOK, OK. Is to double check what? Right. What would you say?\n00:21:10 Speaker 1\nWhat do you mean by double check?\n00:21:11 Speaker 2\nDouble check all my standards.\n00:21:14 Speaker 1\nThe standards or the facts?\n00:21:17 Speaker 2\nStandards. In fact.\n00:21:21 Speaker 1\nAnd that's OK. Umm.\n00:21:27 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1. What? What would you say? Is it like, you know, checking facts that he has questions about just in general. And yeah, do you think?\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nAction General, for instance, we were. I remember his Speaker 7and I and Speaker 2 were in the family room and I can't remember if it was from a story that his Speaker 7has been reading to him.\n00:21:48 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:21:53 Speaker 1\nOr it was something on the news. It was about Stonehenge. Stonehenge, wasn't it? Something about Stonehenge? I can't remember what it was. And so Speaker 2 asked Speaker 4 about stone. Oh, no. It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot? Because Speaker 2 said it was one year and his Speaker 7said it was another. So they asked Speaker 4 to see who was. Yeah. Right.\n00:22:21 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:22:23 Speaker 1\nWhat exactly it was, but it was one. Maybe.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nOf those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n00:23:02 Speaker 1\nThere, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n00:23:05 Speaker 3\nYeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nAnd if you. All right.\n00:23:36 Speaker 1\nHave a question about some of your music? You could always ask Speaker 4 about that too.\n00:23:42 Speaker 3\nAnd we've learned that already anyway. But yes, that that topic is of course, like it's just such a such a thing that it's sort of considered facts too. No, no, it's not just information related to entertainment, but that's you know it it's yeah, it could be definitely, yeah, alright.\n00:24:02 Speaker 1\nWe went to that movie on Sunday, so if you had any questions about the accuracy of stuff, you could ask talking about where the movie was filmed at the different places. It was that twisters movie. So there it was filmed, remember. So you could ask her Speaker 4 about that. Oh, OK. Right.\n00:24:23 Speaker 4\nYeah.\n00:24:24 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:24:25 Speaker 1\nPerfect or not, that's perfect.\n00:24:27 Speaker 3\nYeah. Yeah. OK. So let's go back to the main room and then we will come back. The thing the commands. OK, alright, so. OK.\n00:24:38 Speaker 1\nOK, sounds good. Hi.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:24:50 Speaker 3\nAll right. Hey, Speaker 2. OK. Are you ready to practice some more commands? OK. All right, let me share my screen and we will get started.\n00:25:05 Speaker 6\nAnd Speaker 2 Speaker 6 is here too, just taking notes. Speaker 5. Want to say hi. She's unable to join you? So I'm just here to help Speaker 3 out.\n00:25:16 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:25:18 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt's.\n00:25:20 Speaker 3\nSorry, were you saying something?\n00:25:23 Speaker 2\nMakes sense?\n00:25:27 Speaker 3\nAll right, Speaker 2. So we're going to start with getting to know about the news. So we're going to say the command, Speaker 4, start flash debriefing or flash briefing.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nCan you do? That Speaker 2, you have to first, yeah.\n00:25:46 Speaker 4\nGo ahead.\n00:25:49 Speaker 3\nHe's unmuting. Perfect.\n00:25:52 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. OK. Can you start the flash, the flash debriefing?\n00:25:59 Speaker 4\nTo get started with flash briefing, choose an update from options like CNN, Fox, NPR and Reuters. What would you like to hear?\n00:26:08 Speaker 2\nBox.\n00:26:13 Speaker 4\nIn Fox News. Weather. On Fox Weather meteorologist for Erwin with the latest from Americas Weather Center as we continue to track Debbie, North Carolina just inundated by water, we have flash flood warnings. We also have tornado warnings, heartbreaking conditions across parts of North Carolina. We've had a fatality reported in the state, likely because of a tornado. As we go into this afternoon, this might be first, but every risk and it's still there and we have one morning to.\n00:26:38 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 2. Now we're going to. We're going to stop flash creeping.\n00:26:46 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:26:46 Speaker 1\nGet through Friday.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nPerfect. Yeah. Just stop. Works too. So perfect, Speaker 2.\n00:26:55 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:26:57 Speaker 3\nAnd you can play again or like you know how we practice during the entertainment portion of our training. It's the same way it's going to work. The play, pause and stop. It's gonna work the same way. All right, but this is a perfect way for you to sort of stay in the know house sort of like. Just. If you have a question about the daily events or anything or the news every day if you just like you know, sort of listen to this short, you know flash briefing, it will. Help. All right, let's move on. So the next one is about events on the calendar. So if you were to say, you're gonna say, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:27:33 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:27:48 Speaker 3\nCan you say that?\n00:27:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's on my calendar?\n00:28:01 Speaker 1\nWe haven't connected anything.\n00:28:04 Speaker 3\nOK. All right. But it it should at least say that ohh there is like you know nothing on your calendar or something but it didn't say anything did.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt pick up the.\n00:28:12 Speaker 1\nIt just it just. It did. It just said there's nothing.\n00:28:16 Speaker 3\nScheduled. OK, OK. Perfect. Perfect. I did. I couldn't hear that. Oh. Sorry about that. OK, alright.\n00:28:21 Speaker 1\nSo would that be the same as connecting the Apple music? I just can connect to Apple calendar. Because Speaker 2's calendar is, it's actually my calendar that I share with. I share all of my I I don't know if you really you know on Apple you can have like a million different calendars. I have one. That's Speaker 2 and I share that with Speaker 2. So all of his appointments.\n00:28:35 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:28:48 Speaker 1\nAnd upon his phone.\n00:28:49 Speaker 3\nOn his phone, OK. OK, there should be a way to sync that. I think I I will get back to you on that, but.\n00:28:57 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:01 Speaker 3\nLed to yes. And let's say right now, let's practice this like creating an event on for Speaker 4 so that it would be it, it would sort of sort of show up on the device and see if that works. So is there any any kind of event that you would like to create? Speaker 2, anything in general?\n00:29:25 Speaker 1\nWhere are you going tomorrow with your dad?\n00:29:28 Speaker 2\nAwesome.\n00:29:29 Speaker 1\nThat's already on the calendar. What's the other thing you and your Speaker 7are going to go? To after Casa.\n00:29:33 Speaker 2\nGood.\n00:29:34 Speaker 1\nTo the gym. That's right. So, and what time did he say you you guys were going to? Go. Around. No, because that guy's coming around too, I think.\n00:29:44 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:29:45 Speaker 1\nSo use the 2:00 PM time.\n00:29:49 Speaker 3\nAll right. So Speaker 2, you're going to say, uh, Speaker 4, create an event for gym at 2:00 PM.\n00:29:58 Speaker 1\nWhen? Tomorrow. OK. Go for.\n00:30:02 Speaker 2\nIt yeah. Speaker 4 tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create a? Appointment for me. Jim.\n00:30:14 Speaker 1\nShe didn't hear you. We'll have to try again.\n00:30:16 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM can you create an appointment for me? For the gym.\n00:30:27 Speaker 4\nSure. And what's the name of the event?\n00:30:30 Speaker 2\nGym gym.\n00:30:38 Speaker 4\nOK, I've added that.\n00:30:41 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:30:43 Speaker 3\nRight. Perfect. Fact. OK, let's see. All right, so let's see if we wanted to know who is the? Who's running for President Speaker 2? So let's ask the question Speaker 4, who is running for President?\n00:31:07 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, who's running for president?\n00:31:12 Speaker 4\nThere are six public figures who have confirmed their candidacy for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's candidate. Former President Donald Trump is the Republican Party's candidate, Robert F Kennedy junior, Jill Stein, Cornell West, and Chase Oliver are running as third party candidates.\n00:31:34 Speaker 3\nAll right.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:31:37 Speaker 3\nAll right. Speaker 2, would you like to know when the election is, when is the Election Day?\n00:31:43 Speaker 2\nNovember.\n00:31:44 Speaker 3\nUh, do you know the date? No. OK, so let's ask Speaker 4 dot Speaker 4, when is the election?\n00:31:53 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, when's the election?\n00:32:01 Speaker 4\nThe 2024 presidential election will be held November 5th, 2024, to check your voter registration information, visit usa.gov/voter Dash registration.\n00:32:14 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:32:14 Speaker 3\nOK. But. All right. So Speaker 2, do you remember how Speaker 8 was talking about that? You can ask what's interesting now. So we we'll probably like just get facts about what's interesting. And it would probably give different facts on different times, I would say. So that's a that's a something interesting question to ask every every time or everything. Anytime you're curious about something, but you don't know what to ask. So let's see. Let's try that. What's interesting?\n00:32:53 Speaker 1\nThe last in full price.\n00:33:03 Speaker 3\nAlright, you want to try that?\n00:33:05 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:33:06 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:33:07 Speaker 1\nYou're asking a lot. You're asking what is interesting now.\n00:33:12 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now?\n00:33:20 Speaker 1\nThat will be.\n00:33:23 Speaker 4\nWelcome to what's interesting. Now each day I'll create a feed of stories personalized for you to skip a story you can say next to hear something different, you can ask me for a topic you're interested in. Up first five stories on Rancho Cucamonga. Los Angeles Times.\n00:33:41 Speaker 1\nColin Yost has left his 2024 Olympics post behind after his gig into he resulted in multiple health concerns. The Saturday Night Live comedian reportedly resigned from his serving correspondent duties before the events on the French Polynesian Island came to an end Wednesday.\n00:33:58 Speaker 3\nRight. OK. So Speaker 2, definitely this is a very general question. OK, sorry.\n00:34:05 Speaker 2\nLost.\n00:34:09 Speaker 3\nPerfect. OK. Sorry. I thought it was done. I I didn't know that it was going to keep going, but OK, alright. So Speaker 2, definitely this is like more general information when you were asking about like what's an interesting what what's interesting now, but you can always narrow it down to. What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one. And yeah, what countries won the medals? Like you were saying, that sort of thing too. So we can practice like specific questions like that too. Just so you know. Yeah, but should be able to.\n00:35:05 Speaker 1\nDo you want to know what's going on, where your sister is right now? Where is she?\n00:35:11 Speaker 2\nCan you?\n00:35:11 Speaker 1\nShe's in Kenya on a mission. Ohh, OK. At you know what part of Kenya?\n00:35:19 Speaker 2\nI don't know.\n00:35:19 Speaker 1\nNairobi OK, so try to figure out that.\n00:35:22 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4. Where is Nairobi.\n00:35:28 Speaker 4\nOK, I will. The city in Nairobi County, in the southwestern part of Kenya.\n00:35:32 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, stop.\n00:35:34 Speaker 1\nRemember, you're asking about information or facts or something interesting.\n00:35:40 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:35:42 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4. Nairobi, Kenya is uh. Consisting of. Terrorists or what?\n00:35:51 Speaker 3\nOK, so let's let's ask this. Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:35:59 Speaker 1\nDid you hear about Speaker 3 said? So you need to ask.\n00:36:02 Speaker 3\nWhat's it just? Yeah. What's interesting now in Kenya can you can you? Ask Speaker 4 that.\n00:36:09 Speaker 2\nHey Speaker 4, what's interesting now in Kenya?\n00:36:16 Speaker 4\nFrom goats on throw.com. While in Kenya, you'll have the opportunity to experience the great migration in Masai Mara, explore old towns like Lami, Climb Africa's second highest mountain, Mount Kenyon, and so much more.\n00:36:31 Speaker 1\nOK, interesting facts about where she's at, right?\n00:36:32 Speaker 6\nVicky.\n00:36:35 Speaker 3\nYeah. Mm-hmm. And I think if you wanted to know more related to the news, maybe you would be you could ask what's? Tell me some news about Nairobi, Kenya or like, you know, give me a flash briefing about Nairobi, Kenya, maybe that might give you the news for, like, the current news or something related to any political, you know, information. Or any of that like you know, if you're looking for. You know, weather related or political anything?\n00:37:14 Speaker 2\nYeah, makes sense.\n00:37:15 Speaker 3\nAll right. OK. Alright. So let's move on. So here comes the traffic command. So you know how you would like to. You said that you and your Speaker 7like to check the traffic when you are going for your appointment for your therapy. So let's see. Do you wanna ask the question what's the traffic like?\n00:37:43 Speaker 2\nRight now.\n00:37:45 Speaker 1\nYes, right now. Go ahead.\n00:37:50 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like? Right now.\n00:37:58 Speaker 4\nTo give you traffic on your commute, I need to know your work address. Would you like to provide that now?\n00:38:04 Speaker 3\nOK, so in that case you can say what's the traffic like going towards? Where is the appointment? What city or what zip code is that? You when you.\n00:38:17 Speaker 1\nCheck the board to Cypress, CA.\n00:38:21 Speaker 2\nTowards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:23 Speaker 3\nOK, so you might want to repeat the command.\n00:38:27 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's the warp mute to Cypress, CA?\n00:38:37 Speaker 3\nOK. So Speaker 2, we are asking the about the traffic, right. So we're going to say what's the traffic like it going towards Cypress, CA.\n00:38:49 Speaker 1\nWhat's the traffic like?\n00:38:49 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including the street and city.\n00:38:54 Speaker 3\nOh, OK.\n00:38:55 Speaker 2\nSpeaker 4, what's the traffic like going to Cypress, CA?\n00:39:03 Speaker 4\nSorry, try again with the full address, including.\n00:39:08 Speaker 3\nOK, alright. Do you have any particular address that you would like to sort of practice, man?\n00:39:13 Speaker 4\nSet this later after notification I've sent to the Speaker 4 app on your phone when it's safe to do so.\n00:39:17 Speaker 1\nOh.\n00:39:20 Speaker 2\nMHM.\n00:39:21 Speaker 1\nAsk how just use this one use. Ask what the traffic is like to EJ Marshall Elementary. See if that works.\n00:39:34 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's traffic like to EJ Marshall Elementary?\n00:39:41 Speaker 4\nRight now, traffic to EJ Marshall Elementary at 12045 Telephone Ave. looks a bit slow. The fastest route takes about 25 minutes via I-15 and CA-60.\n00:39:53 Speaker 3\nOK, perfect. So I think the name of your therapy clinic or the hospital where you're going to the center would should work, because that should be, uh, like, you know, sort of that information should be there. So that should that should mostly work if you were to ask the same question. OK. Alright, let's try this. So here's a question. About like exercises for like lower back pain. But you can you can try it for any any other sort of like you know uh body part or anything else that you want to know like. Is there anything related to workouts that you want to know or exercises? No. OK.\n00:40:40 Speaker 1\nOhh, acupuncture is are good things. For me, what about that?\n00:40:44 Speaker 2\nThe acupuncture good thing for me.\n00:40:47 Speaker 3\nOhh yeah, that's a good one. OK, so you wanna ask that question with with? The wake word.\n00:40:54 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, is acupuncture a good thing for me?\n00:41:00 Speaker 4\nHere's something I found on reference.com. The benefits of acupuncture therapy are numerous, and clinical studies have shown that acupuncture can help with diseases and conditions such as dysentery, allergic rhinitis, depression, facial pain, headaches, hypertension, knee pain, lower back pain, morning sickness, neck pain, dental pain, renal colics, rheumatoid arthritis. Sciatica, pain, strain, pain, stroke, pain and tennis elbow, according to the UC San Diego Center for Integrative. Medicine acupuncture therapy can also help increase labor and help.\n00:41:32 Speaker 1\nGive them stuff for Speaker 2.\n00:41:33 Speaker 2\nYeah, that's it. So.\n00:41:37 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:41:40 Speaker 3\nAll right. All right. Let's do one last one, OK. That that, that was very long in my opinion, I think. It was just. So much information and I I think like for. Someone who's not looking at the screen, it's just too much information in one one go. I think it's very overwhelming. I wish that they would be able to like, you know, just chunk the most important ones and then say that, hey, do you want to, do you want me to continue or something? Do you want me to tell you more? You know, because that's just so long. I. I mean. Very much, yeah. If you're not looking at the list, it's just way too much information. Alright, alright, Speaker 2. But you were doing such a great job. I think it's amazing the amount of attention that you have. And you're you're. I think you're doing great with everything. OK.\n00:42:43 Speaker 2\nThank you.\n00:42:43 Speaker 3\nYeah. All right, let's do one last command. So I know that you like history, so we're gonna ask this question. What is the history of the Olympic Games? To Speaker 4, OK, so.\n00:43:00 Speaker 2\nWhat? What is the history of the Olympic Games? She didn't hear you, Speaker 4? What is the history of the Olympic Games?\n00:43:15 Speaker 4\nHere is an answer from an Speaker 4 Answers contributor that I translated. The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in 776 BC. They were held every four years in Olympia.\n00:43:29 Speaker 2\nThanks a lot.\n00:43:32 Speaker 3\nOK, all that is good information. I I like that. Like you know how short that was, I I. Feel like? If if someone's only hearing the information, it should be short and then ask follow up questions that if you want me to continue or something, but sometimes it doesn't do that.\n00:43:43 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:43:50 Speaker 3\nAnd it it's annoying. I totally get it. Alright, OK. There's I think there's one more question. I don't know if if you're up for trying, it's fine. It's just something random. It just says, Speaker 4, what is mangosteen? If you want to, we can or we can leave it out. It's up to you, Speaker 2.\n00:44:14 Speaker 2\nSure. Hey, Speaker 4. What's it mean that you will mangosteen?\n00:44:22 Speaker 1\nMan goes slim. Try again.\n00:44:30 Speaker 2\nHey, Speaker 4, what's it mean that you were mangosteen?\n00:44:36 Speaker 4\nWhen an individual remembers something, it implies that the related information or activity has been stored in the memory and can be easily retrieved whenever required.\n00:44:45 Speaker 3\nIt probably just, I think, misinterpreted the information. So you were asking the question, what is mangosteen.\n00:44:54 Speaker 1\nMango. Dean. Speaker 2 ask that question. What is?\n00:45:03 Speaker 2\nWhat is mangosteen?\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: M.A.\n- Age: Not specified\n- Gender: Not specified\n- Date: 08-08-2024\n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** \nPatient M.A. is participating in a training session to improve the use of a virtual assistant (Alexa) for daily tasks and information retrieval.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**\nM.A. is engaged in a training program to enhance independence in using a virtual assistant for various tasks, including medication management, news updates, and general inquiries.

This can be achieved by including a directive to prioritize the inclusion of these elements in the SOAP note.\n\n2. **Highlight Interaction Dynamics**: The prompt should guide the LLM to pay particular attention to the interaction dynamics between M.A., his mother, and the clinician. This includes recognizing the role of verbal cues, support, and prompting provided by M.A.'s mother. By emphasizing these aspects, the LLM can produce a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the session.\n\n3. **Reduce Clinical Analysis Focus**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to minimize the emphasis on clinical analysis, such as differential diagnoses and structured plans, unless explicitly relevant to the session. Instead, the focus should be on practical aspects, such as the specific commands practiced and the homework assignments given.\n\n4. **Incorporate Homework Assignments**: The system prompt should remind the LLM to include any homework assignments or follow-up actions discussed during the session. This ensures that the generated note provides a complete picture of the session's objectives and future steps.\n\n5. **Align with Target Note Structure**: The prompt should guide the LLM to closely follow the structure and content of the target note. This includes providing a clear framework for organizing the SOAP note, ensuring that all relevant details from the session are captured accurately.\n\n6. **Encourage Consistency and Focus**: The prompt should emphasize the importance of maintaining consistency in content and focus with the target note. This involves ensuring that all relevant details are present and that the note accurately reflects the session's dynamics and objectives.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt can better guide the LLM's reasoning strategy, resulting in a more accurate and aligned SOAP note that meets the objective function effectively.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-25-2024 M.A. User Needs Assessment.m4a\n\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.A.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.A.\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.A.\u2019s Alexa\nSpeaker 5: Clinician\nSpeaker 6: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 7: Clinician\nSpeaker 8: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 2\n1st is you're gonna show me how you could set up and set up a reminder or an appointment with your Speaker 4?\n00:00:09 Speaker 1\nOK.

It's called.\n00:04:11 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:04:13 Speaker 1\nBut it's got a shadow of the.\n00:04:16 Speaker 2\nRight.\n00:04:17 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:04:18 Speaker 1\nAnd so I helped get Speaker 3 set up on it on the Xbox.\n00:04:21 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:04:23 Speaker 1\nAnd then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:29 Speaker 2\nAll right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:34 Speaker 2\nOK.\n00:04:36 Speaker 3\nAlright.

OK. All right.\n00:05:03 Speaker 4\nMe.\n00:05:07 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To currently use for for these uh, entertainment activities. So definitely there's TV.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMHM.\n00:05:28 Speaker 2\nRight, what else?

So now we're gonna come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know, the things that you can say to Speaker 4 so that it could play it for you. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what? Would the first one be here?\n00:06:55 Speaker 1\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 3 on TV. How would you go about doing that?\n00:07:02 Speaker 3\nClick the channel.\n00:07:05 Speaker 1\nOK, OK. So to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:05 Speaker 3\nWatch it. Hey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:13 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel? Is Isaac.\n00:07:20 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:21 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that correct?\n00:07:22 Speaker 1\nShe just.\n00:07:24 Speaker 2\nYeah.\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:28 Speaker 4\nBecause it's more related to that.\n00:07:31 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:32 Speaker 1\nAnd.\n00:07:37 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:07:49 Speaker 4\nSomething say it again.\n00:07:52 Speaker 2\nEyes help you with law.\n00:07:52 Speaker 1\nShould I you, Sir?\n00:07:54 Speaker 2\nYeah.

From particular.\n00:08:56 Speaker 3\nArtists.\n00:08:57 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. What else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:14 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:09:17 Speaker 2\nOK, alright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:26 Speaker 3\nLove yourself.\n00:09:26 Speaker 2\nAuditory. Stimuli and feedback. Oh.\n00:09:33 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:09:35 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYou used to. A lot of.\n00:09:42 Speaker 2\nAny particular kind of like maybe you know how some of those games have? Like, they're related to words or some are, you know, it's like jeopardy or some are. Testing games, things like that. Like is there. Is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:09:59 Speaker 3\nOh.\n00:10:01 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. All right. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:13 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:10:15 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:15 Speaker 1\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:20 Speaker 3\nYeah, I did. Yeah.\n00:10:25 Speaker 1\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say, like uh, you know, high hey like like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play it.\n00:10:49 Speaker 1\nOK. Is that something Speaker 3, did you used to watch Netflix a lot?\n00:10:53 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. What?\n00:10:54 Speaker 1\nSo I can put out my account on there for him, is that correct?\n00:11:01 Speaker 2\nYeah you can. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think? Of or. That's about it.\n00:11:14 Speaker 3\nThat's about it.\n00:11:16 Speaker 2\nHi, alright. Speaker 3, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:27 Speaker 3\nThanks.\n00:11:28 Speaker 1\nYeah. OK.\n00:11:30 Speaker 2\nAlright, so we're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands as a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:11:55 Speaker 1\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you are you thinking of like? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely different?\n00:12:27 Speaker 2\nSo Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills, which are games. And which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that with your voice. So definitely that and then.\n00:12:47 Speaker 1\nWhere might I find a? List of. Of those types of games.\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nSo if you would like just go, if you go on Amazon app like the UM, Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games and it it it has, like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like they have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal. OK. Things like that, which are very, very familiar. Of course that those are part of the TV. So but there are different other things as well, so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:31 Speaker 1\nAnd then I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated. OK.\n00:13:35 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:13:38 Speaker 1\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:13:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something, UM, interest that, that would entrust him, I will send it to you.\n00:14:01 Speaker 1\nAs well, uh, that would be.\n00:14:02 Speaker 2\nAwesome. We'll share with him.\n00:14:04 Speaker 1\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that. Or in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision, like luminosity or cognitive, like the names are. I'm kind of escaping them but.\n00:14:16 Speaker 6\nBecause.\n00:14:23 Speaker 1\nThe the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad. IPad so. It just it isn't accessible so.\n00:14:45 Speaker 2\nIt does, yeah, yeah. No, but definitely there are I guess, which require even though there is visualized visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know? So. So yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that, you know. He he cannot play, so that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions, you know, so that it it. Kind of stay sharp, right? Like, that's that's something we all need to do. But definitely that will. That'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time. Speaker 3, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:28 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 3, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it.\n00:15:35 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:15:35 Speaker 1\nRight. I don't think she heard you.\n00:15:44 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:15:49 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:15:55 Speaker 3\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:15:58 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:00 Speaker 3\n9:30.\n00:16:02 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder at 9:37.\n00:16:06 Speaker 3\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:08 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go? For to go to a beach. Ohh, that's amazing. OK alright.\n00:16:15 Speaker 1\nI said, where are we going tomorrow? It's to give me an idea for what? To set it for.\n00:16:21 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM it will it will set it to the closest like so since it's evening already it's going to set it. To. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know? Yeah, it will just set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:16:49 Speaker 1\nYes.\n00:16:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. OK. All right.\n00:16:54 Speaker 4\nOK.\n00:16:57 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room. Hey, all right. Hey, Speaker 3. OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. All right, Speaker 3. So this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next or would you? To do a joke.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:17:43 Speaker 3\nA joke.\n00:17:44 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some. Use it. Some music all right. All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me like a Star Trek joke. Speaker 4, tell me a Doctor Who joke. Anything that you like can can can be a joke like that so. Sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:18:39 Speaker 3\nTry a joke.\n00:18:41 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:18:47 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:18:51 Speaker 4\nHere's a despicable new joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:05 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:07 Speaker 4\nGuidance.\n00:19:16 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 3. OK.\n00:19:17 Speaker 5\n1st.\n00:19:19 Speaker 3\nYou're the most.\n00:19:21 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:19:49 Speaker 3\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:19:56 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:01 Speaker 1\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:04 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 3, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom which sort of means that. It heard your voice or it. It's the wake up word for it. So uh, it. It almost means that it the UM the device is. Listening so. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get it goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are a lot of questions even online when you just like. Kind of search that what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. So.\n00:21:21 Speaker 3\nThank you.\n00:21:24 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 3.\n00:21:33 Speaker 1\nMake a clean one.\n00:21:35 Speaker 3\nNipsey hussle.\n00:21:39 Speaker 1\nIt's not that clean. It's not. You can do anything, Speaker 3. Whatever you want. Just.\n00:21:50 Speaker 3\nCan I get a clean song?\n00:21:54 Speaker 1\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:21:55 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can I get cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:00 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with a cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:08 Speaker 1\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:10 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:21 Speaker 1\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey song.\n00:22:22 Speaker 2\nNo. Oh yeah.\n00:22:24 Speaker 3\nAnd lexicon song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:22:37 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. An app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something. Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like yeah, even.\n00:23:00 Speaker 1\nOK. What's a common song living on a prayer?\n00:23:07 Speaker 3\nLiving on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:11 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:15 Speaker 2\nOh, hey. So Speaker 3, I guess.\n00:23:20 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month contained canceled. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. OK. Should I sign you up and play?\n00:23:27 Speaker 4\nLiving on a prayer.\n00:23:27 Speaker 1\nTo say not right now.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 3, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:23:51 Speaker 3\nSweet Caroline.\n00:23:54 Speaker 1\nTell.\n00:23:55 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:23:59 Speaker 1\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:02 Speaker 4\nNurses station, based on student Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:07 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:10 Speaker 1\nThere you go.\n00:24:13 Speaker 2\nYeah, alright. Is it playing?\n00:24:17 Speaker 1\nIt is.\n00:24:18 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. Alright. Do you want to? Do the volume up or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:33 Speaker 3\nThat we have.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:24:40 Speaker 3\nYeah, like I said, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:24:47 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward the stream.\n00:24:50 Speaker 1\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:24:54 Speaker 4\nReally. Yeah.\n00:24:56 Speaker 2\nThat's so odd.\n00:24:58 Speaker 3\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:00 Speaker 1\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know.\n00:25:05 Speaker 2\nHuh.\n00:25:09 Speaker 1\nWhy don't you say volume? Speaker 3.\n00:25:12 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:18 Speaker 1\nIt did the opposite, yeah. Give it how many times I believe.\n00:25:28 Speaker 3\nVolume up by 3.\n00:25:31 Speaker 4\nAnd no sound. If I.\n00:25:43 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 3. Down two times.\n00:25:46 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 4, volume down to times.\n00:25:52 Speaker 1\nYeah, it did. There you go.\n00:25:54 Speaker 2\nPerfect. How about we try? The two play it from the beginning.\n00:26:05 Speaker 3\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:14 Speaker 1\nTry again.\n00:26:15 Speaker 3\nHey, Alex, can you play this song from the beginning? So. Hey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:29 Speaker 4\nHe's starting his song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:26:35 Speaker 2\nThere was a lot of restrictions here I. Guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and. Go back, play from the beginning. All of that also, we're definitely able to do all of that so. Yeah.\n00:27:05 Speaker 1\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 3 has Apple music. I wonder. Yeah. That when I should be able to hook the Apple music. To.\n00:27:17 Speaker 2\nIt yeah, you should be able to. OK. Definitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. OK. Alright. And maybe if you had like a. Made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well. You know. So our previous songs go back.\n00:27:56 Speaker 1\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 3 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:08 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line, one step blue line is on and then you start speaking it definitely picks up the command better. Right. I think if it's in if if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it it doesn't usually it. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 3 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just wanna say, like, maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works. Yeah. Where there's, like, a just a very small pause. It doesn't even have to be very long because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you, you're not going to say anything. Next. So. Yeah, but more or less, you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying, uh, playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you. Yeah, but OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Alright, so even even though Speaker 3 you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But. It just has to be just Speaker 4. Uh. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Uh. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has, yeah.\n00:30:45 Speaker 1\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 3 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will. Well, and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give a visual description of what's going on in the background of the movie. So it'll describe the scenes and some TV's do that, ours doesn't. But some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature. So I dream if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's I it's something description, audio description or something like that.\n00:31:20 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:31:35 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:31:35 Speaker 1\nJust.\n00:31:48 Speaker 2\nSo.\n00:31:48 Speaker 1\nDo you understand? I'm trying. I'm. I'm.\n00:31:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Yeah, it's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the sure that's going on on the screen, so. Thanks.\n00:32:06 Speaker 1\nFor what you have on the screen right now, it would say something like blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background. And. With the following word.\n00:32:18 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. Uh, if if it has the kind of. Captioning or yeah.\n00:32:33 Speaker 5\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:32:35 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about.\n00:32:39 Speaker 5\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 3, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example if you. Decide to like look up pictures. From like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own closed captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us in that respect.\n00:33:32 Speaker 1\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:02 Speaker 2\nStarting to. OK. OK. Right. Right. Yeah, like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh, But yeah, I mean, maybe if they're not providing yet, but hopefully in the future, very soon, even Alex, I should start providing that. Hopefully that that will help a lot. Yeah.\n00:34:23 Speaker 1\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:26 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:29 Speaker 3\nM.\n00:34:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. All right. So I guess that's about it. Let me stop sharing. Alright. Is there anything else, Speaker 3 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or? Anything related? To today's. Question.\n00:34:59 Speaker 3\nNo.\n00:34:59 Speaker 2\nOr in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:03 Speaker 1\nI don't think yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 3's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch it back to our house. So it worked out because Speaker 3 was living in Kansas. Prior to, you know.\n00:35:25 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, sure. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help you. With any of those.\n00:35:45 Speaker 1\nOK. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:35:51 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 3, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:01 Speaker 1\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 3. There you go.\n00:36:03 Speaker 2\nAlright, perfect. There you go. All right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main main main room or?\n00:36:21 Speaker 1\nLet.\n00:36:21 Speaker 2\nWhat should we do?\n00:36:21 Speaker 1\nMe.\n00:36:25 Speaker 5\nIt looks.\n00:36:25 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave and go to the main room.\n00:36:28 Speaker 5\nI don't know. Yeah, we I guess we could go cause I or. I don't know if people left or. People went back.\n00:36:37 Speaker 2\nI have no clue.\n00:36:43 Speaker 5\nGenex group is back. In the news.\n00:36:45 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the meeting room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah. Yeah. No, thank.\n00:36:54 Speaker 1\nAll right.\n00:36:55 Speaker 5\nYou so much for the recommendation.\n00:36:56 Speaker 2\nThank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:01 Speaker 1\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, leave the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy --------------------------------------------- 00:37:20 Speaker 7\nHey. Speaker 3, we have friends who are still working on their things. Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more, cause Speaker 4 is too. Quick for him. So we did have that. Speaker 6, you're very up to speed with your old Speaker 8 and Speaker 3. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So if you're done, we just want to say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Speaker 6.\n00:37:56 Speaker 6\nBye.\n00:37:58 Speaker 7\nOhh bye. Ohh Speaker 6. I did want to say we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type.\n00:38:25 Speaker 6\nType in. See.\n00:38:29 Speaker 7\nOK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 1, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 3 and Speaker 1, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:25 Speaker 6\nWhere are you sending the link for me?\n00:39:28\nOK.\n00:39:30 Speaker 7\nSo.\n00:39:30 Speaker 6\nMuticus.\n00:39:33 Speaker 7\nIt's in the chat, Speaker 6, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:39:45 Speaker 6\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:39:51 Speaker 7\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on. Your. IPad but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:18 Speaker 6\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:22 Speaker 7\nOK, four. E-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:33 Speaker 1\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Claire sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it the QUADRA survey. That one. So we send that we fill that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to. Send later on in the week.\n00:40:55 Speaker 7\nYeah, for the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders, so. OK, just share some feedback on what you explored and Claire had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:08 Speaker 1\nPerfect.\n00:41:09 Speaker 7\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance to do it, so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one. For this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us, so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you all next Thursday. Bye.\n00:41:42 Speaker 1\nOK. Bye. Thank you.\n00:41:48 Speaker 3\nSee you later on.\n00:42:05 Speaker 1\nOK. Speaker 6 has Tina.\n00:42:11 Speaker 4\nAgnes.\n00:42:33 Speaker 7\nRosie, did you get the homework link I emailed you?\n00:42:35 Speaker 5\nYeah, I I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:42:38 Speaker 7\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday. Bye.\n00:42:41 Speaker 6\nRight.\n00:42:45 Speaker 5\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I was. Cracking up the entire time.\n00:42:52 Speaker 7\nHey, I don't know how you run it with the poker face.\n00:42:58 Speaker 5\nOh my God.\n00:42:59 Speaker 7\nStop the video. Ohh boy. Ohh. Who has it all? Well, you are recording. OK, stop that.\n00:43:09 Speaker 5\nOh my God, that was so funny.\n00:43:11 Speaker 7\nSo funny. OK, who had this? That was not me. I think it's you.\n00:43:14 Speaker 2\nEqual. OK here I stopped it. Stop it. Wait, why is it? Stop being recording. OK? I don't know.\n00:43:25 Speaker 7\nIt's recording, I don't know.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.A.  \n**Date:** 07-25-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Setting:** 1:1 Interview  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M.A. is participating in a session to assess the use of technology for reminders and entertainment.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \nM.A. is a [age not specified] year-old male with visual impairment. During the session, he demonstrated the ability to set reminders and appointments using his Alexa device. He expressed satisfaction with his ability to independently set a reminder for a class at 5:45 PM and a timer for the evening. M.A. enjoys watching sports, particularly ice hockey, and playing video games. He relies on a caregiver to assist him with details about games and uses auditory games designed for visually impaired individuals, such as \"Shadow of the Veil.\" M.A. also expressed interest in listening to music and watching movies, indicating a preference for clean versions of songs.\n\n**Review of Systems (ROS):**  \n- **General:** No weight loss or appetite changes reported.  \n- **Entertainment Activities:** Enjoys sports, video games, and music.  \n- **Technology Use:** Uses Alexa for reminders and entertainment, including music and games.\n\n**Current Medications:** None reported.  \n**Allergies:** None reported.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\n**Vital Signs:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Physical Exam Findings:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Laboratory Data:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Imaging Results:** Not applicable in this context.  \n**Other Diagnostic Data:** M.A. successfully set reminders and engaged with the Alexa device, demonstrating understanding and ability to use technology for entertainment and scheduling.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Problem 1:** Visual impairment affecting independent engagement with technology.  \n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Visual impairment (primary diagnosis)\n     - Cognitive impairment (less likely, as M.A. demonstrates understanding and engagement)\n   - **Discussion:** M.A. shows good cognitive function and ability to use technology effectively with assistance. His visual impairment necessitates adaptations in how he interacts with media and technology.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Technology Training:**\n   - Continue to provide training on using Alexa for reminders, music, and games.\n   - Explore additional auditory games compatible with M.A.'s needs.\n\n2. **Entertainment Options:**\n   - Encourage M.A. to explore streaming services (e.g., Apple Music, Spotify) to enhance his music experience.\n   - Discuss the possibility of integrating Netflix for audio descriptions of shows and movies.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess M.A.'s progress with technology use and engagement in entertainment activities.\n   - Provide resources for auditory games and apps that are accessible for visually impaired users.\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - Educate M.A. and his caregiver on the importance of using technology to enhance independence and engagement in leisure activities.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:** M.A. demonstrated enthusiasm and capability in using technology, indicating a positive outlook on his ability to engage with entertainment and reminders independently. Further support and resources will be beneficial in enhancing his experience. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and better align the language model's output with the objective function, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Emphasize Alignment with Target Note Structure**: The system prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to adhere closely to the structure and content of the target SOAP note. This can be achieved by including a directive to focus on the specific interactions during the session, such as M.A.'s use of Alexa and the involvement of his mother. By emphasizing the importance of matching the target note's format and content, the LLM can produce a more aligned output.\n\n2. **Highlight the Importance of Specific Details**: The prompt should stress the need to incorporate detailed accounts of M.A.'s interactions with Alexa, including specific commands practiced and the level of assistance required. This can be done by instructing the LLM to pay attention to the success rate of commands, any assistance or cueing provided, and the specific tasks M.A. practiced. By focusing on these details, the LLM can reduce the loss score by providing a more comprehensive and accurate note.\n\n3. **Focus on User Needs Assessment**: The prompt should guide the LLM to emphasize the user needs assessment and the level of cueing required for M.A. to participate effectively. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to detail the assessment process and the specific needs identified during the session. By including this focus, the LLM can produce a note that better matches the target note's emphasis on user needs.\n\n4. **Omit Unnecessary Sections**: The prompt should instruct the LLM to exclude sections like \"Chief Complaint\" and \"Differential Diagnosis\" if they are not present in the target note. By guiding the LLM to omit these sections, the generated note can better match the target note's content and focus.\n\n5. **Incorporate a Detailed Plan Section**: The prompt should direct the LLM to include a detailed plan with specific tasks and commands for M.A. to practice at home. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to incorporate specific tasks and commands to align with the target note's level of detail and specificity.\n\n6. **Ensure Tone and Detail Consistency**: The prompt should guide the LLM to match the level of detail and specificity in the target note, ensuring that the tone and focus are consistent. This can be achieved by instructing the LLM to provide a detailed and specific account of M.A.'s interactions and the involvement of his mother.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into the system prompt, the LLM can be better guided to produce a response that aligns with the target SOAP note, thereby reducing the loss score and achieving the objective function more effectively.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are a clinician who is responsible for generating a SOAP Note from the conversation between the doctor(s) and the patient.

Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> What would a comprehensive SOAP note look like based strictly on the \n    following conversation between a patient and a clinician: Audio file\n07-18-2024 M.A. User needs assessment (Entertainment) + 1-1 individual session.m4a\nSpeaker 1: Patient M.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient M.\u2019s Caregiver\nSpeaker 4: Patient M.\u2019s Alexa\nTranscript\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n00:00:00 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 2.\n00:00:04 Speaker 2\nHow are you today, Speaker 1?\n00:00:06 Speaker 1\nHow are you?\n00:00:08 Speaker 2\nOh, I'm good.\n00:00:10 Speaker 1\nNice.\n00:00:11 Speaker 2\nDid you get any chance to practice any of your commands?

And by me drawing it, he could under he could put 2 + 2 together.\n00:04:08 Speaker 2\nYeah. And Speaker 1, how about anything else that you do like apart from, OK, so video games, how how do you, how do you go about doing that lately?\n00:04:20 Speaker 3\nThere's one that one game that we found. What is it called? The.\n00:04:26 Speaker 1\nThe black one.\n00:04:27 Speaker 3\nNo, the there's an auditory game.\n00:04:30 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:04:32 Speaker 3\nThat has been developed for visually impaired people. It's called. Perfect. Remember, it's called a shadow of the veil. And so I helped get Speaker 1 set up on it on Xbox, and then he can play it because it's all auditory. Ohh. Perfect.\n00:04:46 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. And what did you say it's called?\n00:04:57 Speaker 1\nShadow of the veil.\n00:04:59 Speaker 2\nOK, alright. But. All right. All right, Speaker 1, that's great. Are any music or movies that you like to watch or listen to?\n00:05:15 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:05:16 Speaker 2\nMusic. Yeah. OK. Alright.\n00:05:27 Speaker 4\nMay.\n00:05:32 Speaker 2\nSo I kind of got a little bit. So the next question is of course what kind of technology or tools you use? To UM currently use for for these uh entertainment activities, so definitely there's TV.\n00:05:51 Speaker 1\nMHM.\n00:05:52 Speaker 2\nRight, what else? Xbox.\n00:05:59 Speaker 1\nUh.\n00:06:00 Speaker 2\nUh, how about what? What else? Do you use? Do you use your? Phones or computer?\n00:06:08 Speaker 1\nYeah, I do.\n00:06:09 Speaker 2\nPhone. OK. And and your iPad maybe?\n00:06:14 Speaker 3\nNeither the phone or the iPad.\n00:06:16 Speaker 2\nAlright, yeah. Phone or the iPad either. Or for. Uh, those things. OK, perfect. All right. Right. So now we're going to come up with scenarios like we did last time. To sort of. Those are the scenarios we're gonna we're gonna use to set up your Speaker 4 commands for entertainment. So for example, like, I want to listen to. And ice hockey game. Or something like that. Like you know the things. That you can say to Speaker 4. So that it could play it for you. Oh. Or you could, you know, listen to it or ask questions. Play games. Uh, any of that on it. So let's come up with those kind of scenarios. All right, So what would the first one be here?\n00:07:20 Speaker 3\nYou want to listen to a game, Speaker 1 on TV. How would you feel about doing that?\n00:07:26 Speaker 1\nPut the channel.\n00:07:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:07:29 Speaker 1\nWatch it.\n00:07:30 Speaker 3\nOK, so to figure out what channel it's on. What could you do?\n00:07:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, what channel is ice hockey on?\n00:07:38 Speaker 2\nOK. So what channel is iPhone?\n00:07:45 Speaker 4\nSports Network.\n00:07:46 Speaker 2\nOK. Is that?\n00:07:47 Speaker 3\nIt just came.\n00:07:47 Speaker 2\nCorrect. Yeah.\n00:07:51 Speaker 3\nIt must be a repeat, yeah.\n00:07:52 Speaker 4\nI think there's more related to that.\n00:07:56 Speaker 2\nAlright so so I would say here.\n00:07:57 Speaker 5\nYeah.\n00:08:02 Speaker 2\nI want to. Ask Speaker 4. About. The channel.\n00:08:14 Speaker 4\nSomething. Say it again, yeah.\n00:08:17 Speaker 3\nShould I mute her?\n00:08:18 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, I would. Sorry about that. Muted on all right? What else? What? What other scenario can you think of, Speaker 1? Would you wanna play or would you maybe wanna listen to the highlights? Would you wanna listen to, like highlights of a game from, like, from an ice hockey game or something on on your devices? No. OK, OK. What kind of music would you, would you say you want to?\n00:08:45 Speaker 3\nBroke up.\n00:09:01 Speaker 1\nNipsey High School and Kendrick Lamar.\n00:09:04 Speaker 2\nOK. All right.\n00:09:10 Speaker 3\nRight.\n00:09:10 Speaker 2\nListen to. Music. From particular.\n00:09:21 Speaker 1\nArtists.\n00:09:22 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright.\n00:09:25 Speaker 2\nWhat else do you think you would want to play games on it like how you're playing video games on your Xbox? You can also play games with your Speaker 4 device. Do you think that would be something you would like to do?\n00:09:41 Speaker 1\nYeah, probably.\n00:09:43 Speaker 2\nAlright, so play. Games using.\n00:09:51 Speaker 1\nLot of stuff.\n00:09:51 Speaker 2\nI very. Stimuli and feedback.\n00:09:58 Speaker 4\nAll right.\n00:10:00 Speaker 2\nAre there any particular? Games that you like to play.\n00:10:06 Speaker 3\nYou used to.\n00:10:07 Speaker 2\nAnybody have shined of like, maybe you know how some of those games had, like, they're related to words or some are?\n00:10:07 Speaker 3\nA lot of.\n00:10:14 Speaker 2\nYou know, it's like jeopardy or some are guessing games, things like that. Like is there, is there anything in particular that you like?\n00:10:24 Speaker 1\nOhh.\n00:10:25 Speaker 2\nNo. OK all right. Alright. How about anything related to like a movie? Would you like to hear dialogues or anything?\n00:10:38 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:10:39 Speaker 2\nI.\n00:10:40 Speaker 3\nWould like to you used to listen to or go to a lot of movies and watch a lot of movies.\n00:10:45 Speaker 1\nYeah, I did.\n00:10:49 Speaker 3\nWhat about listening to a series on Netflix, for example? Is that possible?\n00:10:55 Speaker 2\nYeah, that is possible. Once you have your Netflix app downloaded on your device, you just need to sync it with your username and password and you can always say like UM, you know, OK, hi, hey. Like so like, you know, play such and such theories on Netflix and it will play.\n00:11:13 Speaker 3\nOK. Is that something Speaker 1, did you used to watch Netflix a lot? Yeah. OK, So what? Can put at my account on there for him. Is that correct?\n00:11:25 Speaker 2\nYeah you can alright. Listen to Netflix series, OK? All right. Anything else that you can think?\n00:11:37 Speaker 2\nOf or. That's about it.\n00:11:39 Speaker 1\nThat's about it.\n00:11:40 Speaker 2\nHi all right. Well. Speaker 1, you did pretty good on the on the appointment that you just set for Speaker 4, it was perfect.\n00:11:52 Speaker 1\nThanks.\n00:11:53 Speaker 2\nOh, OK alright so. We're just waiting to be done. With this part. And then we'll go back to the main room and we'll practice some commands. As a group. And then we'll also do some commands individually in the breakout room again.\n00:12:20 Speaker 3\nYou had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you thinking of like? Are you? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely?\n00:12:51 Speaker 2\nDifferent. So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills which are. Teams and which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that, with the. So definitely that and then.\n00:13:07 Speaker 3\nYour voice. Where might I find the list of of those types of games?\n00:13:15 Speaker 2\nSo if you like, just go. If you go on Amazon app like the Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games. And it it it has like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like it. They have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal, things like that which are very, very familiar. Of course that. OK.\n00:13:48 Speaker 2\nThose are part of the TV so, but there are different other things as well so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n00:13:56 Speaker 3\nVoice. I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated.\n00:13:59 Speaker 2\nYes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n00:14:02 Speaker 3\nThen. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n00:14:20 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n00:14:25 Speaker 3\nAs well, uh, that would be awesome.\n00:14:28 Speaker 2\nThere with him.\n00:14:29 Speaker 3\nFor example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n00:15:09 Speaker 2\nIt it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n00:15:24 Speaker 2\nSo, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n00:15:52 Speaker 3\nHey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n00:16:00 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:07 Speaker 3\nI don't think she heard you.\n00:16:09 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n00:16:14 Speaker 4\nWhat's the reminder for?\n00:16:20 Speaker 1\nThe beach tomorrow.\n00:16:23 Speaker 4\nWhen should I remind you?\n00:16:25 Speaker 1\n9:30.\n00:16:27 Speaker 4\nOK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n00:16:30 Speaker 1\nThank you, Speaker 4.\n00:16:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n00:16:36 Speaker 1\nHello.\n00:16:37 Speaker 2\nOhh that's amazing. OK.\n00:16:39 Speaker 3\nAlright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n00:16:45 Speaker 2\nYeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n00:17:14 Speaker 3\nYes.\n00:17:15 Speaker 2\nYeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n00:17:21 Speaker 2\nAll right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n00:17:30 Speaker 3\nThank you for your help.\n00:17:31 Speaker 2\nAbsolutely, yeah. See you there. OK. All right. Hey, Speaker 1. Alright, OK, let me share my screen again so we can pick what we want to do next. Alright, Speaker 1, so this is pretty straightforward. Would you like to play some music next? Or would you like to do a joke?\n00:18:11 Speaker 1\nA joke.\n00:18:12 Speaker 2\nA joke. OK, alright. Let me go to that slide then directly and then we'll see if time permits, we can come back for some.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\nTranscript not listed. \n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:18:23 Speaker 1\nMusic.\n00:18:24 Speaker 2\nSome music, right? All right. So with the jokes, you can be pretty specific or you can have a general like you know, just tell me a. Joke sort of command. So you can either say like Speaker 4 tell me a joke, Speaker 4, tell me, like, uh, Star Trek joke, Speaker 4. Tell me a Doctor Who joke anything that you like can can can be a joke like that. So sorry, sorry about that. Yeah. So is there anything specific that you want to say or would you like to just? Try a joke.\n00:19:08 Speaker 1\nJust try a joke.\n00:19:09 Speaker 2\nOK. All right. Right. Go ahead then. You can say, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:15 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, tell me a joke.\n00:19:20 Speaker 4\nHere's a Despicable Me joke just for you. Why did the minions give blue banana peels for his birthday? He needed some new slippers.\n00:19:33 Speaker 2\nAll right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n00:19:36 Speaker 4\nSounds like.\n00:19:45 Speaker 2\nThat was perfect, Speaker 1. OK.\n00:19:47 Speaker 1\nYeah.\n00:19:49 Speaker 2\nYeah. Alright, let's see. So you also have some funny questions that you want to ask is there like, you know, umm, something like Speaker 4? Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n00:20:18 Speaker 1\nYeah, well. Hey, Speaker 4. Are you blue?\n00:20:25 Speaker 4\nOnly my light ring, only my light ring.\n00:20:30 Speaker 3\nOnly my light ring.\n00:20:32 Speaker 2\nOK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n00:21:50 Speaker 4\nSo.\n00:21:52 Speaker 2\nAny song I I have like Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline here, but it can be any song that you want to listen to Speaker 1.\n00:22:02 Speaker 3\nPick a clean one.\n00:22:04 Speaker 1\nNipsey hussle.\n00:22:07 Speaker 3\nIt's not that clean.\n00:22:09 Speaker 1\nThere's not.\n00:22:15 Speaker 4\nRight.\n00:22:15 Speaker 2\nIt can be anything, Speaker 1.\n00:22:18 Speaker 3\nWhatever you want, just go.\n00:22:18 Speaker 1\nI gotta clean the system.\n00:22:22 Speaker 3\nYou have to. Who are you talking to?\n00:22:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can I get it cleaned up? See song.\n00:22:29 Speaker 4\nFrom Drugs.com. Clean it with the cotton ball or cotton pad that is wet with warm water.\n00:22:37 Speaker 3\nI don't think she understood you.\n00:22:38 Speaker 2\nYeah, she didn't understand you there, so. Try try again maybe. Is that the name of the song?\n00:22:50 Speaker 3\nNo, just ask for a Nipsey.\n00:22:51 Speaker 1\nNo.\n00:22:51 Speaker 3\nSong.\n00:22:52 Speaker 2\nOh yeah.\n00:22:52 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4.\n00:22:57 Speaker 4\nI couldn't find any songs by Nipsey in your library to play 10s of millions of songs. Check out Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:06 Speaker 2\nI think like with the default that they have, it may not have it in the library once you have. UM an app or like a streaming service that's already logged into or something? Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n00:23:29 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:23:30 Speaker 2\nYeah you can.\n00:23:32 Speaker 3\nThat's a common song living on a. Prayer do that.\n00:23:35 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, play living on a prayer. By Bon Jovi.\n00:23:40 Speaker 4\nTo play a specific song, you'll need to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:23:45 Speaker 2\nHey. So Speaker 1, I guess.\n00:23:49 Speaker 4\n$5.99 a month containing cancel. Turns in the Speaker 4 app. Should I sign you up and play living? On a prayer.\n00:23:56 Speaker 3\nSo say not, right?\n00:23:58 Speaker 2\nYeah, I think you might have to like log into Amazon Music and then it will let you like sort of pick and choose. Alright, Speaker 1, how about we we just do the command that we have here. I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n00:24:20 Speaker 1\nSweet Caroline.\n00:24:23 Speaker 3\nTell.\n00:24:24 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play sweet Caroline?\n00:24:28 Speaker 3\nOne SEC. Just tell Speaker 4.\n00:24:31 Speaker 4\nMusic station based on Steve, Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n00:24:35 Speaker 2\nThere you go.\n00:24:39 Speaker 3\nThere you go.\n00:24:42 Speaker 2\nYeah. All right. Is it playing?\n00:24:45 Speaker 3\nIt is.\n00:24:47 Speaker 2\nOK, perfect. All right. Do you want to? Do the volume or maybe do you want to try fast forwarding it or something? Maybe we haven't tried that command.\n00:24:54 Speaker 3\nStop.\n00:25:02 Speaker 1\nThat we have.\n00:25:03 Speaker 2\nOK, so let's say Speaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:08 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, Fast forward 10 seconds.\n00:25:15 Speaker 4\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:19 Speaker 3\nI cannot Fast forward this stream.\n00:25:22 Speaker 2\nReally. Yeah. That's so odd.\n00:25:27 Speaker 1\nYeah, it is.\n00:25:29 Speaker 3\nIt could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n00:25:41 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n00:25:47 Speaker 3\nIt did the opposite.\n00:25:50 Speaker 2\nYeah. Across.\n00:25:54 Speaker 3\nGive it how many times?\n00:25:56 Speaker 1\nThat's the volume up by 3.\n00:26:00 Speaker 4\nAnd no so. If I.\n00:26:12 Speaker 3\nSpeaker 1, volume down two times.\n00:26:15 Speaker 1\nSpeaker 4, volume down two times.\n00:26:20 Speaker 3\nYeah.\n00:26:22 Speaker 2\nIt did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n00:26:33 Speaker 1\nHey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n00:26:42 Speaker 3\nNo. Try again.\n00:26:44 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n00:26:51 Speaker 3\nAgain.\n00:26:53 Speaker 1\nHey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n00:26:57 Speaker 4\nStarting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n00:27:01 Speaker 2\nOhh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n00:27:34 Speaker 3\nSo you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n00:27:45 Speaker 2\nTo it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n00:27:47 Speaker 3\nOK.\n00:27:51 Speaker 2\nDefinitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n00:28:25 Speaker 3\nThe one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n00:28:36 Speaker 2\nYes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n00:28:56 Speaker 3\nRight, right.\n00:28:56 Speaker 2\nI think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n00:29:38 Speaker 1\nOK.\n00:29:42 Speaker 2\nHave to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n00:29:51 Speaker 1\nYeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n00:30:09 Speaker 2\nBut OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n00:31:13 Speaker 3\nYou know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n00:32:03 Speaker 2\nYeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n00:32:04 Speaker 5\nAbility.\n00:32:15 Speaker 3\nOK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n00:32:19 Speaker 2\nIt's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n00:32:28 Speaker 3\nYeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n00:32:46 Speaker 2\nRight, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n00:33:02 Speaker 6\nYou mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n00:33:03 Speaker 2\nOhh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n00:33:08 Speaker 6\nNo, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n00:34:00 Speaker 3\nI do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n00:34:30 Speaker 2\nIt's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n00:34:52 Speaker 3\nYou never know with all the AI so.\n00:34:55 Speaker 2\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n00:34:57 Speaker 1\nM.\n00:35:00 Speaker 2\nAll right. OK. Right. So I guess that's about it. Stop sharing. All right. Is there anything else, Speaker 1 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or anything related? To today's session. Or in general with Speaker 4.\n00:35:32 Speaker 3\nI don't think it yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 1's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch back to our house so it worked out because. Speaker 1 was living in Kansas prior to, you know.\n00:35:53 Speaker 2\nOK, OK, OK. OK. Sure. Makes sense. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help. You. With any of those.\n00:36:14 Speaker 3\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n00:36:19 Speaker 2\nYeah, absolutely. All right, Speaker 1, great job today. I really enjoyed working with you.\n00:36:29 Speaker 3\nThat's a fist bump, Speaker 1. There you go.\n00:36:31 Speaker 2\nAll right. Perfect. There you go.\n00:36:36 Speaker 2\nAll right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main waiting main room or what should we do?\n00:36:50 Speaker 6\nLet me sleep.\n00:36:53 Speaker 2\nMaybe leave books and go to the main room.\n00:36:54 Speaker 3\nLook to see. Oh.\n00:36:57 Speaker 6\nYou know, yeah, we, I guess we could go.\n00:36:59 Speaker 6\nBecause I or.\n00:37:02 Speaker 6\nI I don't know if people left or.\n00:37:04 Speaker 6\nPeople went back, yeah.\n00:37:06 Speaker 2\nNo.\n00:37:12 Speaker 6\nGina's group is back in the main.\n00:37:13 Speaker 2\nOh yeah, there we go. We can. So we can leave this room and go back to the main room and then we can, yeah, we we should be done for the night. Yeah.\n00:37:23 Speaker 6\nAlright, thank you so.\n00:37:23 Speaker 3\nAlright.\n00:37:24 Speaker 2\nMuch thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely.\n00:37:25 Speaker 6\nFor the recommendations.\n00:37:29\nRight.\n00:37:30 Speaker 3\nSo we just click leave room.\n00:37:32 Speaker 2\nYeah, we need the breakout room and then.\n------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n00:37:35 Speaker 3\nHey.\n00:37:43 Speaker 5\nHey. Speaker 1, we have friends who are still work working on their things, Frank is working on how to make Speaker 4 slow down and listen to listen to him more. Cause Speaker 4 is too quick for him. So we did have that. Lucy, you're very up to speed with your old Ziggy and Speaker 1. You're a rock star. I saw how you were doing all the cool stuff. So. If you're done, we just wanna say bye and give the other friends a little bit more time. Yes. Question Lucy.\n00:38:19 Speaker 7\nBye.\n00:38:19 Speaker 3\nBut.\n00:38:21 Speaker 5\nOhh bye. Ohh Lucy. I did want to say. UM, we sent you homework in the homework. There is a video. So let me drop so can someone find the link in the the homework link and then drop back here one more time. So want you to make sure you do the homework for week. One, because we do ask you to record a little interaction and then type. Comment.\n00:38:49 Speaker 7\nDidn't see the homework.\n00:38:51 Speaker 5\nLike, OK, we'll send it to you one more time if someone can drop the link here so you can actually open it up. It's probably easier you do it on your phone. So I don't know if you actually have your e-mail in your phone or how can we manage to get it to you. And then Speaker 3, this is a Qualtrics survey you probably have seen some type of version. So Speaker 1 and Speaker 3, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you. Just got your device, so take your time on this one. This week we'll send you another one on your entertainment one. So in the middle of the week, probably by the weekend, we'll send you another one. So you can just work on practicing with some guidance. I will send you all the slides in case you wanted to go through the whole slide and complete the training.\n00:39:48 Speaker 7\nWhere are you sending the link for me? And.\n00:39:53 Speaker 5\nSo. It's in the chat, Lucy, but I don't know. Do you have e-mail set up on your phone or on your computer? Do you where do you get your emails?\n00:40:08 Speaker 7\nOn my phone and on my iPad. Ohh I didn't get the link.\n00:40:14 Speaker 5\nOK, so we have it here in the chat. I don't know if you can see the chat on your iPad, but I can e-mail it again to your e-mail about the homework from last week. So you can either. Open it on your iPad, on your phone, and then you can just do the survey on your iPad. If it asks you to record, you can like record with your with your iPad. That's pretty easy because it's got a camera too.\n00:40:41 Speaker 7\nOK, I didn't get the link.\n00:40:45 Speaker 5\nOK, e-mail you. Right now so you can have it and there will be another one. So just make sure you check your emails, OK?\n00:40:56 Speaker 3\nSo then we'll just send in the two the this link that you sent that Speaker 2 sent in the chat that I can't pronounce it. The QUADRA survey, that one. So we said that we filled that one in for this week as well as the second one that you're going to send later on in the week.\n00:41:09 Speaker 5\nQualtrics. Yeah. For the entertainment. So the current one is about reminders, scheduling reminders. So you can just share some feedback on what you explored. And Speaker 2 had a little teaching recording as well for you.\n00:41:31 Speaker 3\nPerfect.\n00:41:32 Speaker 5\nHere is the homework for week 1. Hey Rosie, I was just sharing with people. This is your homework for week 1. I don't know if you got a chance. Duet so fill this in about reminders and scheduling things. We will send you another one for this week's topic in the so you can practice something and record back to us so see how you did. OK, have a good. Have a good week and I'll see you on next Thursday. Bye. OK.\n00:42:08 Speaker 3\nBye bye. Thank you.\n00:42:11 Speaker 1\nSee you later on.\n00:42:28 Speaker 5\nOK. Lucy has Tina.\n00:42:34 Speaker 3\nAgnes.\n00:42:56 Speaker 5\nRosie, did you get the homework link as e-mail?\n00:42:58 Speaker 6\nYeah, I thought I saved it to my laptop.\n00:43:01 Speaker 5\nOK, perfect. OK, see you next Thursday.\n00:43:05 Speaker 3\nBye.\n00:43:09 Speaker 6\nSorry, I was going to leave too, but I just wanted to say I.

OK, who is? I was.\n, \n    ensuring it includes all relevant details from the conversation and follows the structure and style described in the provided rubric : Introduction\nThe Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note is an acronym representing a widely used method of documentation for healthcare providers. The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow.?  </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> **SOAP Note**\n\n**Patient:** M.  \n**Date:** 07-18-2024  \n**Clinician:** [Clinician's Name]  \n**Session Type:** 1:1 Individual Session  \n\n---\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n**Chief Complaint (CC):** Patient M. is participating in a session to improve interaction with their Alexa device for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  \n- Patient M. is a [age] year-old [gender] who is learning to use their Alexa device for reminders and entertainment. \n- The patient expressed satisfaction with their ability to set reminders independently, stating, \"I'm pretty happy.\"\n- Patient enjoys watching sports, particularly ice hockey, and playing video games.

The use of auditory games indicates an adaptation to their visual impairment.\n\n2. **Problem 2:** Engagement in leisure activities.\n   - **Differential Diagnosis:** \n     - Limited access to adaptive technology for entertainment.\n   - **Discussion:** Patient M. enjoys sports and video games, indicating a need for continued support in accessing these activities through adaptive technology.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Technology Training:**\n   - Continue to practice setting reminders and using Alexa for entertainment.\n   - Explore additional auditory games compatible with the Alexa device to enhance engagement.\n\n2. **Patient Education:**\n   - Educate the caregiver on how to assist the patient in using the Alexa device effectively, including setting up streaming services for music and games.\n   - Discuss the importance of pausing after saying \"Alexa\" to improve command recognition.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up session to assess progress with the Alexa device and explore new features or skills that can be added.\n   - Encourage the caregiver to provide feedback on the patient's engagement and any challenges faced.\n\n4. **Resources:**\n   - Provide a list of accessible games and entertainment options for visually impaired individuals.\n   - Suggest exploring streaming services that may offer a wider range of music and audio content.\n\n---\n\n**Signature:**  \n[Clinician's Name]  \n[Clinician's Title]  \n[Date] </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt and better align the language model's output with the objective function, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Explicitly Define the Focus Areas**: The system prompt should explicitly instruct the language model to focus on specific information-seeking goals related to the Olympics and the 2024 presidential election. This can be achieved by including a directive to prioritize these topics when generating the SOAP note, ensuring that the model captures the patient's interest and progress in these areas.\n\n2. **Incorporate Measurable Goals**: The prompt should guide the model to include specific, measurable goals in the SOAP note. This can be done by instructing the model to identify and document quantifiable outcomes, such as the accuracy of voice commands or the frequency of successful information retrieval related to the target topics.\n\n3. **Emphasize Detailed Assessment**: The prompt should encourage the model to provide a detailed assessment of the patient's engagement with the specified topics. This can be achieved by instructing the model to include metrics, trial results, or specific examples of the patient's performance in using voice commands to seek information about the Olympics and the presidential election.\n\n4. **Outline Specific Plans and Strategies**: The prompt should guide the model to outline specific tasks or strategies for the patient to work on, such as homework assignments or metacognitive strategies related to the target topics. This will help the model generate a plan that mirrors the target note's approach and provides a clear path for the patient's continued development.\n\n5. **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Structure**: The prompt should instruct the model to adopt the terminology and structure used in the target note. This includes avoiding terms like \"Chief Complaint\" and \"History of Present Illness\" if they are not present in the target note, ensuring consistency in format and reducing the loss score.\n\n6. **Highlight Contextual Relevance**: The prompt should emphasize the importance of contextually relevant content, guiding the model to focus on the use of Alexa for specific information-seeking tasks rather than general entertainment and leisure activities. This can be achieved by instructing the model to prioritize content that aligns with the session's objectives and the patient's goals.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt can be improved to guide the language model's reasoning strategy more effectively, resulting in a SOAP note that better matches the target note and achieves the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt to guide the LLM's reasoning strategy for accurate responses) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}
