The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay.

Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3.

You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Subjective (S):**\nThe patient, L.V.G., an 81-year-old, participated in the virtual session independently. L.V.G. expresses challenges with language, specifically in word retrieval and speaking fluency, consistent with her self-reported aphasia from PPA (Primary Progressive Aphasia). Despite these speech difficulties, she is confident in her cognitive abilities for reading, writing, and daily tasks. She expressed frustration about a previous speech therapy session in January that did not alleviate her speech issues. L.V.G. plays bridge and engages in water coloring, indicating her interest in activities that stimulate cognitive function. She acknowledges communication is easier in the mornings, with speech declining as the day progresses.\n\n**Objective (O):**\nA comprehensive cognitive and communication assessment was conducted, involving tasks requiring repetition, memory recall, and category naming. L.V.G. demonstrated variable performance, with strengths in recalling categories but some difficulties in recalling sequences of words and numbers. The patient showed awareness of her mistakes and corrected herself appropriately. During a trial of short-term memory and orientation tasks, L.V.G. correctly identified seasons, holidays, and geographic locations. She participated in a word generation task by naming multiple animals, fruits, and states, but noted difficulty with abstract tasks such as naming words that start with specific letters. \n\n**Assessment (A):**\nL.V.G. presents with symptoms consistent with Primary Progressive Aphasia, showing a predominant difficulty in word retrieval and verbal fluency but maintains good comprehension and cognitive function in structured tasks. Despite verbal expression challenges, she displays strong compensatory strategies and cognitive function in other domains. L.V.G. is highly independent with current technology for daily living tasks but expresses a need for improved verbal communication to be understood better by others, including during phone conversations. Her ability to perform voice-activated tasks with Speaker 3 (Alexa) appears promising, with independence in executing most commands anticipated once familiar with the device.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n- Continue exploring technology-assisted communication solutions, focusing on using Speaker 3 for daily organization and engagement.\n- Implement training sessions tailored to increase familiarity and efficiency with Speaker 3, especially voice-activated tasks that improve autonomy in daily activities.\n- Encourage frequent practice in conversational and word retrieval tasks through therapeutic exercises.\n- Reassess speech therapy potential with a focus on functional communication strategies, addressing L.V.G.'s specific challenges in spontaneous speech.\n- Develop a home exercise program utilizing Speaker 3 to set reminders, schedule appointments, and facilitate daily tasks with vocal commands.\n- Schedule follow-up sessions to monitor progress and adjust interventions to maximize patient independence and confidence in communication.\n- Support L.V.G.'s interest in activities stimulating cognitive engagement, such as bridge playing and painting, and explore additional activities that promote cognitive resilience.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's self-reported symptoms and experiences, including her challenges with language and previous speech therapy. It effectively captures her cognitive abilities and interests, offering a clear context for her condition. However, it could benefit from more specific details about her daily living challenges and emotional state.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the cognitive and communication assessment well, highlighting the patient's strengths and weaknesses. It includes specific tasks and the patient's performance, which is crucial for understanding her condition. However, it lacks detailed quantitative data or specific scores from the assessments, which would provide a clearer picture of her abilities.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment accurately identifies the patient's condition and symptoms, providing a clear diagnosis of Primary Progressive Aphasia. It discusses her compensatory strategies and cognitive function, which is essential for planning treatment. However, it could be improved by including a more detailed differential diagnosis and potential progression of her condition.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and comprehensive, addressing the patient's needs for technology-assisted communication and speech therapy. It includes specific interventions and follow-up plans, which are crucial for her ongoing care. The plan also supports her cognitive engagement through activities, which is a positive aspect. However, it could be enhanced by specifying the frequency and duration of the proposed interventions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright!

Gabar.\n \n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.670\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Alright alright! What was the 1st thing you did this morning?\n \n00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.050\nSpeaker 1: Got out of bed and took a drank of water.\n \n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.720\nSpeaker 2: alright! What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay. What what year is it?\n \n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.590\nSpeaker 1: 2,024.\n \n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.959\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what season are we in.\n \n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.010\nSpeaker 1: Summer.\n \n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.230\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What? Okay that you told me already. What is our next month?\n \n00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.990\nSpeaker 1: August.\n \n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.520\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nL.V.G., an 81-year-old female, participated in a virtual session to assess her needs related to scheduling, reminders, and communication. Her primary concerns include difficulty in speaking clearly due to rapid deterioration of her articulation, which affects communication with her husband, who has hearing difficulties. She maintains a busy schedule, predominantly using a physical calendar to track appointments, such as therapy, social activities, and healthcare visits, but also uses a phone and tablet occasionally for specific tasks like setting alarms and finding locations. L.V.G. expressed interest in utilizing technology, particularly Alexa, to assist with reminders, communication, and potentially emergency situations despite her unfamiliarity with its capabilities.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \n- **Current Technology Use:**  \n  - Prefers a physical calendar for scheduling.  \n  - Uses a phone for setting alarms and scheduling appointments.  \n  - Occasionally uses a tablet to find locations and information.\n  \n- **Scheduling and Reminder Needs:**  \n  - Sees a therapist weekly and has various other health and social appointments.  \n  - Recommends having Alexa help with reminders for appointments, medication management, and groceries.  \n  \n- **Communication Needs:**  \n  - Difficulty speaking and articulating words clearly due to rapid deterioration.  \n  - Interest in using Alexa to assist with communicating with her husband and potentially in emergency situations.\n\n- **Training Scenario Needs:**  \n  - L.V.G. voiced her wish to set reminders for personal and household activities, e.g., pickup prescriptions, family visits, cleaning services, and social gatherings.\n  \n- **Emergency Preparedness:**  \n  - Concerned about communicating during emergencies, expressed interest in using Alexa, though currently relies on neighbors for emergencies.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nL.V.G. successfully articulated her needs and the potential areas where technology could enhance her daily management of tasks. While she is primarily comfortable with traditional methods, the potential for integrating Alexa into her routine could provide significant benefits, particularly in reminders and communication. Her rapid articulation deterioration presents a substantial barrier, which might be augmented by voice-aided technology like Alexa, offering a promising solution for managing her daily schedule and enhancing communication with her husband.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n1. **Continue Training:**  \n   - Focus on helping L.V.G. become familiar with Alexa's features and capabilities.  \n   - Schedule-focused tasks initially to incorporate for daily routines and reminders.\n\n2. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Educate L.V.G. about Alexa\u2019s capabilities for managing lists, alarms, and simple emergencies to bridge her current unfamiliarity.\n\n3. **Communication Strategy:**  \n   - Develop strategies using Alexa to assist with articulation and communication, potentially storing set phrases or commands for easier verbalization to her husband.\n\n4. **Emergency Plan:**\n   - Explore setting up Alexa\u2019s emergency assist feature, maintaining the existing back-up plan of contacting neighbors if technology options are not feasible.\n\n5. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Task L.V.G. with attempting to set simple reminders or alarms using Alexa to build confidence and familiarity.\n   - Use scenarios such as setting alarms for picking up medications, scheduling cleaning services, and planning social activities.\n\n6. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Regularly check-in to track L.V.G.\u2019s progress and comfort level with technology.\n   - Adjust training needs based on her feedback and newly acquired technological skills.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's primary concerns, including her difficulty with articulation and her interest in using technology to assist with daily tasks. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about her medical history, social history, and specific examples of how her communication difficulties impact her daily life.\n\n**Objective (O):** 6/10  \nThe objective section outlines the patient's current use of technology and her needs for scheduling and communication. It mentions her preference for a physical calendar and her occasional use of a phone and tablet. However, it lacks specific details about her physical exam findings, vital signs, or any diagnostic data that might be relevant to her condition.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment effectively synthesizes the subjective and objective information, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating Alexa into the patient's routine. It acknowledges the challenges posed by her articulation difficulties and suggests that voice-aided technology could be a promising solution. The assessment is well-reasoned but could be strengthened by including a differential diagnosis or discussing other potential interventions.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and addresses multiple aspects of the patient's needs, including training, patient education, communication strategies, and emergency preparedness. It provides clear and actionable steps for helping the patient become more comfortable with using Alexa. The plan is well-structured and aligns with the assessment, but it could be improved by specifying a timeline for follow-up and evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note for L.V.G. User Needs Assessment (07-25-2024, Week 2)**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nThe participant, L.V.G., expressed difficulty in speaking during the session due to the time of the day (7:30 PM). Despite the challenge, L.V.G. actively engaged in the session involving the use of the Alexa device for various tasks. She mentioned having received and set up the device but encountered difficulties with changing the Wi-Fi settings, adjusting the display to show only the time, and changing the wake-up word. She showed a preference for using the wake-up word \"Speaker 4,\" as it was easier for her to pronounce.

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you.

That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training.

Remove a stain out of a fabric. \n \n00:41:56.580 --> 0:42:07.260 \nSpeaker 1: I already know that I'm doing everything on there already. \n \n00:42:07.260 --> 0:42:09.959 \nSpeaker 2: Without without any help from anyone. \n \n00:42:10.300 --> 0:42:11.110 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:42:11.340 --> 0:42:23.090 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, everything like treating migraine. If you had one, all of that, you think would be a 2 right. If you if you needed any help you would be able to ask Speaker 3 on your own. \n \n00:42:23.490 --> 0:42:24.210 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:42:24.480 --> 0:42:31.010 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. So do you think all of these are 2? Then finding like, Okay, alright, okay. Sounds. \n \n00:42:31.010 --> 0:42:34.940 \nSpeaker 1: I'm a nurse, I where treat myself. \n \n00:42:35.840 --> 0:42:38.970 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Oh, okay, that means a lot. \n \n00:42:38.970 --> 0:42:39.600 \nSpeaker 1: Britain. \n \n00:42:39.880 --> 0:42:40.790 \nSpeaker 2: Right. \n \n00:42:41.180 --> 0:42:56.910 \nSpeaker 1: Finding amount of health. I have a therapist treating an itch, finding a dermatology. I have all of those done. They accept their products. \n \n00:42:57.260 --> 0:42:57.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:42:57.740 --> 0:43:00.009 \nSpeaker 1: I find everything. \n \n00:43:00.220 --> 0:43:16.020 \nSpeaker 2: Find everything. Okay. Alright. So I'm gonna mark all of those as twos. and then we'll move on to meal preparation. So, finding a meal using. Speaker 3. You think. \n \n00:43:16.020 --> 0:43:18.728 \nSpeaker 1: I already know how to cook. \n \n00:43:19.671 --> 0:43:39.580 \nSpeaker 2: Say you were in a different say, maybe you were in a different, you know, place or like, you know, you're traveling or something, and you needed, you know, to find a meal outside. Do you think you would be able to use Speaker 3 independently to find them find a find, a meal. or find a restaurant. \n \n00:43:40.580 --> 0:43:42.149 \nSpeaker 1: I use my phone. \n \n00:43:42.910 --> 0:43:45.080 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. But. \n \n00:43:45.633 --> 0:43:49.510 \nSpeaker 1: Lexa. I won't have it with me. \n \n00:43:50.360 --> 0:44:00.229 \nSpeaker 2: Right? So that's the good part about Speaker 3. You can also have a phone app of Speaker 3 on your phone. So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nSpeaker 4 attended the virtual session to discuss her goals related to medical needs and self-care. She expressed a desire to use Speaker 1 (Alexa) for reminders, especially for taking medications and attending appointments. Although she has not had significant issues with remembering appointments so far, she anticipates needing more assistance as she approaches senility. Speaker 4 reported difficulties with speech during social interactions due to aphasia, which affects her ability to communicate clearly on the phone without her husband's assistance. She uses a medication sheet and a home calendar to manage her medications and appointments but is interested in integrating technology more into her self-care routine.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nUser needs assessment was conducted through a Q&A format focusing on managing self-care and health-related needs with technology. \n- Current tools: Medication sheet, physical calendar.\n- Not using phone calendars but uses Speaker 1 for verbal reminders.\n- Practiced using Speaker 1 for reminders and setting commands: Successfully learned how to ask Speaker 1 to set reminders for medications and other events, though difficulty with continuous commands was noted.\n- Practiced using YouTube on Alexa for playing specific music, although faced challenges with interruptions and the specificity of commands.\n- Discussed potential to use Alexa for ordering medications, although concerns about verbal clarity were mentioned. Practiced voice commands to set reminders, cancel reminders, and practice using the YouTube function for music.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nThe participant actively participated in practicing using Alexa for reminders and music but needed scaffolding and practice to complete commands accurately. She anticipates increased reliance on Alexa in the future for managing tasks. Despite the challenges posed by aphasia, the participant successfully interacted with Alexa to set specific reminders, demonstrating improvement in command structuring. However, consistent interruptions from Alexa during commands indicate an opportunity for further learning and adaptation of her communication style to better suit the device\u2019s recognition capabilities.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \nSpeaker 4 will continue practicing using Alexa to enhance independence with reminders and managing daily activities, focusing particularly on:\n- Setting reminders for daily medications and personal care tasks (e.g., washing hair).\n- Practicing precise and clear voice commands for better interaction with Alexa.\n- Exploring the capability of ordering medications through Alexa despite current verbal challenges.\n- Consider potential use of Alexa for more complex tasks like setting up appointments or accessing services like music streaming without physical intervention.  \n- For homework, Speaker 4 should continue practicing setting and canceling reminders using Alexa to improve proficiency with these tasks.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's current situation, including her goals and challenges. It effectively captures her desire to integrate technology into her self-care routine and her difficulties with speech due to aphasia. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about her medical history and specific examples of how aphasia affects her daily life.\n\n**Objective (O):** 6/10  \nThe objective section outlines the tools and practices the patient currently uses and her experience with using Alexa. It mentions the assessment conducted but lacks specific data or observations from the session, such as the patient's ability to follow commands or any measurable outcomes from the practice sessions.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 7/10  \nThe assessment identifies the patient's progress and challenges in using Alexa, highlighting her improvement in command structuring despite aphasia. It provides a good synthesis of the subjective and objective information but could be more detailed in explaining the specific areas where the patient needs further support or adaptation.\n\n**Plan (P):** 8/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and outlines specific actions for the patient to continue practicing with Alexa. It includes clear goals for enhancing independence and suggests homework to improve proficiency. However, it could be strengthened by including a timeline for follow-up or additional resources to support the patient's learning.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something.

I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

Are you ready. \n \n00:33:12.760 --> 0:33:13.165 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:33:13.570 --> 0:33:42.610 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, here it is. Anna's husband gave her a beautiful ruby ring for her birthday that night she decided to wear the rain, but she couldn't find it. Anna searched everywhere, and then began to cry.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**  \nPatient L.V.G., an older adult, attended the virtual session with her caretaker. The primary focus was on exploring how L.V.G. could use her Alexa device to manage her daily activities, interests, and reminders, particularly for medication and other personal interests like news and sports updates. L.V.G. expressed an interest in staying updated on Olympic results, the stock market, and learning about topics such as bridge, major political issues, and historical or geographic trivia. Her caretaker assisted with executing the tasks and asked questions about Alexa's capabilities, reflecting a learning experience for both.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \n- **Technology Usage:** The session involved interacting with an Alexa device to manage a medication list and set reminders. L.V.G., with assistance, practiced adding medications (Maco Labs and Super K) and setting reminders for medication intake (e.g., taking Super K at noon daily).  \n- **Command Practice:**  \n  - Successfully added medications to the list and set daily reminders with verbal prompts from Alexa.\n  - Demonstrated difficulties with recording and stopping videos/practice logs without unintended deletions, citing technology malfunctions.\n  - Practiced asking Alexa for news updates, sports results, stock market statuses, and local traffic\u2014which Alexa partly fulfilled. Issues arose with more complex inquiries, needing more concise phrasing.\n  - Explored features like flash briefing, calendar setup (added a bridge game event), and queried about general topics (e.g., popular songs, Olympic histories, and exercises for back pain).\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nL.V.G. demonstrates adequate capacity to engage with Alexa for basic operations but requires ongoing support for more complex interactions. Her caretaker\u2019s participation is crucial in facilitating use and troubleshooting. The patient\u2019s interests indicate a broader application potential for Alexa beyond managing medications\u2014extending to recreational and informational uses. L.V.G. exhibits enthusiasm for learning about and utilizing Alexa's functionalities, which can significantly aid her daily routines and personal interests. Continuous practice and simplification of commands can enhance user experience as inconsistencies in Alexa\u2019s response were noted.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- Continue sessions focusing on simplifying commands and offering repetition in practicing essential functions like setting reminders and alarms.\n- Introduce new functions gradually, emphasizing those that align with the patient\u2019s interests (e.g., news updates, stock market information, sports).\n- Encourage L.V.G. to practice concise and clear commands to improve Alexa\u2019s responsiveness and ability to follow instructions correctly.\n- Explore additional resources or brief training sessions with L.V.G.\u2019s caretaker to further facilitate the integration of technology into daily routines.\n- Schedule a follow-up session to review progress and address any lingering technical challenges or new requests from L.V.G. and caretaker regarding Alexa's use.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's interests and the primary focus of the session. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about the patient's medical history, social history, and any specific challenges she faces with technology.\n\n**Objective (O):** 8/10  \nThe objective section is well-detailed, describing the patient's interaction with the Alexa device and the specific tasks practiced. It effectively highlights the patient's capabilities and areas of difficulty. However, it could include more specific observations about the patient's physical or cognitive state during the session.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a good synthesis of the patient's abilities and challenges with using Alexa. It identifies the need for ongoing support and highlights the potential benefits of the technology for the patient's daily life.

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see.

What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay.

She reached into her pocket for her handkerchief, and there was the ring. Okay. now you tell me the same story. Okay? Ready? \n \n00:33:42.610 --> 0:34:03.620 \nSpeaker 1: Anna's husband gave her a a ruby ring she was going to wear that night. and she couldn't find it.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3.

Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**  \nPatient L.V.G. attended the session and discussed her interactions with her voice-controlled device, \u201cSpeaker 4,\" which she renamed \"Ziggy.\" She experiences forgetfulness and uses the device for setting reminders, which she finds beneficial. She also uses the device to search for medical information, such as understanding more about essential tremors, which a friend and her husband have. The information provided by Ziggy helped alleviate some concerns. However, L.V.G. reported struggling with speech recognition, which affects her confidence and limits her usage of the device. She has noted a deterioration in her speech and overall health over recent months. Despite these challenges, she learned to make her instructions more concise and chose the wake-up word \"Ziggy\" for easier articulation.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \n- The patient uses Ziggy for reminders and information searches.\n- She has difficulties with speech recognition, affecting her device use.\n- Training included simplifying verbal commands to improve device responsiveness.\n- The patient selected \u201cZiggy\u201d as the wake word due to articulation ease.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nL.V.G. demonstrates progress in using Ziggy, leveraging it for reminders and reassurance through access to medical information. While speech recognition challenges persist, resulting in reduced usage and confidence, adaptations such as shortened commands and a more easily articulated wake word aid in mitigating these issues. Continuous support and adaptation of usage strategies are important. The speech and health decline could be impacting her device interactions, warranting further assessment or intervention.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n1. **Speech Recognition Training:** \n   - Continue practicing concise commands using Ziggy without extraneous language.\n   - Explore speech therapy options to address speech deterioration affecting confidence and device use.\n   \n2. **Device Usage Improvement:**\n   - Encourage regular use of Ziggy for reminders to improve comfort with the device.\n   - Introduce alternative interaction methods, such as touch features if available, to complement voice commands.\n\n3. **Health Monitoring:**\n   - Schedule regular check-ins to assess patient\u2019s health and speech progress.\n   - Discuss any concerns or adjustments needed to maintain effective interaction with Ziggy.\n\n4. **Support and Evaluation:**\n   - Encourage participation in support groups or peer interactions similar to Ziggy users for shared tips and experiences.\n   - Evaluate potential interventions to address overall health decline potentially impacting device utilization.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear and detailed account of the patient's experiences and challenges with the voice-controlled device. It includes relevant personal insights and the patient's adaptation strategies, which are crucial for understanding her current situation. However, it could benefit from more specific examples of how the device has impacted her daily life beyond reminders and medical information searches.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section succinctly outlines the patient's use of the device and the challenges faced, such as speech recognition issues. It mentions the training provided and the rationale behind choosing the wake word \"Ziggy.\" However, it lacks specific data or observations from the session, such as the patient's speech clarity or any quantitative measures of device usage.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment effectively synthesizes the subjective and objective information, highlighting the patient's progress and ongoing challenges. It acknowledges the impact of speech and health decline on device interaction and suggests the need for further assessment. The section could be strengthened by including a more detailed analysis of how these factors specifically affect her device usage.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and addresses key areas for improvement, including speech recognition training, device usage enhancement, health monitoring, and support. It provides actionable steps and considers the patient's overall well-being. The inclusion of alternative interaction methods and support group participation is a thoughtful addition. However, it could be improved by specifying timelines or frequency for the proposed interventions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright! Tell me what month it is now.\n \n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.240\nSpeaker 1: July.\n \n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.419\nSpeaker 2: What day of the week is it today.\n \n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.180\nSpeaker 1: Tuesday.\n \n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.340\nSpeaker 2: Who is your doctor?\n \n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.550\nSpeaker 1: I have multiple doctors have health issues. Gabar.\n \n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.670\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Alright alright! What was the 1st thing you did this morning?\n \n00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.050\nSpeaker 1: Got out of bed and took a drank of water.\n \n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.720\nSpeaker 2: alright! What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Subjective (S):**\nPatient M, a 24-year-old male, attended the session accompanied by his caregiver. Patient M reported being shot in the head, which resulted in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in December 2022. Before his injury, he served in the military as MOS 15T, working with Blackhawk helicopters, and later took up masonry and aircraft work at Spirit AeroSystems. The primary goal of the session was to assess Patient M's capability to use assistive technology (Alexa) for daily tasks. Patient M was cooperative and expressed understanding of the session's purpose, with his caregiver prompting and assisting as needed during the conversation.\n\n**Objective (O):**\nA comprehensive functional communication and cognitive-linguistic assessment was conducted, utilizing questions, repetition, sequencing tasks, and categorization exercises. Patient M demonstrated varying abilities in memory recall, comprehension, and cognitive processing:\n- Successfully repeated short sequences of numbers and words but had difficulty with longer sequences.\n- Followed multi-step instructions with some errors in recollection.\n- Showed adequate ability to recall recently given information, such as dates and words.\n- Demonstrated challenges with complex temporal/spatial orientation, evident from errors in labeling months and seasons. \n\nFor the assessment of assistive technology needs and capabilities:\n- Patient M participated in scenarios involving the use of Alexa for scheduling, reminders, and daily task assistance.\n- Rated himself capable of independently executing most Alexa-related commands. \n\n**Assessment (A):**\nPatient M exhibits cognitive communication deficits characteristic of TBI. There's evidence of impaired working memory, recall, and temporal awareness. He shows partial independence and willingness to use assistive technology (Alexa) for day-to-day functioning but will benefit from supervision and additional training. The caregiver's involvement is crucial for reinforcing the learning process, as they serve as an essential support system. While Patient M is capable of independent command execution, scaffolding remains vital, especially for complex commands. Continued interventions with a focus on practice, consistency, and caregiver involvement are recommended.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n1. **Goals:**\n   - Enhance Patient M\u2019s independence in using Alexa for scheduling and reminders.\n   - Improve cognitive-linguistic skills, focusing on memory and temporal orientation.\n\n2. **Training and Device Utilization:**\n   - Provide patient with an Alexa device to enable consistent practice.\n   - Conduct consistent training sessions focused on formulating and executing voice commands.\n\n3. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Task 1: Alarms \n     - Command: \"Alexa, set an alarm for medications at 7:45 AM every day.\"\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set an alarm for 6:30 AM on Mondays.\"\n   - Task 2: Reminders\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set a reminder for neurology appointment.\"\n     - Command: \"Alexa, remind me to play video games.\"\n   - Task 4: Timers\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set a timer for 2 minutes.\"\n\n4. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Arrange regular check-ins to monitor progress and adjust the exercise plan based on performance.\n   - Engage the caregiver in training sessions to ensure they're equipped to support Patient M's learning and practice at home. \n\nPatient M and his caregiver are motivated and engaged, promising a positive prognosis with continued intervention and support. The next session is scheduled to introduce the physical Alexa device to reinforce independence in task execution.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear and concise overview of the patient's background, including the traumatic brain injury and previous occupations. It effectively outlines the session's primary goal and the patient's cooperation and understanding. However, it could benefit from more detailed information on the patient's current symptoms or challenges related to the TBI.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section includes a comprehensive assessment of the patient's cognitive and communication abilities, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses. It effectively describes the tasks performed and the patient's performance. However, it could be improved by including more specific quantitative data or scores from the assessment to provide a clearer picture of the patient's abilities.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment section accurately identifies the patient's cognitive communication deficits and the need for assistive technology. It provides a thoughtful analysis of the patient's capabilities and the importance of caregiver involvement. The section could be enhanced by offering more detailed insights into the specific areas of cognitive-linguistic skills that require improvement.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and outlines clear goals, training, and home exercise programs. It includes specific tasks and commands for the patient to practice with Alexa, demonstrating a practical approach to enhancing independence. The follow-up plan is thorough, emphasizing caregiver involvement and regular progress monitoring. The plan could be further improved by specifying the frequency and duration of training sessions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright.\n \n00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:54.020\nSpeaker 1: This one.\n \n00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:07.109\nSpeaker 2: The order was a little switched, and you missed one as well. So but that's fine.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note: Week 2 (Entertainment Focus)**\n\n**Subjective (S):** \nThe participant, M.A., was present during this virtual session accompanied by his mother, who is his primary caregiver following his traumatic brain injury (TBI) which resulted in blindness and cognitive communication deficits. M.A. expressed happiness and a sense of achievement when he successfully used Alexa to set reminders and appointments. He displayed enthusiasm when discussing his interests in sports, video games, and music. M.A.'s mother provided additional context and assisted him in articulating responses during the session. M.A. expressed excitement about learning new ways to utilize technology for entertainment, especially interested in auditory games and watching sports through described audio means.\n\n**Objective (O):** \nThe session focused on assessing entertainment needs and enhancing M.A.\u2019s ability to independently use Alexa for leisure activities. \n- **Technology Utilized**: TV, Xbox, iPhone, iPad, and Alexa.\n- **Primary Interests**:\n  - Sports: Particularly ice hockey, with his caregiver describing games through tactile feedback.\n  - Video Games: Engages with auditory-based games such as \"Shadow of the Veil.\"\n  - Music: Enjoys artists like Nipsey Hussle and Kendrick Lamar, though faced challenges accessing songs due to subscription limits.\n- **Alexa Commands Practiced**: \n  1.

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note for Patient M.A. - Entertainment and Leisure Activities Assessment**\n\n**Date:** 07/25/2024\n\n**Patient:** M.A.\n\n**Caregiver:** M.A.'s Mother\n\n**Subjective (S):** \nM.A. accompanied by his mother attended a virtual session focused on identifying needs and preferences for entertainment and leisure activities. M.A., who has a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting in blindness, demonstrated interest in participating and was actively engaged in the session. M.A. expressed satisfaction in independently setting reminders and appointments using Alexa. He showed enthusiasm for leisure activities, specifically enjoying sports such as ice hockey, and using technology for entertainment, although he is reliant on auditory descriptions due to his visual impairment. His mother elaborated on his responses and highlighted their teamwork approach for effective communication and engagement in activities.\n\n**Objective (O):** \n- **Current Entertainment Activities:** \n  - Enjoys listening to live sports with real-time descriptions from his mother.\n  - Engages in auditory video games designed for visually impaired users, particularly \"Shadow of the Veil\" on the Xbox.\n  - Expressed interest in streaming music and potentially exploring Netflix once account compatibility is established.\n- **Technology Utilization:**\n  - Uses Alexa for setting reminders and appointments independently.\n  - Engages with Xbox and other digital devices for accessing entertainment.\n  - Familiar with using iPhone and iPad for digital content and utilitarian tasks.\n- **Demonstrated Skills:**\n  - Successfully set a reminder using Alexa without external assistance.\n  - Participated in a range of Alexa commands during the session such as requesting music, jokes, and information.\n\n**Assessment (A):** \nM.A. shows a proactive attitude towards engaging with entertainment technology despite the challenges posed by his visual impairment. He benefits significantly from caregiver support, as evident from his mother\u2019s active involvement during the session. While he articulates and verbalizes commands effectively, occasional auditory confirmation from Alexa is necessary to ascertain the correct execution of tasks. The utilization of auditory-focused games and services suggests a strong adaptation to M.A.'s preferred style of interaction that accommodates his visual limitations. His ability to verbalize novel commands encourages positive reinforcement and confirms comprehension of voice-activated tools.\n\n**Plan (P):** \n- **Skill Development:**\n  - Continue reinforcing M.A.'s ability to use Alexa for independent activity execution, focusing on increasing the complexity of commands over time.\n  - Encourage exploration of additional auditory-based entertainment channels that may enhance leisure time.\n- **Structured Exercise:**\n  - Task: Set multiple reminders using varied timeframes and contexts via Alexa to fortify capability in using day-to-day digital assistance.\n  - Collaborate with mother to establish streaming service access on an Amazon-enabled device to broaden experience with entertainment media.\n- **Caregiver Facilitation:**\n  - Maintain caregiver involvement to ensure a supportive environment and successful deployment of entertainment technology.\n  - Caregiver to explore Amazon skill features that offer game and music enhancements tailored to individuals with similar sensory challenges.\n- **Follow-Up:**\n  - Schedule a subsequent session to assess progress in entertainment engagement and modify exercise as needed to increase participant independence with use of Alexa and similar devices. \n\nThis strategy aims to balance instructional oversight with independent exploration, providing M.A. the autonomy to enjoy and navigate his preferred activities with reliability and ease.\n\nResponse: **SOAP Note Evaluation for Patient M.A.**\n\n**Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's interests and engagement in the session. It effectively captures M.A.'s enthusiasm for leisure activities and his use of technology, as well as the supportive role of his mother. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about M.A.'s specific preferences and any challenges he faces in his daily activities.\n\n**Objective (O):** 9/10  \nThe objective section is well-detailed, outlining M.A.'s current entertainment activities and his proficiency with technology. It provides specific examples of his skills and interests, which are crucial for understanding his capabilities and areas for development. The section could be improved by including more quantitative data or observations from the session.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a thoughtful analysis of M.A.'s engagement with technology and his adaptation to auditory-focused activities. It highlights the importance of caregiver support and M.A.'s ability to use voice-activated tools. However, it could be enhanced by discussing potential barriers to his progress and strategies to overcome them.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and tailored to M.A.'s needs, focusing on skill development, structured exercises, and caregiver facilitation. It outlines clear steps for enhancing M.A.'s independence and engagement with entertainment technology. The plan could be strengthened by specifying measurable goals and timelines for follow-up sessions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay.

So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3.

Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3.

If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note for Patient M.A. - Week 4**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nM.A. participated in the virtual session with his caregiver, focusing on self-care, medical needs, and the use of smart technology (i.e., Alexa).

He expressed a desire to manage tasks such as brushing teeth, trimming nails, and remembering to eat breakfast at consistent times. M.A. currently relies on his iPhone for setting reminders, although caregiver assistance is still significant.\n\n**Objective (O):**\n- The session included demonstrations of how to use Alexa for daily living supports, focusing on setting reminders and accessing information and entertainment autonomously.\n- M.A. and his caregiver engaged in scenarios using Alexa to set reminders for medication schedules, daily tasks, and appointments. M.A. was guided to set reminders for medications and daily tasks using voice commands.\n- Practiced commands included: playing specific media, setting medication reminders, checking off tasks, managing a routine, performing basic self-care tasks, and making inquiries for medications and healthcare professionals.\n- M.A. demonstrated the ability to recall and articulate voice commands with moderate cueing from the caregiver and clinician.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nM.A. shows progress in utilizing voice-assisted technology for managing personal care tasks and reminders, yet requires ongoing support from caregivers. His ability to issue commands to Alexa was successful in structured settings but might be limited by complex instructions or new scenarios without guidance. Caregiver involvement is crucial due to the complexity of some tasks and his health conditions. M.A. is capable of understanding and utilizing Alexa for specific needs and shows potential for increased independence with continued practice and caregiver support. The adaptability of Alexa to complex questions (i.e., multi-step or open-ended) remains an area for potential improvement in M.A.'s interaction skills.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n1. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Continue practicing setting alarms and reminders using Alexa for medication and daily self-care routines.\n   - Develop a structured routine list that M.A. can follow and ask Alexa to review daily.\n   - Engage in practice sessions where commands are phrased in varied forms to ensure adaptability and comprehension by Alexa.\n\n2. **Future Sessions:**\n   - Focus on expanding scenarios where M.A. might use Alexa independently, such as accessing information on books or pharmacies.\n   - Encourage exploration of additional functional voice commands relevant to M.A.'s daily life, including culinary tasks or scheduling appointments.\n   - Further integrate M.A.'s current technology (iPhone, iPad) with Alexa to streamline reminders and daily scheduling.\n\n3. **Caregiver Training:**\n   - Encourage caregivers to gradually reduce reminders, allowing M.A. to rely more on technology, fostering independence.\n   - Teach caregivers strategies to troubleshoot technology-related issues (e.g., tasks not understanding voice commands), including contacting app support for resolving specific integration issues like the Bard app.\n\n4. **Follow-Up and Reporting:**\n   - Schedule a review session in the next week to evaluate progress on using technology and adjust plans accordingly.\n   - Encourage M.A. and his caregiver to document instances where technology enhances independence or suggests areas requiring additional support.\n\nM.A. demonstrates motivation to participate and improve independence in his daily routines using technology. With consistent practice and caregiver support, there is potential for significant improvement in his autonomy in managing daily tasks.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's current situation, including his interest in becoming more independent and his reliance on technology and caregiver support. However, it could benefit from more specific details about the patient's feelings or any challenges he faces with the current setup.\n\n**Objective (O):** 9/10  \nThe objective section is well-detailed, describing the activities and demonstrations conducted during the session. It effectively outlines the patient's interactions with Alexa and the support provided by the caregiver and clinician. It could be improved by including specific examples of the patient's performance or any quantitative measures of success.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a good synthesis of the patient's progress and current capabilities. It highlights the areas where the patient is succeeding and where he needs further support. However, it could be enhanced by including more specific examples of the patient's limitations or challenges with complex tasks.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and outlines clear steps for the patient's continued development, including home exercises, future session goals, and caregiver training. It effectively addresses the patient's needs and provides a structured approach to improving his independence. It could be further improved by specifying measurable goals or timelines for achieving certain milestones.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you.

I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright!

Gabar.\n \n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.670\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Alright alright! What was the 1st thing you did this morning?\n \n00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.050\nSpeaker 1: Got out of bed and took a drank of water.\n \n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.720\nSpeaker 2: alright! What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay. What what year is it?\n \n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.590\nSpeaker 1: 2,024.\n \n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.959\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what season are we in.\n \n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.010\nSpeaker 1: Summer.\n \n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.230\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nPatient M.A. attended a virtual session with his caregivers. M.A. is blind due to a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and experiences cognitive communication deficits. He was cheerful, cooperative, and actively engaged in the session. M.A. expressed that using Alexa (referred to as Speaker 4) has been beneficial in assisting with daily tasks. The caregivers elaborated on M.A.'s responses and assisted in recalling commands and tasks related to his training. M.A. indicated that his main goal with using Alexa is to double-check facts and verify information.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nThe session focused on using Alexa for reminders, scheduling, and retrieving information. \n- **Scenarios with Alexa:**\n  - M.A. successfully executed voice commands to add medication to his list, with minimal assistance, demonstrating progress in using technology for managing daily tasks.\n  - Commands practiced included creating a medicine list, checking the current temperature, inquiring about the traffic, and learning about world events.\n- **M.A.'s Performance:**\n  - He managed to unmute and mute Alexa independently, showing improved familiarity with the device.\n  - He was able to ask Alexa about daily events and questions concerning historical events, such as World War II and the Olympic games, but needed prompts and guidance for more specific inquiries.\n  - M.A. listened daily to news podcasts with his father, indicating an interest in current events.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nM.A. showed considerable improvement in utilizing voice commands to interact with Alexa, notably with simpler tasks like checking weather updates and setting reminders. The involvement and guidance from his caregivers remain essential, providing him cues when needed and expanding his understanding of potential questions he could ask Alexa. The training demonstrated M.A.'s ability to form new questions and adapt to feedback, indicating adaptability and learning progression. The usage of Alexa appears to be a beneficial tool in aiding M.A.'s daily living and enhancing his independence in acquiring information.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- Continue practice with Alexa to enhance independence, particularly focusing on expanding command repertoire and refining question structure.\n- Introduce more complex scenarios requiring M.A. to create reminders and inquire about specific events without caregiver assistance.\n- Implement a home exercise program to further develop skills:\n  - **Tasks and Commands:**\n    - Set an alarm or reminder for medication daily.\n    - Practice creating events on Alexa, such as a gym or therapy appointment.\n    - Regularly ask Alexa for news updates and specific interest topics, such as historical facts.\n- Encourage practice with the newly received Echo device to allow M.A. to become more autonomous in handling day-to-day tasks and information seeking.\n\nThe session ends with a plan to consolidate M.A.'s independence in utilizing Alexa, with ongoing support from caregivers to ensure optimal learning and adaptability in acquiring new skills.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's condition, mood, and goals. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about the patient's history and specific challenges related to the TBI and cognitive communication deficits.\n\n**Objective (O):** 8/10  \nThe objective section effectively outlines the tasks performed during the session and M.A.'s performance. It includes specific examples of commands practiced and M.A.'s interactions with Alexa. However, it could be improved by including more quantitative data or specific observations about M.A.'s cognitive and communication abilities.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a good analysis of M.A.'s progress and the role of caregivers. It highlights the benefits of using Alexa and M.A.'s adaptability. However, it could be enhanced by discussing potential barriers to progress and strategies to overcome them.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and includes specific tasks and goals for M.A. to work on. It outlines a clear strategy for increasing M.A.'s independence and includes a home exercise program. The plan could be improved by specifying how progress will be measured and any follow-up actions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright! Tell me what month it is now.\n \n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.240\nSpeaker 1: July.\n \n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.419\nSpeaker 2: What day of the week is it today.\n \n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.180\nSpeaker 1: Tuesday.\n \n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.340\nSpeaker 2: Who is your doctor?\n \n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.550\nSpeaker 1: I have multiple doctors have health issues.

That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes - Week 5: Participant M.A.**\n\n**Date:** 08-15-2024\n\n**Subjective (S):**\n\nThe session was attended by Participant M.A. and his caregivers. M.A. has been trying to navigate and adapt to using Alexa for everyday tasks following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that caused blindness and cognitive communication deficits. He expressed some frustration with the device not being able to vocalize recipe options, which complicates its use. The caregivers are actively involved and provide support throughout the sessions.\n\n**Objective (O):**\n\n- **Group Therapy/Training:** Focus was on using Alexa for meal preparation and creating shopping lists.\n- Technology used: Echo Show, Echo Dot, and the presenting clinician's device.\n- **Alexa Commands Practiced:**\n  - Finding recipes: M.A. faced challenges getting Alexa to read recipe options aloud, partly resolved by using an Echo Dot without a screen.\n  - Shopping list: Successfully added and checked off items on the list.\n  - Dietary needs: Attempted to find gluten-free and vegan recipes, faced challenges with Alexa not reading the recipes.\n  - Nutritional information: Successfully queried Alexa for nutrition facts like sugar and sodium content in food items.\n- **Technical Difficulties:** Issues were encountered with screen-sharing and with Alexa\u2019s voice recognition in identifying correct commands.\n- Support was provided by caregivers and clinicians to troubleshoot and optimize commands for better functionality.\n\n**Assessment (A):**\n\nParticipant M.A. continues to exhibit a positive attitude despite technological challenges linked to his sensory and cognitive limitations. His caregivers play a crucial role in facilitating his participation and providing necessary scaffolding. M.A. demonstrated perseverance, evident from his improved voice projection and involvement compared to prior sessions. Although there are ongoing difficulties with device settings and command recognition, potential solutions were explored, such as using devices without screens and specifying command phrasing to improve interaction. The session highlighted the need for continued adaptive strategies to aid his independence.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n\n1. **Device Utilization:** Continued exploration of optimizing settings on screened devices or switching to screenless models to ensure better functionality.\n   \n2. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - **Task 1: Recipe Exploration**\n     - Command 1: \"Alexa, find and read me gluten-free Mac and cheese recipes.\"\n     - Practice different phrasing to ensure the device reads options aloud.\n   \n   - **Task 2: Shopping List Management**\n     - Command 1: \"Alexa, add [item] to my shopping list.\"\n     - Command 2: \"Alexa, read my shopping list.\"\n   \n   - **Task 3: Substitution and Nutritional Information**\n     - Command 1: \"Alexa, find a substitution for coconut milk.\"\n     - Command 2: \"Alexa, how many grams of sugar are in a chocolate chip cookie?\"\n   \n3. **Caregiver Involvement:** Ensure caregivers are familiar with device functionality and settings; collaborate to research potential device settings (like VoiceView) or alternative solutions that can better cater to M.A.'s needs.\n\n4. **Next Session Preview:** Conduct an evaluation with M.A. and caregivers to gather feedback and determine the effectiveness of interventions and strategies implemented so far. Focus will be on reviewing M.A.'s progress and planning for post-program activities to ensure continued growth and adaptation skills.\n\nThe focus remains on fostering independence via specialized command practice, and facilitating caregiver support will assure the effectiveness of these practices beyond the therapy sessions.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear understanding of the patient's current situation, including the challenges faced with using Alexa due to TBI-related blindness and cognitive communication deficits. The involvement of caregivers is noted, which adds context to the patient's support system. However, more detailed patient quotes or specific examples of frustration could enhance the depth of this section.\n\n**Objective (O):** 9/10  \nThe objective section is well-detailed, outlining the specific tasks practiced during the session and the technology used. It effectively highlights the challenges and successes experienced by the participant, such as issues with Alexa's voice recognition and the successful management of a shopping list. The inclusion of technical difficulties and the support provided is comprehensive.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a good synthesis of the participant's progress and challenges, emphasizing the positive attitude and the role of caregivers. It identifies ongoing difficulties and potential solutions, which is crucial for understanding the participant's current status. However, it could benefit from more specific examples of how the participant's perseverance has manifested in improved skills or behaviors.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is thorough and well-structured, detailing specific tasks and commands for the participant to practice, which are tailored to his needs. It includes caregiver involvement and previews the next session, ensuring continuity of care. The plan could be enhanced by specifying measurable goals or criteria for evaluating the success of the interventions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay.

That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone.

So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3.

Sounds. \n \n00:42:31.010 --> 0:42:34.940 \nSpeaker 1: I'm a nurse, I where treat myself. \n \n00:42:35.840 --> 0:42:38.970 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Oh, okay, that means a lot. \n \n00:42:38.970 --> 0:42:39.600 \nSpeaker 1: Britain. \n \n00:42:39.880 --> 0:42:40.790 \nSpeaker 2: Right. \n \n00:42:41.180 --> 0:42:56.910 \nSpeaker 1: Finding amount of health. I have a therapist treating an itch, finding a dermatology. I have all of those done. They accept their products. \n \n00:42:57.260 --> 0:42:57.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:42:57.740 --> 0:43:00.009 \nSpeaker 1: I find everything. \n \n00:43:00.220 --> 0:43:16.020 \nSpeaker 2: Find everything. Okay. Alright. So I'm gonna mark all of those as twos. and then we'll move on to meal preparation. So, finding a meal using. Speaker 3. You think. \n \n00:43:16.020 --> 0:43:18.728 \nSpeaker 1: I already know how to cook. \n \n00:43:19.671 --> 0:43:39.580 \nSpeaker 2: Say you were in a different say, maybe you were in a different, you know, place or like, you know, you're traveling or something, and you needed, you know, to find a meal outside. Do you think you would be able to use Speaker 3 independently to find them find a find, a meal. or find a restaurant. \n \n00:43:40.580 --> 0:43:42.149 \nSpeaker 1: I use my phone. \n \n00:43:42.910 --> 0:43:45.080 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. But. \n \n00:43:45.633 --> 0:43:49.510 \nSpeaker 1: Lexa. I won't have it with me. \n \n00:43:50.360 --> 0:44:00.229 \nSpeaker 2: Right? So that's the good part about Speaker 3. You can also have a phone app of Speaker 3 on your phone. So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes #6: M.A. Week 6**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nThe session included M.A., his caregiver (mother), and the virtual assistant, Alexa. M.A. continues to work towards independence in daily activities post-TBI, which resulted in blindness and cognitive communication deficits. His mother expressed satisfaction with progress in using Alexa for creating to-do lists, engaging in auditory games, listening to music, and searching for information. Notably, M.A. has maintained learned commands beyond initial training, leveraging Alexa for tasks like creating shopping lists on his phone for weekly trips to Costco, enhancing his participation beyond merely pushing the cart. The mother emphasized her commitment to using Alexa to assist M.A. in regaining pre-accident skills for greater independence. There were noted challenges with auditory descriptions on Alexa\u2019s screen, highlighting accessibility gaps for visually impaired users unfamiliar with screen reading technology.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \n- **Technology Utilized:** M.A. uses Alexa for creating to-do lists and reminders, facilitating a semblance of independence in daily tasks and interactions.\n- M.A. has successfully maintained learned verbal commands with Alexa beyond the sessions.\n- Shopping list creation and management for trips indicates practical application and retention of skills.\n- **Challenges:** Difficulty in utilizing Alexa\u2019s visual screen options due to lack of auditory support, presenting accessibility issues for visually impaired users.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nM.A. shows positive progress in achieving independence via Alexa, particularly in the retention and application of voice commands beyond structured sessions. His ability to adapt learned skills to real-life contexts, such as shopping list management, underscores his growth. However, the lack of auditory feedback from Alexa's screen options remains a barrier, indicating a need for augmented auditory support in technology used by visually impaired users. M.A.\u2019s motivation and the caregiver's consistent support are crucial factors in his continued improvement.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n1. **Skills Reinforcement:** Continue practicing voice commands with Alexa to enhance fluency and confidence.\n2. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - **To-Do Lists:** \u201cAlexa, add [item] to my shopping list.\u201d\n   - **Reminders:** \u201cAlexa, remind me to [task] at [time].\u201d\n   - **Games & Music:** Engage with Alexa for auditory activities to strengthen communication skills.\n3. **Technological Support Exploration:** Explore additional auditory assistive technologies or skills for Alexa that may bridge existing accessibility gaps for M.A.\n4. **Caregiver Support:** Continued caregiver engagement to reinforce learned skills and introduce new Alexa commands.\n5. **Follow-Up:** Weekly sessions to monitor progress and adapt technology use as needed. \n\nThe ongoing goal remains improving M.A.'s autonomy in daily activities through effective technology use and addressing the accessibility issues with personalized solutions.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a comprehensive overview of M.A.'s current status, including his progress and challenges. It effectively captures the patient's and caregiver's perspectives, highlighting the use of Alexa for daily activities and the caregiver's commitment. However, it could benefit from more specific examples of M.A.'s challenges and successes.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the use of technology and the challenges faced by M.A. It mentions the practical application of skills and the accessibility issues with Alexa's visual options. However, it lacks specific data or observations, such as examples of commands used or the frequency of successful task completion.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a clear analysis of M.A.'s progress and the barriers he faces. It effectively links the subjective and objective findings, emphasizing the need for improved auditory support. The section could be strengthened by including more detailed insights into how these challenges impact M.A.'s daily life.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and addresses key areas for M.A.'s continued improvement. It includes specific actions for skill reinforcement, technological exploration, and caregiver support. The plan is actionable and tailored to M.A.'s needs, though it could include more details on how progress will be measured in follow-up sessions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you.

And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay.

Are you ready. \n \n00:33:12.760 --> 0:33:13.165 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:33:13.570 --> 0:33:42.610 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, here it is. Anna's husband gave her a beautiful ruby ring for her birthday that night she decided to wear the rain, but she couldn't find it. Anna searched everywhere, and then began to cry.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note: R.T. Baseline Assessment 07-08-2024**\n\n**Subjective (S):**\nR.T., a 31-year-old male, attended the virtual session without any accompaniment. He expressed experiencing difficulties primarily with short-term memory, often requiring ideas to marinate before articulation. Despite this impairment, his long-term memory remains intact. R.T. is currently unemployed but actively seeking employment opportunities, particularly in clinical science, maintaining a valid California clinical scientist license. He resides with his parents following an injury and benefits from their supportive presence. R.T. employs strategies such as taking notes on physical and digital calendars to manage his daily tasks and appointments. He has access to technology like Siri on his iPhone for assistance but seldom utilizes it, preferring manual entries. R.T. is determined to improve and maintain his independence by making use of available resources.\n\n**Objective (O):**\n- **Cognitive and Communication Skills Assessment:** R.T. was subjected to various cognitive and memory tasks, demonstrating challenges primarily with short-term memory recall and word retrieval. He employs mnemonic devices successfully for memorization tasks.\n- **ADL and Tech Utilization:** Utilizes physical and digital tools for task management. Minimal usage of voice-activated technology such as Siri for daily tasks, including scheduling.\n- **Scenario Using Alexa:** R.T. observed, was assessed for his ability to perform certain tasks using an Alexa or similar voice-activated device, and reported varying levels of confidence in independently performing tasks like setting up appointments and managing reminders.\n\n**Assessment (A):**\nR.T. presents with short-term memory deficits impacting his task execution and planning capabilities post-injury. His injury requires him to rely on structured routines and strategies for effective daily function. Despite challenges, he employs effective strategies to compensate for memory issues and wishes to integrate technology into his routine more proficiently. Cognitive tasks highlight the need to develop efficient strategies to enhance short-term memory retrieval and word-finding abilities. R.T. exhibits strong motivation and is amenable to therapeutic training and interventions to foster further independence.\n\n**Plan (P):**\nThe plan is to continue therapy focusing on enhancing cognitive function and integrating voice-activated technology to improve daily activity management:\n- **Training:** Introduce R.T. to use Alexa or similar devices more effectively to manage schedules and reminders, following a structured approach.\n- **Home Exercise Program:**\n  - **Task 1: Alarms**\n     - Command 1: \"Alexa, set an alarm for medications at 7:45 am every day.\"\n     - Command 2: \"Alexa, set an alarm for 6:30 am on Mondays.\"\n     - Command 3: \"Alexa, cancel the alarm for 6:30 am on Mondays.\"\n  - **Task 2: Reminders**\n     - Command 1: \"Alexa, set a reminder for a neurology appointment.\"\n     - Command 2: \"Alexa, remind me to play video games.\"\n  - **Task 3: Appointments**\n     - Command 1: \"I want to set up a neurosurgery appointment.\"\n  - **Task 4: Timers**\n     - Command 1: \"Alexa, set a timer for 2 minutes.\"\n- **Follow-up:** Scheduled training sessions to strengthen cognitive skills through repetition and the adoption of technological tools.\n- **Support & Monitoring:** Encourage family involvement to bolster his confidence and provide initial assistance while using new technological aids.\n- **Further Evaluation:** Regular assessment of R.T.'s adaptation to these strategies and devices to ensure efficacy and modify plans as needed.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a comprehensive overview of R.T.'s current situation, including his memory challenges, living situation, and strategies for managing daily tasks. It effectively captures the patient's perspective and context, although it could benefit from more specific examples of how his memory issues impact his daily life.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the cognitive and communication skills assessment and R.T.'s use of technology. It provides a clear picture of his abilities and challenges, but lacks specific data or results from the cognitive tasks, which would strengthen the objective findings.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment accurately identifies R.T.'s short-term memory deficits and his reliance on structured routines. It highlights his motivation and willingness to improve, which is crucial for planning interventions. However, it could be more detailed in discussing the potential causes or contributing factors to his memory issues.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and focuses on practical steps to enhance R.T.'s cognitive function and technology use. It includes specific tasks and commands for using Alexa, which are actionable and relevant. The inclusion of family support and regular follow-up is a strong aspect, ensuring a comprehensive approach to R.T.'s rehabilitation.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you.

We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see.

The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed.

What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay.

She reached into her pocket for her handkerchief, and there was the ring. Okay. now you tell me the same story. Okay? Ready? \n \n00:33:42.610 --> 0:34:03.620 \nSpeaker 1: Anna's husband gave her a a ruby ring she was going to wear that night. and she couldn't find it.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3.

Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note for Patient R.T.**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nR.T. attended the interview session without any caregivers present. She mentioned using a wall calendar and her iPhone's Apple Calendar app to help schedule her reminders and appointments. R.T. feels that having schedules in a dual format (physical calendar and digital app) reinforces her ability to remember appointments and activities. She also uses phone alarms and her Alexa device to notify her of upcoming appointments like physical and speech therapy, as well as social activities and errands.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nUser needs assessment: An interview-style Q&A was conducted to understand R.T.'s needs for scheduling and reminders. \n\n- **Technology used for scheduling and reminders:** R.T. utilizes two primary systems: a wall calendar and her iPhone's Apple Calendar app. She also occasionally relies on Alexa for auditory reminders.\n- **Scenarios using Alexa and phone alarms for scheduling and reminders:** \n  1) Reminders for physical therapy appointments, including preparation time for getting dressed and alerting her parents for transportation.\n  2) Speech therapy sessions scheduled twice a week with preparation prompts.\n  3) Social engagements with friends and family requiring reminders for personal preparation and conversational readiness.\n  4) Financial tasks like visits to the credit union for managing investments which aid her in becoming more independent.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nR.T. demonstrated a proactive approach to using multiple tools for managing her schedule, indicating a strong self-motivation towards independence in scheduling and attending various kinds of appointments. Her solutions show an understanding of her needs for both visual and auditory reminders to accommodate her therapy sessions, social interactions, and financial responsibilities.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \nContinue supporting R.T.'s use of multi-platform scheduling systems (both physical and digital) to ensure she maintains independence in managing her time and appointments. \n\n- **Home exercise program:**  \n  - Task 1: Set reminders using Alexa or iPhone calendar for specific tasks such as physical and speech therapy sessions. \n  - Task 2: Implement additional reminders for social events and personal care routines, such as setting prep reminders for outings or maintaining grooming standards for events.\n  - Task 3: Regular check-ins for financial management appointments via reminders to promote independent financial oversight.\n  - Task 4: Encourage practicing initiating conversations and preparing conversational topics with the aid of reminders to support therapy goals concerning social interaction and initiation.\n\nR.T. and her therapeutic team, including her caregivers, remain committed to using these strategies to enhance her independence and self-management skills.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear insight into R.T.'s use of scheduling tools and her reliance on both physical and digital reminders. It effectively captures her feelings about the dual format reinforcing her memory. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about any challenges or specific preferences R.T. might have regarding these tools.\n\n**Objective (O):** 6/10  \nThe objective section outlines the technology R.T. uses and scenarios where these tools are applied. While it provides a good overview, it lacks specific data or observations from the interview that could further substantiate R.T.'s needs and the effectiveness of her current systems.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment is well-articulated, highlighting R.T.'s proactive approach and motivation towards independence. It effectively synthesizes the subjective and objective information to assess her current status. However, it could include more analysis on potential areas for improvement or challenges she faces.\n\n**Plan (P):** 7/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive, detailing specific tasks and goals for R.T. to maintain and enhance her independence. It includes practical steps and encourages the use of her current tools. However, it could be improved by specifying how progress will be monitored or adjusted over time, and by including any potential barriers to implementing the plan.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright!

Gabar.\n \n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.670\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Alright alright! What was the 1st thing you did this morning?\n \n00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.050\nSpeaker 1: Got out of bed and took a drank of water.\n \n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.720\nSpeaker 2: alright! What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember?

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note - Week 2: Entertainment**\n\n**Subjective (S):**\nPatient R.T. participated in the virtual session focused on entertainment preferences using their Alexa device. R.T. expressed enjoyment in watching movies, particularly in theaters where they can enjoy popcorn and comedies. The patient also uses a laptop and cell phone for entertainment, streaming music on Spotify, and watching videos on YouTube. R.T. is interested in exploring older rock and folk music through the Alexa device, as well as setting up reminders to watch trending movies.\n\n**Objective (O):**\nThe session was conducted to assess R.T.'s entertainment needs and preferences using Alexa. \n- Current entertainment technology used includes a laptop, cell phone with Spotify, and YouTube.\n- Scenarios for Alexa use:\n  1. I want to listen to old folk music.\n  2. I want to watch YouTube clips of the show \"Wipeout.\"\n  3. I want to play Sudoku or audiobooks, specifically \"Chicken Soup for the Soul.\"\n  4. I want to ask about the weather for the weekend.\n\nR.T. demonstrated the ability to set an alarm and a reminder using Alexa, practiced playing videos, and adjusted volume commands with varying success.\n\n**Assessment (A):**\nThe patient is able to identify and express entertainment preferences clearly. R.T. is competent in using Alexa to set alarms and reminders, indicating a basic understanding of Alexa's functionalities for managing entertainment. Challenges were noted with some voice command recognitions, like playing specific videos on YouTube, highlighting the need for potential refinement in command phrasing or device settings. Overall, the patient is motivated and able to engage in self-directed entertainment once the mechanics are well-practiced.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n- R.T. to continue practicing commands for playing music and videos on Alexa, aimed at increasing fluency in verbal tasks and enhancing the entertainment experience.\n- Assign home exercises to practice music and video-related commands with Alexa, such as setting a playlist, adjusting volume, and exploring new artists or videos.\n- Implement support mechanisms for troubleshooting command recognition issues to improve Alexa interactions.\n- Regular follow-up sessions to monitor progress and make adjustments to the assistive technology as necessary. \n\n**Home Exercise Program:**\n- Task 1: Music Commands\n  - \"Alexa, play my Fleetwood Mac playlist.\"\n  - \"Alexa, set volume to level 5.\"\n  - \"Alexa, pause the music.\"\n\n- Task 2: Video Commands\n  - \"Alexa, play funny cat videos on YouTube.\"\n  - \"Alexa, pause the video.\"\n  - \"Alexa, rewind 10 seconds.\"\n\n- Open Task: Explore and list 2 new skills or games available on Alexa that interest you.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear insight into the patient's entertainment preferences and current use of technology. It effectively captures the patient's interest in using Alexa for exploring music and setting reminders. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about any specific difficulties or limitations the patient experiences with current entertainment methods.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the session's focus and the patient's current technology use. It lists specific scenarios for Alexa use, which is helpful. However, it lacks detailed observations or measurements of the patient's performance during the session, such as the success rate of command execution or specific challenges faced.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a good synthesis of the patient's abilities and challenges with using Alexa for entertainment. It identifies areas for improvement and acknowledges the patient's motivation. However, it could be more specific about the nature of the challenges with voice command recognition and any patterns observed.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and includes specific tasks for the patient to practice, which are well-aligned with the assessment findings. It also includes follow-up and support mechanisms, which are crucial for ongoing progress. The inclusion of a home exercise program is a strong point, though it could be enhanced by specifying the frequency and duration of practice sessions.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note for Patient R.T. - Week 3, August 1, 2024**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nR.T. attended the virtual session and reported feeling well, describing a positive experience visiting the community pool with her father, which she finds beneficial for her recovery. R.T. shared difficulties in self-care routines, namely managing her hair with weaker left arm recovery, applying lotion evenly, and adjusting to a healthier diet to reduce processed foods. She also relies on her smartphone for managing a grocery shopping list, indicating a methodical scientific approach to tasks and organization. She mentioned needing reminders for taking medications due to her neurologist planning to adjust her medication in a few weeks. R.T. expressed her goal to better manage appointments and self-care routines with the assistance of her smart speaker device, Alexa.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nUser needs assessment was conducted focusing on self-care and medication management using technological support.  \n- Technologies used: iPhone for grocery lists, smart speaker (Alexa) for reminders and playing music.  \n- Demonstrated the ability to command Alexa to play music, adjust volume, and manage video playback.  \n- Practiced scenarios involving setting reminders for medications, managing playlists, and other self-care tasks:  \n  1.

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you.

That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good.

Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**\n\nThe patient, R.T., participated in a virtual session where the focus was on using a virtual assistant, referred to as Speaker 3 (Alexa), for setting up reminders and accessing information.

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay.

If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date?

Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay.

You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright.

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes #2**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nThe patient, J.S., attended the in-person session accompanied by her husband.

J.S. identified stress and lack of sleep as potential triggers. She expressed frustration over the impact of migraines on her daily activities and quality of life. J.S. has been using over-the-counter pain relievers, which provide partial relief. Her husband noted concerns about the frequency of medication use and its effectiveness. \n\n**Objective (O):**  \n- Patient exhibits signs of discomfort as indicated by frequent wincing and shielding from overhead lighting during the session.\n- Blood pressure: 128/82 mmHg.\n- Heart rate: 78 bpm.\n- Recent MRI and blood work (conducted two weeks ago) show no significant abnormalities that would explain an increase in migraine frequency.\n- Medication review: Currently taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for pain management.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \n- Migraines with aura, worsening in frequency.\n- Over-the-counter medication providing insufficient pain control.\n- Stress and sleep disturbances noted as potential exacerbating factors.\n- Patient presents concern for rebound headaches due to frequent use of painkillers.\n- Continuation of current symptoms might lead to decreased productivity and quality of life impairment.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- Recommend initiation of preventative migraine medication such as a beta-blocker or an anti-seizure medication, after consultation with J.S.\u2019s neurologist.\n- Discuss potential lifestyle modifications with a focus on stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness or yoga, and establish a sleep routine to improve restorative sleep.\n- Gradual reduction of over-the-counter medication to assess the role of potential rebound headaches.\n- Schedule follow-up appointment in four weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the new management plan and make necessary adjustments.\n- Provide education and resources about managing migraine triggers and the importance of medication adherence.\n- Ensure coordination with neurologist to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 9/10  \nThe subjective section is well-detailed, providing a comprehensive overview of the patient's condition, including the history of migraines, current symptoms, potential triggers, and the impact on daily life. The inclusion of the patient's and her husband's perspectives adds depth to the understanding of the situation. However, it could be improved by specifying the exact frequency of migraines and the dosage of over-the-counter medications used.\n\n**Objective (O):** 8/10  \nThe objective section includes relevant physical observations and vital signs, as well as recent diagnostic test results. The medication review is also noted. However, it could be enhanced by including more detailed findings from the physical examination, if applicable, and specifying the exact dosages of the medications being taken.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 9/10  \nThe assessment effectively synthesizes the subjective and objective information to identify the primary issues, including the worsening of migraines, potential medication overuse, and lifestyle factors. It clearly outlines the concerns and potential consequences if the current situation persists. The assessment could be slightly improved by listing any differential diagnoses considered.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and addresses both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, including medication adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up care. It emphasizes coordination with the neurologist and patient education, which are crucial for effective management. The plan could be slightly improved by specifying which preventative medications are being considered and providing more detail on the follow-up process.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you.

I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed.

What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay. What what year is it?\n \n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.590\nSpeaker 1: 2,024.\n \n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.959\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what season are we in.\n \n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.010\nSpeaker 1: Summer.\n \n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.230\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Listen carefully, and I want you to repeat the whole story back to me exactly as I tell it to you. Okay. I can only read it one time. Are you ready. \n \n00:33:12.760 --> 0:33:13.165 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:33:13.570 --> 0:33:42.610 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, here it is. Anna's husband gave her a beautiful ruby ring for her birthday that night she decided to wear the rain, but she couldn't find it. Anna searched everywhere, and then began to cry.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good.

Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Notes #1: R.T. Week 6 Debrief**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nThe participant, R.T., reports using Alexa for setting alarms and completing multimodal interaction tasks. She finds the Alexa device beneficial compared to her cell phone due to its louder alarm sound, aiding her in being reminded while engaged in other tasks like working on her computer. Despite the louder sound being helpful, R.T. experiences challenges with Alexa's speech recognition, especially when setting reminders. She indicates that her pronunciation sometimes leads to misinterpretation, such as confusion between times like 10:30 and 10:40. R.T. finds using Alexa's tactile interface a preferable alternative, allowing her to manually set the time and execute tasks easily. R.T. suggests design improvements for the device, advocating for larger, easy-to-touch widgets to aid users like herself who rely on tactile interaction.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \n- R.T. effectively uses Alexa for task reminders and alarms, finding the device's louder sound advantageous.\n- Difficulty with speech recognition for precise time settings was reported, whereby R.T. prefers using the touch interface.\n- R.T. demonstrated awareness and capability in adapting to alternate methods to achieve desired results via Alexa when encountering voice recognition issues.\n- User feedback includes design recommendations for better accessibility, such as enlarging tactile widgets on the device.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nR.T. successfully utilizes Alexa for daily reminders and alarms, demonstrating adaptability by switching to manual inputs when voice recognition fails. Her insight into potential product modifications highlights a user-centered perspective aimed at increasing accessibility for tactile users. R.T.'s feedback suggests a need for improved speech recognition accuracy and the consideration of enhanced tactile features in smart devices to better accommodate users with similar preferences or needs.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- Continue monitoring R.T.'s interaction with Alexa, focusing on improvements in voice command accuracy and manual interface usage.\n- Encourage R.T. to provide ongoing feedback on device usability as she adapts to using Alexa for everyday tasks.\n- Consider R.T.'s design suggestions as part of user research for future accessibility feature developments.\n- Schedule iterative follow-ups to reassess capabilities and satisfaction with the device, ensuring R.T.'s needs are consistently met.\n\n- **Home Exercise Program:**\n  - Practice voice commands with clear articulation when setting alarms and reminders to improve interaction efficiency.\n  - Explore the Alexa app settings for customization options that may enhance the user interface for tactile use, such as adjusting screen sensitivity or widget sizing, if available.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear and detailed account of R.T.'s experiences and challenges with using Alexa. It effectively captures her personal views and suggestions for improvement. However, it could benefit from a more structured format, such as using bullet points for clarity.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section accurately describes R.T.'s use of Alexa and her adaptability. It includes relevant observations but could be more detailed in terms of specific examples or data to support the observations.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment is well-articulated, summarizing R.T.'s adaptability and providing insights into her user experience. It effectively identifies areas for improvement in the device's design and functionality. However, it could be more concise.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and includes specific actions to address R.T.'s needs and suggestions.

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you?

Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Subjective (S):**  \nM.A. attended a virtual session with his mother, who is one of his primary caregivers following his traumatic brain injury (TBI) that resulted in blindness and cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was engaging and cooperative during the user needs assessment interview, demonstrating a willingness to participate in training tasks despite his impairments. His mother provided additional insights into his responses, aiding in clarification and elaboration on M.A.'s daily challenges and needs, particularly around the use of technology for scheduling and reminders.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nA user needs assessment was conducted through an interview-style Q&A, focusing on M.A.'s needs related to scheduling and reminders. The technology currently utilized includes Siri on M.A.'s iWatch and iPhone, with his mother assisting in setting up appointments and reminders. M.A. requires reminders for regular therapy sessions at BRAIN and Loma Linda, as well as medical and dental appointments. Key scenarios for using Alexa were addressed:\n\n1. Alarms for medication (7:45 am & 7:45 pm daily)\n2. Reminders for personal events (e.g., mother's and father's birthdays)\n3. Reminders for important appointments (e.g., neurology and neurosurgery)\n4. Regular weekly tasks (e.g., VAT training on Thursdays)\n5. Use of timers for daily tasks\n\nDuring group training, M.A. practiced three voice commands related to scheduling and reminders, with partial success requiring verbal modeling from the clinician. He struggled with command completion, needing verbal prompts to adjust vocal volume and missing specific details like time and day, which Alexa needed to prompt.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nM.A.'s ability to contribute to the needs assessment was progressively strengthened by his mother\u2019s input and guidance. Maximal verbal cues and scaffolding were crucial to facilitate his participation given his visual and cognitive impairments. During training, verbal modeling proved essential for M.A., who succeeded in modulating commands with varied sentence structure, indicating creativity in generating functional utterances for Alexa despite needing support. M.A. remains dependent on caregiver assistance due to his visual deficits and TBI. During the session, M.A. did not have his Echo Show, relying instead on the Alexa app on his iPad and occasionally the clinician's device for command execution.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \nM.A. is expected to receive his Echo Show device, which should enhance his independence in interacting with Alexa. Both M.A. and his mother express a strong motivation to continue with the training program. \n\n**Home Exercise Program:**\n\n- **Task 1: Alarms**\n  - \"Alexa, set an alarm for medications at 7:45 am every day.\"\n  - \"Alexa, set an alarm for 6:30 am on Mondays.\"\n  - \"Alexa, cancel the alarm for 6:30 am on Mondays.\"\n\n- **Task 2: Reminders**\n  - \"Alexa, set a reminder for a neurology appointment,\" with Alexa prompting for date and time.\n  - \"Alexa, remind me to play video games,\" with Alexa prompting for date and time.\n  - \"Alexa, cancel the reminder for video games.\"\n  - \"Alexa, I want to set a reminder for mom\u2019s birthday on August 25.\"\n\n- **Open Task:**\n  - Set two reminders for tasks of choice.\n\n- **Task 3: Appointments**\n  - \"I want to set up a neurosurgery appointment,\" with Alexa prompting for specifics.\n\n- **Task 4: Timers**\n  - \"Alexa, set a timer for 2 minutes.\" \n\nThese exercises are intended to reinforce M.A.'s skills and confidence in using voice commands with Alexa to manage personal scheduling and reminders.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of M.A.'s condition, his engagement level, and the role of his mother in the session. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about M.A.'s specific feelings or experiences during the session, as well as any direct quotes or specific concerns he might have expressed.\n\n**Objective (O):** 8/10  \nThe objective section is well-structured, detailing the specific tasks and technologies used during the session. It effectively outlines the scenarios addressed and M.A.'s performance. However, it could include more specific data or observations, such as exact success rates or specific challenges faced during the tasks.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment provides a good synthesis of M.A.'s abilities and challenges, highlighting the importance of caregiver support and verbal modeling. It effectively discusses M.A.'s progress and areas needing improvement. However, it could be enhanced by including more specific examples of M.A.'s creative command generation or specific instances of his dependence on caregiver assistance.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is comprehensive and well-organized, detailing specific tasks for M.A. to practice with Alexa. It clearly outlines the expected outcomes and the rationale behind each exercise. The inclusion of a home exercise program is a strong point, but it could be improved by specifying how progress will be measured or any follow-up actions planned.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8. You're increasing the amount.\n \n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.889\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Say these after me. 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8.\n \n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.980\nSpeaker 1: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 8, hey.\n \n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.259\nSpeaker 2: Say these after me? 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpeaker 1: 8, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7.\n \n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.930\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright.\n \n00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:54.020\nSpeaker 1: This one.\n \n00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:07.109\nSpeaker 2: The order was a little switched, and you missed one as well. So but that's fine. That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**\n\nPatient F.W. attended the session with the aid of his Alexa device. He expressed a need for assistance with scheduling and reminders due to cognitive difficulties following a recent health issue. The patient is cooperative and expressed eagerness to improve his independence using technology. F.W. shared that reminders for daily medications and upcoming appointments are crucial. Additionally, he hesitates occasionally in issuing commands clearly and expressed concern about missing important personal dates and medication times.\n\n**Objective (O):**\n\nDuring the session, the clinician conducted a user needs assessment focusing on F.W.'s requirements for scheduling and reminders. F.W. uses Alexa for setting alarms, reminders, and as an overall assistive device. The assessment revealed:\n\n- **Technology Utilized:** Alexa for daily scheduling tasks and reminders.\n- **Dependency:** F.W. is currently dependent on Alexa to manage daily tasks due to memory lapses.\n- **Scenarios Practiced:**\n  1. Setting an alarm for daily medication intake.\n  2. Establishing reminders for personal events such as birthdays.\n  3. Scheduling future medical appointments.\n- **Alexa Command Practice:** F.W. practiced commands like setting a timer and reminders. He needed verbal cues to enhance volume for successful task execution.\n\n**Assessment (A):**\n\nF.W. actively participated in the assessment, demonstrating some challenges in consistently articulating voice commands due to low volume. He was generally successful in completing tasks after receiving verbal prompts and tried to use different phrasing spontaneously to fulfill tasks, indicating adaptability in command execution. His reliance on external support via Alexa is critical given his cognitive problems, emphasizing the importance of technology in his daily life.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n\n1. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - **Task 1: Alarms**\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set an alarm for medications at 7:45 AM every day.\"\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set an alarm for 6:30 AM on Mondays.\"\n     - Alternate Command: \"Alexa, cancel the alarm for 6:30 AM on Mondays.\"\n  \n   - **Task 2: Reminders**\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set a reminder for a neurology appointment.\"\n     - Command: \"Alexa, remind me to play video games.\"\n     - Command: \"Alexa, I want to set a reminder for mom\u2019s birthday on August 25.\"\n\n   - **Task 3: Appointments**\n     - Command: \"I want to set up a neurosurgery appointment.\"\n \n   - **Task 4: Timers**\n     - Command: \"Alexa, set a timer for 2 minutes.\"\n\n2. **Follow-up:**\n   - Continue practicing voice commands to improve clarity and autonomy.\n   - Monitor the effectiveness of Alexa in supporting daily tasks and adjust training strategies as needed.\n   - Evaluate potential need for caregiver intervention should technological dependency negatively impact daily living or if technical difficulties arise.\n\nF.W. is motivated to achieve greater independence using technology, and his continued practice and adaptation of these skills are recommended to reinforce progress.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear insight into the patient's current situation, including his reliance on technology due to cognitive difficulties. It effectively captures the patient's concerns and goals, such as the need for reminders and scheduling assistance. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about the recent health issue and its impact on his daily life.\n\n**Objective (O):** 9/10  \nThe objective section is well-structured, detailing the specific technologies and scenarios practiced during the session. It provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's current capabilities and dependencies, highlighting the use of Alexa for managing daily tasks. The inclusion of specific scenarios and command practices adds depth to the assessment.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment accurately reflects the patient's challenges and adaptability in using voice commands. It acknowledges the critical role of technology in his daily life and his ability to adapt commands. However, it could be enhanced by discussing the potential impact of these challenges on his overall quality of life and any observed improvements during the session.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is detailed and actionable, outlining specific tasks and commands for the patient to practice. It emphasizes the importance of continued practice and monitoring the effectiveness of Alexa in supporting daily tasks. The inclusion of follow-up strategies and potential caregiver intervention demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the patient's needs. However, it could include more specific goals or timelines for achieving greater independence.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Setting a timer. \n \n00:40:41.020 --> 0:40:42.779 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:40:42.960 --> 0:40:51.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? Alright. Okay. Finding a covid vaccine using Speaker 3. \n \n00:40:54.510 --> 0:41:07.890 \nSpeaker 1: What would I say to Speaker 3 find a covid vaccine at the local wildgrains? \n \n00:41:08.790 --> 0:41:14.450 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you think you you would be able to do that independently or. \n \n00:41:14.680 --> 0:41:15.265 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:41:15.850 --> 0:41:18.320 \nSpeaker 2: I've got finding a Covid test. \n \n00:41:18.320 --> 0:41:35.670 \nSpeaker 1: Alright! I have to instruct Speaker 3 to find one. I have to instruct Speaker 3. Yes, I can do all of these. \n \n00:41:35.670 --> 0:41:37.600 \nSpeaker 2: You can do all of those you think. \n \n00:41:38.390 --> 0:41:41.273 \nSpeaker 1: Getting a stand out. Yeah. \n \n00:41:43.690 --> 0:41:44.305 \nSpeaker 2: it does it. \n \n00:41:44.510 --> 0:41:47.490 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3 know how to get a stay. Now. \n \n00:41:48.090 --> 0:41:55.719 \nSpeaker 2: So it would give you sort of tips and tricks to remove. Remove a stain out of a fabric. \n \n00:41:56.580 --> 0:42:07.260 \nSpeaker 1: I already know that I'm doing everything on there already. \n \n00:42:07.260 --> 0:42:09.959 \nSpeaker 2: Without without any help from anyone. \n \n00:42:10.300 --> 0:42:11.110 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:42:11.340 --> 0:42:23.090 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, everything like treating migraine. If you had one, all of that, you think would be a 2 right. If you if you needed any help you would be able to ask Speaker 3 on your own. \n \n00:42:23.490 --> 0:42:24.210 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:42:24.480 --> 0:42:31.010 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. So do you think all of these are 2? Then finding like, Okay, alright, okay. Sounds. \n \n00:42:31.010 --> 0:42:34.940 \nSpeaker 1: I'm a nurse, I where treat myself. \n \n00:42:35.840 --> 0:42:38.970 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Oh, okay, that means a lot. \n \n00:42:38.970 --> 0:42:39.600 \nSpeaker 1: Britain. \n \n00:42:39.880 --> 0:42:40.790 \nSpeaker 2: Right. \n \n00:42:41.180 --> 0:42:56.910 \nSpeaker 1: Finding amount of health. I have a therapist treating an itch, finding a dermatology. I have all of those done. They accept their products. \n \n00:42:57.260 --> 0:42:57.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:42:57.740 --> 0:43:00.009 \nSpeaker 1: I find everything. \n \n00:43:00.220 --> 0:43:16.020 \nSpeaker 2: Find everything. Okay. Alright. So I'm gonna mark all of those as twos. and then we'll move on to meal preparation. So, finding a meal using. Speaker 3. You think. \n \n00:43:16.020 --> 0:43:18.728 \nSpeaker 1: I already know how to cook. \n \n00:43:19.671 --> 0:43:39.580 \nSpeaker 2: Say you were in a different say, maybe you were in a different, you know, place or like, you know, you're traveling or something, and you needed, you know, to find a meal outside. Do you think you would be able to use Speaker 3 independently to find them find a find, a meal. or find a restaurant. \n \n00:43:40.580 --> 0:43:42.149 \nSpeaker 1: I use my phone. \n \n00:43:42.910 --> 0:43:45.080 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. But. \n \n00:43:45.633 --> 0:43:49.510 \nSpeaker 1: Lexa. I won't have it with me. \n \n00:43:50.360 --> 0:44:00.229 \nSpeaker 2: Right? So that's the good part about Speaker 3. You can also have a phone app of Speaker 3 on your phone. So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**  \nThe participant, F.W., attended the session alone and engaged in a discussion regarding the use of technology for scheduling and reminders. F.W. currently uses an iPhone and iPad for calendar and reminder functions but is unfamiliar with using Alexa for such tasks. F.W. mentioned the routine of taking an allergy medication at night without the need for reminders, expressing confidence in managing calendar events independently. F.W. organizes various appointments such as doctor visits, haircuts, poker games, golf activities, and social events through these devices. He expressed openness to learning how to incorporate Alexa into his scheduling tasks to improve functionality. F.W. noted interest in using Alexa for tasks like recipe guidance and music, indicating a motivation to integrate more technology into daily routines. The participant also reflects possible cognitive impairments, evident by occasional forgetfulness in conversations.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nThe session involved documenting F.W.'s current use of technology for managing schedules and how it aligns with the potential use of Alexa for similar tasks. F.W. effectively uses his Apple devices for setting reminders for 30 minutes before appointments and differentiates events on a shared calendar with his wife. While unfamiliar with Alexa, F.W. showed interest in potentially using it for cooking timers, audio tasks, and other household reminders such as managing sprinklers and laundry. \n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nF.W. shows effective use of existing technology (iPhone and iPad) to manage his scheduling needs, demonstrating independence in handling various personal and social appointments. However, there is a learning curve present in transitioning to or incorporating new technology like Alexa. F.W. identified specific scenarios where timers and reminders could enhance his routine, though current technology use is adequate for most of his needs. Cognitive strategies learned from established routines (e.g., medication adherence) can assist in the future incorporation of Alexa. F.W. is motivated and anticipates finding value in Alexa's abilities, particularly for music and recipes.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n1. **Education & Training:** \n   - Schedule training sessions focusing on setting up and using Alexa for reminders and timers, emphasizing scenarios of F.W.'s interest such as recipes and music.\n   - Provide a step-by-step guide to synchronize Apple devices with Alexa to streamline the transition.\n\n2. **Home Practice Tasks:**\n   - Encourage F.W. to verbally practice setting reminders and timers with Alexa (e.g., \"Alexa, set a timer for the sprinkler for 20 minutes\").\n   - Experiment with setting reminders for daily routines (e.g., home activities and leisure schedules).\n   - Explore using Alexa for new tasks such as managing recipes and playlists.\n\n3. **Follow-up:**\n   - Review F.W.\u2019s progress with Alexa in one month to address any challenges and provide advanced usage tips.\n   - Assess F.W.'s need for additional support in cognitive strategies to enhance memory and management of appointments.  \n\nF.W. is encouraged to maintain his routine of self-sufficiency while exploring new technological aids, leveraging his existing knowledge of digital tools to embrace Alexa\u2019s potential fully.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a comprehensive overview of F.W.'s current use of technology and his openness to incorporating Alexa into his routine. It captures his confidence in managing calendar events and his interest in using Alexa for additional tasks. However, it could benefit from more detailed information on the specific cognitive impairments mentioned, such as examples of forgetfulness.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section effectively documents F.W.'s current technology use and his interest in using Alexa for various tasks. It highlights his effective use of Apple devices and his unfamiliarity with Alexa. However, it lacks specific observations or measurements that could provide a clearer picture of F.W.'s current capabilities and areas for improvement.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment accurately identifies F.W.'s effective use of current technology and the potential benefits of incorporating Alexa. It acknowledges the learning curve and suggests cognitive strategies to aid in the transition. The assessment could be strengthened by providing more detailed analysis of F.W.'s cognitive impairments and how they might impact his use of new technology.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and provides clear steps for education, home practice, and follow-up. It aligns with F.W.'s interests and current capabilities, offering a practical approach to integrating Alexa into his routine. The plan could be enhanced by including specific metrics or goals to measure F.W.'s progress and success in using Alexa.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay.

They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good.

Now. \n \n00:41:48.090 --> 0:41:55.719 \nSpeaker 2: So it would give you sort of tips and tricks to remove. Remove a stain out of a fabric. \n \n00:41:56.580 --> 0:42:07.260 \nSpeaker 1: I already know that I'm doing everything on there already. \n \n00:42:07.260 --> 0:42:09.959 \nSpeaker 2: Without without any help from anyone. \n \n00:42:10.300 --> 0:42:11.110 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:42:11.340 --> 0:42:23.090 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, everything like treating migraine. If you had one, all of that, you think would be a 2 right. If you if you needed any help you would be able to ask Speaker 3 on your own. \n \n00:42:23.490 --> 0:42:24.210 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:42:24.480 --> 0:42:31.010 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. So do you think all of these are 2? Then finding like, Okay, alright, okay.

They accept their products. \n \n00:42:57.260 --> 0:42:57.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:42:57.740 --> 0:43:00.009 \nSpeaker 1: I find everything. \n \n00:43:00.220 --> 0:43:16.020 \nSpeaker 2: Find everything. Okay. Alright. So I'm gonna mark all of those as twos. and then we'll move on to meal preparation. So, finding a meal using. Speaker 3. You think. \n \n00:43:16.020 --> 0:43:18.728 \nSpeaker 1: I already know how to cook. \n \n00:43:19.671 --> 0:43:39.580 \nSpeaker 2: Say you were in a different say, maybe you were in a different, you know, place or like, you know, you're traveling or something, and you needed, you know, to find a meal outside. Do you think you would be able to use Speaker 3 independently to find them find a find, a meal. or find a restaurant. \n \n00:43:40.580 --> 0:43:42.149 \nSpeaker 1: I use my phone. \n \n00:43:42.910 --> 0:43:45.080 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. But. \n \n00:43:45.633 --> 0:43:49.510 \nSpeaker 1: Lexa. I won't have it with me. \n \n00:43:50.360 --> 0:44:00.229 \nSpeaker 2: Right? So that's the good part about Speaker 3. You can also have a phone app of Speaker 3 on your phone. So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**  \nF.W. participated in a virtual therapy session to practice using voice commands with an AI assistant, mainly focused on using Speaker 4 (an AI device). The purpose was to improve his confidence and ability to interact with the AI for playing videos, adjusting volume, and playing songs. F.W. expressed a willingness to engage in exercises but reported not feeling very confident in his abilities initially. However, he acknowledged making progress throughout the session. F.W. does not have a specific preference for the type of media to practice with, allowing the clinician to choose.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nThe session involved practicing specific voice commands with F.W.\u2019s AI device, referred to as Speaker 4. Commands included playing a video trailer, adjusting the volume, pausing, resuming video playback, and interacting with various commands to adjust settings such as the speaking rate of the AI. F.W. was able to successfully execute commands such as \"play trailer for Despicable Me 4,\" \"pause the video,\" \"resume the video,\" and adjust volume and speaking rate. The session also explored playback of songs such as \"Hey Jude\" and \"Sweet Caroline,\" though it was noted that the setup defaults to Amazon Music, requiring further adjustment outside of the therapy session. F.W. required occasional prompting to modify commands for successful execution.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nF.W. demonstrates a basic competency in using AI device voice commands with guidance and modeling. Initial attempts sometimes required repetition or modification based on real-time feedback from the AI device. F.W.'s ability to adapt his command structure upon clinician suggestions, such as using \"resume\" instead of \"play the video,\" indicates growing familiarity and adaptability. The adjustment of the AI\u2019s speaking rate was successful, which may support F.W. in managing information processing during interactions with the AI. However, identifying specific songs using the AI was hindered by dependencies on pre-installed music services (Amazon Music) which require further integration with services F.W. or his family use regularly. F.W. is gradually increasing his confidence in using the device, expressing satisfaction with task completion by the end of the session.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n1. **Continue Practice:** Schedule additional sessions focusing on increasing F.W.'s proficiency and confidence with a broader range of commands. Emphasize practice without external assistance to encourage independence.\n   \n2. **Music Service Integration:** Assist F.W. in setting up compatible music services on Speaker 4 to streamline the process of song playback. \n   \n3. **Expansion of Scenarios:** Introduce more complex scenarios, like creating playlists and setting reminders for daily tasks, to expand capabilities using the AI device.\n\n4. **Home Exercise Program:**\n   - Continue to rehearse voice commands with varying vocabulary for media control, e.g., \"Speak slower,\" \"Fast forward 10 seconds.\"\n   - Practice using commands to explore other applications, like calendars or reminders, to facilitate broader use.\n   - Task F.W. to explore commands in different scenarios, such as scheduling an appointment or setting reminders as part of daily routines.\n\nMonitor progress and adjust the level of complexity and support accordingly to promote F.W.'s independence and confidence with AI technology.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 7/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear overview of the patient's initial feelings and progress during the session. It captures F.W.'s willingness to engage and his initial lack of confidence, which is important for understanding his starting point. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about F.W.'s background or previous experiences with AI technology to provide better context.\n\n**Objective (O):** 8/10  \nThe objective section effectively outlines the specific tasks and commands practiced during the session. It details F.W.'s ability to execute commands and the need for occasional prompting, which is useful for tracking progress. The mention of the default music service issue is relevant, but the section could be improved by including more quantitative data, such as the number of successful attempts versus those requiring modification.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 7/10  \nThe assessment provides a good analysis of F.W.'s current abilities and areas for improvement. It highlights his adaptability and growing confidence, which are key points. However, it could be enhanced by including more specific examples of how F.W. adapted his commands and any particular challenges he faced, to give a more comprehensive picture of his progress.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and provides a clear roadmap for F.W.'s continued development. It includes specific actions, such as integrating music services and expanding command scenarios, which are practical and relevant. The inclusion of a home exercise program is a strong point, as it encourages ongoing practice. The plan could be slightly improved by specifying a timeline for these activities to ensure consistent progress tracking.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright!

Gabar.\n \n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.670\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Alright alright! What was the 1st thing you did this morning?\n \n00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.050\nSpeaker 1: Got out of bed and took a drank of water.\n \n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.720\nSpeaker 2: alright! What will you do when you're done with this session.\n \n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690\nSpeaker 1: I will read my novel.\n \n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.940\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you hear me?  Okay, tell me the 3 words that I told you to remember.\n \n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:39.509\nSpeaker 1: Wow! Blue was the second one. I used to do very well in this, but I don't know. The other 2.\n \n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.060\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. They were slotted.\n \n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nSpeaker 1: Doug.\n \n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.330\nSpeaker 2: Blue and bed. Remember? Okay, yeah.\n \n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.650\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:08:49.202 --> 00:09:04.040\nSpeaker 2: Do you think that it's harder to remember or it's hard your communication is better in the mornings when you are more fresh versus? Okay.\n \n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.989\nSpeaker 1: I I speak better.\n \n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.039\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sometimes the brain tires out as the day goes.\n \n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.720\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:30.800\nSpeaker 2: And it could affect. So that's why. Alright. Okay. Alright. Let's move on. So I'm going to now ask you some questions the these are to do with the concept of time, and I'm sure you're gonna do pretty good with these. Alright. What year is it?\n \n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.170\nSpeaker 1: What was the question? I was talking.\n \n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.200\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Oh, okay. What what year is it?\n \n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.590\nSpeaker 1: 2,024.\n \n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.959\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what season are we in.\n \n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.010\nSpeaker 1: Summer.\n \n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.230\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What? Okay that you told me already. What is our next month?\n \n00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.990\nSpeaker 1: August.\n \n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.520\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. What was our last month?\n \n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.910\nSpeaker 1: June.\n \n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.660\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Hold on! What date is it.\n \n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.600\nSpeaker 1: 16th\n \n00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:21.779\nSpeaker 2: Can hooked. About what time is it right now?\n \n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:21.779\nSpeaker 1: 7:15 central time.\n \n00:10:31.775 --> 00:10:34.200\nSpeaker 2: What was our last holiday.\n \n00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.369\nSpeaker 1: July, 4.th\n \n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:49.709\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. honey. what is your age, Speaker 1?\n \n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.580\nSpeaker 1: 81.\n \n00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:57.189\nSpeaker 2: What are the days of the week?\n \n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:06.859\nSpeaker 1: 7.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):** \nThe participant, F.W., attended the virtual session independently. F.W. addressed frustrations with their new Alexa device, as it is unfamiliar and challenging to navigate compared to their previous technology experiences. F.W. expressed enthusiasm for golf, basketball, card games, and watching St. Louis Cardinals baseball games. They also utilize technology like movies, computers, iPads, iPhones, and various applications, notably Yahoo Finance, for entertainment and personal management. F.W. is adapting to using Alexa for setting reminders which is a new task they are willing to learn.\n\n**Objective (O):** \nA user needs assessment was conducted focusing on F.W.'s interaction with Alexa for scheduling and setting reminders. \n- **Technology Usage:**\n  - Currently uses iPhone and iPad independently for most activities.\n  - Struggles with the new Alexa interface.\n  - Uses Siri for short commands and reminders, such as timing activities like cooking or watering plants.\n  \n- **Task Completion:**\n  - Initial difficulties observed in setting a reminder with Alexa; however, F.W. successfully set an appointment reminder independently after a guidance session.\n  - Engaged in training to manage reminders with Alexa; starting to comprehend the similarity in utilizing short commands similar to Siri.\n\n**Assessment (A):** \nF.W. is generally adept with technology, as evidenced by their independent use of phone applications and Siri for reminders. The participant is in the adjustment phase with Alexa, requiring practice to transition their command usage. There is a noted willingness to learn and engage with the training sessions to improve proficiency. Given F.W.'s independence with other technologies, it's expected that mastery of Alexa will follow with continued practice. No caregiver assistance is mentioned or required for other technological interactions, indicating a high adaptability potential.\n\n**Plan (P):** \nContinue regular training to improve familiarity with Alexa while leveraging F.W.'s existing knowledge of command structures from Siri use:\n- **Home Exercise Program:**\n  1. **Reminder Commands Training:**\n     - Practice setting various reminders using short, concise commands with Alexa.\n     - Focus on timing reminders related to established routines such as daily exercises or TV viewing times.\n  \n  2. **Scenario Practice:**\n     - Develop habit-forming exercises that integrate Alexa into daily routines, such as using it to check scores for sports games or reminders of upcoming sports events.\n\n  3. **Device Familiarization:**\n     - Daily practice with Alexa to improve response recognition and comfort level with devices.\n\nThis plan aims to build F.W.'s confidence in using Alexa independently, with an emphasis on integrating technology into their existing lifestyle seamlessly.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear insight into the patient's experiences and feelings towards the new Alexa device, as well as their interests and current use of technology. However, it could benefit from more detailed information on the patient's medical history, social history, and any relevant family history to provide a more comprehensive context.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the patient's current technology usage and their interaction with Alexa. It includes specific observations about task completion and training engagement. However, it lacks detailed quantitative data such as specific performance metrics or any physical examination findings that might be relevant.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment effectively synthesizes the subjective and objective information, highlighting the patient's adaptability and potential for mastering Alexa. It clearly identifies the patient's current stage in the learning process and their willingness to improve. However, it could be enhanced by including a more detailed analysis of potential barriers to learning or any cognitive assessments if applicable.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and tailored to the patient's needs, focusing on practical exercises and integration of Alexa into daily routines. It provides clear steps for the patient to follow, promoting independence and confidence. The plan could be improved by specifying a timeline for reassessment or including any additional resources or support systems available to the patient.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n \n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.779\nSpeaker 2: Alright, say these numbers after me. 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.289\nSpeaker 1: 4, 3, 7.\n \n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 5, 2, 4, 8.\n \n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850\nSpeaker 1: 5, 2, 4, 8, okay.\n \n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.639\nSpeaker 2: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.\n \n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.580\nSpeaker 1: 9, 3, 7, 5, 8.

That's what we want to see. And you know, that's how these tasks are. The the complexity increases and that's when yeah, alright let's keep going say, these words after me. book brush cup, lamp.\n\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.130\nSpeaker 1: What's the 3rd one? Covid. Same again.\n \n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.209\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm not allowed to say it. But I'm going to say it one more time and see if you're able to say them back to me. Okay, book, brush, cup, lamp.\n \n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.089\nSpeaker 1: Book. rush. lamp. I I didn't know what you said when you said cup.\n \n00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:03.970\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Alright. Okay. Let's see. Say, these after me. finger jar shoe phone stapler.\n \n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:19.829\nSpeaker 1: Finger jar. Stapler. And I missed, too.\n \n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Yes. that's totally fine. Okay. alright. Now, I want you to follow this direction. Okay. Touch your nose, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.040\nSpeaker 1: Touch your noise, point to me, blink twice.\n \n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:33.180\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Repeat the sentence after me. The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America Building on 12.th\n \n00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.740\nSpeaker 1: The restaurant is. The top floor is on the top floor of Bank of America, 12th Street.\n \n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:20.299\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. Alright! Alright! Repeat this after me. I drove down the highway. Got off at Stockton Boulevard and turned left into the parking lot.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how to start and drop down Stockington Boulevard and turn left into the parking lot.\n \n104\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.609\nSpeaker 2: Okay. right? I know that's a tough one, because it's so long. And it's like a direction that someone might give you a direction. And it's a lot of different ones in one one sentence. So it's it's a little hard, anyway. Alright, okay, moving on. Now, next, I'm going to say 3 words. I want you to remember them. Are you ready.\n \n00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.880\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.919\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here are the words, sock, blue and bed. Can you say them back to me?\n \n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.010\nSpeaker 1: Sat blue and bed.\n \n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.759\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll come back to these words, after doing a few more questions. Okay.\n \n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.410\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.060\nSpeaker 2: Alright! Alright!

That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**  \nPatient F.W. attended the virtual session independently, demonstrating a willingness to engage with the technology training exercises. F.W. mentioned being pleased with the pace at which Alexa delivers commands after slowing it down previously. Although comfortable with most tasks, F.W. finds certain features, like split screens for monthly views, challenging due to equipment limitations. F.W. enjoys the practical application of commands, particularly those that assist with daily tasks such as finding over-the-counter medications and receiving reminders for personal chores like laundry.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nThe session included practicing various voice commands using Alexa for daily tasks, medication management, and healthcare queries. F.W. successfully slowed down Alexa\u2019s speech rate and practiced commands like locating allergy medication, setting reminders for laundry and medication, and inquiries about stain removal and pain management. Challenges were noted in finding accurate information for stomach pains initially, indicating a need for rephrasing commands. F.W. also explored setting reminders for tasks and was able to practice commands for scheduling and finding healthcare providers.\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nF.W. is demonstrating adaptive skills in utilizing Alexa for assistance in daily activities, evidenced by F.W.\u2019s ability to formulate different commands successfully. While F.W. shows proficiency in some areas, there may be occasional miscommunication with Alexa, suggesting room for improving command phrasing. The patient's preference for customizing the wake-up word further indicates comfort with the technology. Continued practice with a variety of commands may enhance F.W.\u2019s confidence and autonomy in using Alexa for routine personal and healthcare tasks.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n1. Continue practicing voice commands with Alexa focusing on:\n   - Customizing commands for specific medication and healthcare provider searches.\n   - Utilizing reminders effectively for daily routines and tasks.\n2. Explore technical solutions for improving F.W.\u2019s interaction with smaller screens or seek equipment enhancements.\n3. Encourage using Alexa for learning new tasks like laundry management and specific household queries.\n4. Schedule follow-up sessions to address any ongoing challenges and ensure F.W. remains comfortable and proficient with the technology.\n5. Set up a home exercise program:\n   - Task 1: Command Alexa to set reminders for key tasks like medications and appointments.\n   - Task 2: Use Alexa for new information searches, ensuring accurate phrasing.\n   - Task 3: Practice setting and canceling alarms and reminders.\n   - Open Task: Set multiple reminders independently for personal and medical appointments.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a clear insight into the patient's experience and feelings towards using Alexa, highlighting both comfort and challenges. However, it could benefit from more detailed information about the patient's medical history or specific symptoms related to their condition.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the tasks practiced during the session and the patient's performance. It mentions specific commands and challenges faced, but lacks detailed quantitative data or specific observations that could provide a more comprehensive view of the patient's abilities.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment effectively summarizes the patient's progress and areas for improvement. It identifies specific skills and challenges, providing a clear picture of the patient's current status. However, it could be enhanced by including more detailed analysis or comparison to previous sessions.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and provides specific, actionable steps for the patient to continue improving their skills with Alexa. It includes a variety of tasks and follow-up actions, ensuring a comprehensive approach to the patient's ongoing development. However, it could be improved by specifying timelines or criteria for evaluating progress.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright!\n \n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:46.220\nSpeaker 1: But it didn't help last January I had speech therapy a year ago, January. and it didn't help sheep. she said, to practice her worksheets for Anamia. and it didn't help me. I I understand that. I have to have strategies to come up with words, or I want.\n \n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.609\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha? Yeah.\n \n00:01:48.186 --> 00:02:03.660\nSpeaker 1: But cognitive disabilities. Reading and writing and texting. I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them.

That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone.

So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3.

Sounds. \n \n00:42:31.010 --> 0:42:34.940 \nSpeaker 1: I'm a nurse, I where treat myself. \n \n00:42:35.840 --> 0:42:38.970 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Oh, okay, that means a lot. \n \n00:42:38.970 --> 0:42:39.600 \nSpeaker 1: Britain. \n \n00:42:39.880 --> 0:42:40.790 \nSpeaker 2: Right. \n \n00:42:41.180 --> 0:42:56.910 \nSpeaker 1: Finding amount of health. I have a therapist treating an itch, finding a dermatology. I have all of those done. They accept their products. \n \n00:42:57.260 --> 0:42:57.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:42:57.740 --> 0:43:00.009 \nSpeaker 1: I find everything. \n \n00:43:00.220 --> 0:43:16.020 \nSpeaker 2: Find everything. Okay. Alright. So I'm gonna mark all of those as twos. and then we'll move on to meal preparation. So, finding a meal using. Speaker 3. You think. \n \n00:43:16.020 --> 0:43:18.728 \nSpeaker 1: I already know how to cook. \n \n00:43:19.671 --> 0:43:39.580 \nSpeaker 2: Say you were in a different say, maybe you were in a different, you know, place or like, you know, you're traveling or something, and you needed, you know, to find a meal outside. Do you think you would be able to use Speaker 3 independently to find them find a find, a meal. or find a restaurant. \n \n00:43:40.580 --> 0:43:42.149 \nSpeaker 1: I use my phone. \n \n00:43:42.910 --> 0:43:45.080 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. But. \n \n00:43:45.633 --> 0:43:49.510 \nSpeaker 1: Lexa. I won't have it with me. \n \n00:43:50.360 --> 0:44:00.229 \nSpeaker 2: Right? So that's the good part about Speaker 3. You can also have a phone app of Speaker 3 on your phone. So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes. If there is like, you know anything that you want to do. we'll do. \n \n00:46:06.520 --> 0:46:09.080 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can do that. \n \n00:46:09.080 --> 0:46:16.239 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, the same with lock lactose, intolerant, and recipes as well. I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **SOAP Note**\n\n**Subjective (S):**\nThe patient, F.W., attended the virtual session and presented as cooperative and engaged. F.W. reported a structured daily routine involving substantial physical activity such as showering, exercising at the YMCA, and gardening. No current medications are prescribed, but he takes over-the-counter allergy medication. F.W. expressed feeling quite independent in self-care activities and managing healthy eating habits, primarily consuming fish over other meats. He has frequent medical appointments and acknowledges both his physical engagement in activities such as basketball and gardening, alongside managing injuries through medical consultations. His son recently tested positive for COVID, prompting F.W. and his family to practice precautions, including mask-wearing and social distancing. F.W. seemed motivated to manage health-related tasks, suggesting interest in potentially learning more about using technology for scheduling and reminders.\n\n**Objective (O):**\nF.W. demonstrated an ability to use Alexa for playing movie trailers, although assistance was required to refine commands. He engages in managing his self-care with minimal aid, including shaving and frequent showers due to his active lifestyle. He attends regular medical check-ups and follows through with necessary health protocols like fasting before blood tests. Technology use includes setting reminders through his Alexa device, aiming to enhance utility for calendar events. Currently, F.W.'s son has a COVID-19 infection, and protective measures are being adhered to at home. Learning objectives today included improving F.W.'s proficiency in using Alexa for reminders and scheduling via split-screen operations, which remains an area for improvement.\n\n**Assessment (A):**\nF.W. maintains a good level of independence in conducting daily activities and managing his self-care without assistance. While he has successfully integrated physical exercise into his routine, occasional injuries from activities challenge this independence, requiring medical intervention. His engagement with technology like Alexa reflects an interest in using it for self-management tasks; however, he requires further training to optimize usage, specifically in executing and understanding certain commands related to scheduling and viewing the full calendar. His vigilance in taking COVID-19 precautions showcases awareness and responsibility in managing his immediate health environment.\n\n**Plan (P):**\n- Continue self-care routines and encourage injury prevention strategies during physical activities.\n- Provide additional training sessions focused on improving the use of Alexa for setting reminders and accessing split-screen functionalities pertaining to calendar events.\n- Monitor and support in managing COVID-19 precautions at home, ensuring awareness and adherence to health guidelines.\n- Review and assist in establishing any additional self-care technology needs or challenges, encouraging independence through appropriate tech solutions.\n\n**Home Exercise Program:**\n1. **Technology and Scheduling:**\n   - Practice with Alexa to set up and delete reminders: \"Alexa, remind me to take my allergy medication at 8 p.m.\"\n   - Assist in finding solutions for achieving the split-screen view on Alexa for calendar access.\n\n2. **Physical Activity:**\n   - Maintain safe levels of physical activities like basketball and gardening, with a focus on injury prevention techniques.\n\n3. **Health Monitoring:**\n   - Continue attending medical appointments and adhere to prescribed health measures for routine health checks and managing potential injuries.\n\n4. **COVID-19 Precautions:**\n   - Sustain protective measures at home, especially while caring for a family member with COVID-19.\n\nF.W. and his wife are encouraged to seek any required assistance and continue actively participating in self-care management routines.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's daily routine, health habits, and current concerns. It effectively captures the patient's independence, physical activities, and recent exposure to COVID-19. However, it could benefit from more specific details about the patient's medical history and any previous health issues.\n\n**Objective (O):** 7/10  \nThe objective section outlines the patient's use of technology and self-care practices. It mentions the patient's ability to use Alexa and adherence to health protocols. However, it lacks specific measurable data such as vital signs or recent lab results, which would provide a more complete picture of the patient's current health status.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment accurately reflects the patient's level of independence and engagement with technology. It identifies areas for improvement, such as optimizing the use of Alexa for scheduling. The assessment could be enhanced by including a more detailed analysis of the patient's physical health and any potential risks associated with his activities.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured and addresses key areas for the patient's continued health management, including technology use, physical activity, and COVID-19 precautions. It provides clear and actionable steps for the patient to follow. The inclusion of a home exercise program is a strong point, though it could be more detailed in terms of specific exercises or injury prevention strategies.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}

The SOAP note is a way for healthcare workers to document in a structured and organized way.[1][2][3]\nThis widely adopted structural SOAP note was theorized by Larry Weed almost 50 years ago. It reminds clinicians of specific tasks while providing a framework for evaluating information. It also provides a cognitive framework for clinical reasoning. The SOAP note helps guide healthcare workers use their clinical reasoning to assess, diagnose, and treat a patient based on the information provided by them. SOAP notes are an essential piece of information about the health status of the patient as well as a communication document between health professionals. The structure of documentation is a checklist that serves as a cognitive aid and a potential index to retrieve information for learning from the record.[4][5][6]\n\nFunction\nStructure\nThe 4 headings of a SOAP note are Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. Each heading is described below.\nSubjective\nThis is the first heading of the SOAP note. Documentation under this heading comes from the \"subjective\" experiences, personal views or feelings of a patient or someone close to them. In the inpatient setting, interim information is included here. This section provides context for the Assessment and Plan.\nChief Complaint (CC)\nThe CC or presenting problem is reported by the patient. This can be a symptom, condition, previous diagnosis or another short statement that describes why the patient is presenting today. The CC is similar to the title of a paper, allowing the reader to get a sense of what the rest of the document will entail.\nExamples: chest pain, decreased appetite, shortness of breath.\n\nHowever, a patient may have multiple CC's, and their first complaint may not be the most significant one. Thus, physicians should encourage patients to state all of their problems, while paying attention to detail to discover the most compelling problem. Identifying the main problem must occur to perform effective and efficient diagnosis.\nHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\n\nThe HPI begins with a simple one line opening statement including the patient's age, sex and reason for the visit.\nExample: 47-year old female presenting with abdominal pain.\n\nThis is the section where the patient can elaborate on their chief complaint. An acronym often used to organize the HPI is termed \"OLDCARTS\":\nOnset: When did the CC begin?\nLocation: Where is the CC located?\nDuration: How long has the CC been going on for?\nCharacterization: How does the patient describe the CC?\nAlleviating and Aggravating factors: What makes the CC better? Worse?\nRadiation: Does the CC move or stay in one location?\nTemporal factor: Is the CC worse (or better) at a certain time of the day?\nSeverity: Using a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, 10 being the worst, how does the patient rate the CC?\nIt is important for clinicians to focus on the quality and clarity of their patient's notes, rather than include excessive detail.\nHistory\n\nMedical history: Pertinent current or past medical conditions\nSurgical history: Try to include the year of the surgery and surgeon if possible.\nFamily history: Include pertinent family history. Avoid documenting the medical history of every person in the patient's family.\nSocial History: An acronym that may be used here is HEADSS which stands for Home and Environment; Education, Employment, Eating; Activities; Drugs; Sexuality; and Suicide/Depression.\nReview of Systems (ROS)\nThis is a system based list of questions that help uncover symptoms not otherwise mentioned by the patient.\nGeneral: Weight loss, decreased appetite\nGastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, hematochezia\nMusculoskeletal: Toe pain, decreased right shoulder range of motion\n\nCurrent Medications, Allergies\nCurrent medications and allergies may be listed under the Subjective or Objective sections. However, it is important that with any medication documented, to include the medication name, dose, route, and how often.\n\nExample: Motrin 600 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours for 5 days\n\nObjective\nThis section documents the objective data from the patient encounter. This includes:\n\nVital signs\nPhysical exam findings\nLaboratory data\nImaging results\nOther diagnostic data\nRecognition and review of the documentation of other clinicians.\n\nA common mistake is distinguishing between symptoms and signs. Symptoms are the patient's subjective description and should be documented under the subjective heading, while a sign is an objective finding related to the associated symptom reported by the patient. An example of this is a patient stating he has \"stomach pain,\" which is a symptom, documented under the subjective heading. Versus \"abdominal tenderness to palpation,\" an objective sign documented under the objective heading.\nAssessment\nThis section documents the synthesis of \"subjective\" and \"objective\" evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. This is the assessment of the patient's status through analysis of the problem, possible interaction of the problems, and changes in the status of the problems. Elements include the following.\nProblem\nList the problem list in order of importance. A problem is often known as a diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThis is a list of the different possible diagnosis, from most to least likely, and the thought process behind this list. This is where the decision-making process is explained in depth. Included should be the possibility of other diagnoses that may harm the patient, but are less likely.\nExample: Problem 1, Differential Diagnoses, Discussion, Plan for problem 1 (described in the plan below). Repeat for additional problems\nPlan\nThis section details the need for additional testing and consultation with other clinicians to address the patient's illnesses. It also addresses any additional steps being taken to treat the patient. This section helps future physicians understand what needs to be done next. For each problem:\n\tState which testing is needed and the rationale for choosing each test to resolve diagnostic ambiguities; ideally what the next step would be if positive or negative\nTherapy needed (medications)\n\nSpecialist referral(s) or consults\nPatient education, counseling\n\nA comprehensive SOAP note has to take into account all subjective and objective information, and accurately assess it to create the patient-specific assessment and plan.\n\nIssues of Concern\nThe order in which a medical note is written has been a topic of discussion. While a SOAP note follows the order Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, it is possible, and often beneficial, to rearrange the order. For instance, rearranging the order to form APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) provides the information most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be found quickly, shortening the time required for the clinician to find a colleague's assessment and plan. One study found that the APSO order was better than the typical SOAP note order in terms of speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care. Re-ordering into the APSO note is only an effort to streamline communication, not eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\nA weakness of the SOAP note is the inability to document changes over time. In many clinical situations, evidence changes over time, requiring providers to reconsider diagnoses and treatments. An important gap in the SOAP model is that it does not explicitly integrate time into its cognitive framework. Extensions to the SOAP model to include this gap are acronyms such as SOAPE, with the letter E as an explicit reminder to assess how well the plan has worked.[7][8] [9][10]\n\nClinical Significance\nMedical documentation now serves multiple needs and, as a result, medical notes have expanded in both length and breadth compared to fifty years ago. Medical notes have evolved into electronic documentation to accommodate these needs. However, an unintended consequence of electronic documentation is the ability to incorporate large volumes of data easily. These data\u00ad filled notes risk burdening a busy clinician if the data are not useful. As importantly, the patient may be harmed if the information is inaccurate. It is essential to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more immediately available. The advantage of a SOAP note is to organize this information such that it is located in easy to find places. The more succinct yet thorough a SOAP note is, the easier it is for clinicians to follow. and the conversation the SOAP note is summarizing to find missing details: Speaker 1: Patient L.V.G.\nSpeaker 2: Clinician\nSpeaker 3: Patient L.V.G.\u2019s Alexa\n\nEBVTT\n-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ---------------------------------------------- \n00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.360\nSpeaker 1: Yes, when they say tell me all the nouns or the words you can say with a letter S in 1 min, I can't come up with more than 4 or 5.\n \n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay.\n \n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.545\nSpeaker 1: That's That's how Anania shows up and\n \n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.480\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n \n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.692\nSpeaker 1: I play bridge online with my husband, and we have one something. We do, all right. and I don't have any cognitive disabilities yet, but I'm struggling to speak. And That's it.\n \n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.229\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay? Alright. Do you? Get any any there? Any speech? Therapy right now or no? No. Okay. And have you ever gotten any.\n \n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.460\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n \n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.210\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

I have I functioned pretty well.\n \n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:29.349\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Gotcha, alright. So let's get started here. And we will find out all more about cognitive and communication deficits. So some of the tasks might be pretty easy. Some might be a little difficult. But we'll see where that's what we want to see. Exactly how you're doing currently. And then we can go from there. Okay.\n \n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.280\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n \n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:53.979\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay. So let's get started. So here, the 1st subtest we have. I'm going to say some numbers, words and sentences, and I want you to say them after me. Exactly as I have said them. I will also ask you to follow some directions, and we'll go from there, and we'll we'll follow with some different tasks. Are you ready.\n \n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.980\nSpeaker 1: Yes.

Are you ready. \n \n00:33:12.760 --> 0:33:13.165 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:33:13.570 --> 0:33:42.610 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, here it is. Anna's husband gave her a beautiful ruby ring for her birthday that night she decided to wear the rain, but she couldn't find it. Anna searched everywhere, and then began to cry.

So that that is, those are all of the subtests that we needed to do. alright, the next thing we have is. let me share my screen, so I will able to explain better what happened there. Sorry about that. Let me see what's going on there. Give me a second. hmm! Let's see. Sorry about that, Speaker 1. I'm just gonna alright. Can you see my screen. \n \n00:35:41.410 --> 0:35:42.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:35:42.370 --> 0:37:15.419 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is So while we are going to be doing the training. we have every week, we have different kind of activity of daily living. That we're gonna focus on. So each week there are different. Commands. Voice commands that we teach you. That you will use with the device to make to sort of make your life easier in a way. So what we're doing here is these are some of the tasks that you'll be doing during using your Speaker 3 device. What we want to do pre-test pre training is whether, for example, setting up an appointment using Speaker 3, whether you think right now, if you would be able to execute the command independently, without any help from your you know your husband or your family. Versus like. You know whether you would need some assistance from your family, or you can score a 0 for yourself. If you think that you cannot execute the command, and you would definitely need the help of your family. Okay? So, for example, so for setting up an appointment, using Speaker 3, so using voice commands. Do you think you would be able to do it independently. or you would need some help. \n \n00:37:23.760 --> 0:37:27.900 \nSpeaker 1: but Lexa. and understands me. \n \n00:37:29.330 --> 0:37:29.660 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:37:29.660 --> 0:37:34.890 \nSpeaker 1: And people don't understand me. On the phone. \n \n00:37:35.940 --> 0:37:37.330 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. my. \n \n00:37:37.330 --> 0:38:00.829 \nSpeaker 1: I struggle to be understood on the phone. They're impatient and wantic fast answers. And I I have to tell them I've got aphasia. And but I, Speaker 3, might not understand me. \n \n00:38:01.290 --> 0:38:36.479 \nSpeaker 2: Okay? So that's what we wanna do for each of these tasks that we want you to kind of. you know, on a scale of 0 to 2 0 being that you cannot execute it at all. and one being that you need assistance, and 2 being that you want, you, you think that you would be able to execute it independently? So you want to sort of rate yourself right now and then. We will compare this to when we're done with the training so as to see like what the differences are. Okay. So say for. \n \n00:38:36.480 --> 0:38:36.920 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:38:36.920 --> 0:38:48.210 \nSpeaker 2: You had to set up an appointment, or a doctor's appointment, or something using Speaker 3. Do you think you would be able to do it independently, or you think you would need an assistance some assistance from the caregiver. \n \n00:38:52.870 --> 0:38:55.129 \nSpeaker 1: How soon will we get it? \n \n00:38:57.810 --> 0:39:02.714 \nSpeaker 2: you should be getting it before your 1st training. That's what \n \n00:39:03.160 --> 0:39:03.870 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:39:03.870 --> 0:39:07.999 \nSpeaker 2: Good. That that's what we aim to do. \n \n00:39:09.380 --> 0:39:13.410 \nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can execute it. \n \n00:39:14.580 --> 0:39:16.140 \nSpeaker 2: You think you can execute it? \n \n00:39:16.700 --> 0:39:18.679 \nSpeaker 1: If they understand me. \n \n00:39:18.820 --> 0:39:26.909 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, so independently right, like, no help from your husband or something.

Do you think you would be able to use Speaker 3 independently to find them find a find, a meal. or find a restaurant. \n \n00:43:40.580 --> 0:43:42.149 \nSpeaker 1: I use my phone. \n \n00:43:42.910 --> 0:43:45.080 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. But. \n \n00:43:45.633 --> 0:43:49.510 \nSpeaker 1: Lexa. I won't have it with me. \n \n00:43:50.360 --> 0:44:00.229 \nSpeaker 2: Right? So that's the good part about Speaker 3. You can also have a phone app of Speaker 3 on your phone. So you. \n \n00:44:00.230 --> 0:44:01.400 \nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. \n \n00:44:01.400 --> 0:44:02.470 \nSpeaker 2: On the go to. \n \n00:44:03.250 --> 0:44:10.610 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay. I can use Speaker 3 when I leave it here and go to Florida. \n \n00:44:12.515 --> 0:44:13.060 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. \n \n00:44:13.060 --> 0:44:15.343 \nSpeaker 1: You only have. Yes. \n \n00:44:17.080 --> 0:44:31.519 \nSpeaker 2: And all, both your your device that you will receive and the phone can be synced. So both of them will sort of have the same information. so that you get the correct information for yourself. \n \n00:44:31.520 --> 0:44:36.980 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can set it up individually. \n \n00:44:37.450 --> 0:44:46.789 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? Alright. So finding a recipe using Speaker 3. you think you'll be able to do that no problem. \n \n00:44:49.050 --> 0:44:49.890 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:44:49.890 --> 0:44:53.439 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. asking for ingredients. \n \n00:44:55.880 --> 0:44:58.219 \nSpeaker 1: Speaker 3. I can do that. \n \n00:44:58.220 --> 0:45:04.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. finding grams of sugar for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:05.350 --> 0:45:06.520 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:06.700 --> 0:45:11.400 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. finding number of calories for a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:12.670 --> 0:45:13.760 \nSpeaker 1: I can do that. \n \n00:45:15.430 --> 0:45:25.700 \nSpeaker 2: Alright! Here we go. finding level of sodium in a certain type of food. \n \n00:45:29.130 --> 0:45:53.830 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I set up Speaker 3 to command her her to find sodium in a certain kind of food. I will set it up. Speaker 3. Tell me that Graham's of sodium n asparagus. \n \n00:45:53.830 --> 0:45:55.621 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right, \n \n00:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.440 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. \n \n00:45:57.440 --> 0:46:06.520 \nSpeaker 2: Perfect finding gluten, free vegan, vegetarian recipes.

I guess I'm guessing. \n \n00:46:16.240 --> 0:46:24.190 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm finding suit food subs. I don't need those, but I can find them. \n \n00:46:24.190 --> 0:46:29.259 \nSpeaker 2: Find it. If you have someone who's coming over who needs for food substitutions, you would still be able to. \n \n00:46:29.260 --> 0:46:30.479 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, bye. \n \n00:46:30.830 --> 0:46:37.539 \nSpeaker 2: All right asking for whether do you think you'll be able to do that independently, or you need help? \n \n00:46:38.890 --> 0:46:41.070 \nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need help. \n \n00:46:41.220 --> 0:46:43.120 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. \n \n00:46:43.120 --> 0:46:48.219 \nSpeaker 1: Is that everything I've seen? I don't need help. \n \n00:46:48.500 --> 0:46:55.259 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright. Same with like the asking for UV index or weekly forecast. All of those. \n \n00:46:55.260 --> 0:46:57.396 \nSpeaker 1: I don't go out. \n \n00:46:57.930 --> 0:46:58.540 \nSpeaker 2: This is. \n \n00:46:58.690 --> 0:47:02.339 \nSpeaker 1: In the sun. I had the son. \n \n00:47:02.650 --> 0:47:07.540 \nSpeaker 2: How about asking for date? You think you'd be able to do that if you needed to. \n \n00:47:07.540 --> 0:47:08.280 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:08.530 --> 0:47:13.290 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Asking Speaker 3 for your to do list. \n \n00:47:15.890 --> 0:47:27.860 \nSpeaker 1: I have a list already. But I can ask Speaker 3 to remind me and put it in there. \n \n00:47:28.030 --> 0:47:43.050 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can. You can just sort of use your commands, and you can make a list for yourself, and then when you need it. It will pull the list up. You think you'd be able to do do that on your own. \n \n00:47:43.610 --> 0:47:44.320 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:44.810 --> 0:47:48.749 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Adding an event to your calendar. \n \n00:47:51.380 --> 0:47:52.130 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:47:52.320 --> 0:47:57.050 \nSpeaker 2: And okay. Alright! Removing an event from your calendar. \n \n00:47:57.510 --> 0:48:03.700 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. I keep. everything you. \n \n00:48:04.150 --> 0:48:09.540 \nSpeaker 2: Everything. All of that. You were able to do that, asking for flash debriefing, stopping. \n \n00:48:09.900 --> 0:48:15.390 \nSpeaker 1: I don't know what is flow. I should debriefing. \n \n00:48:15.390 --> 0:48:35.140 \nSpeaker 2: So flash debriefing is like news. Recent news for you. That you can ask. And it it is sort of based on the location you were at, because it's taking the location that you're at and giving you the news accordingly. So. \n \n00:48:36.020 --> 0:48:36.460 \nSpeaker 1: Yeah. \n \n00:48:36.460 --> 0:48:37.360 \nSpeaker 2: I think, yeah. \n \n00:48:37.360 --> 0:48:47.430 \nSpeaker 1: I can ask for flash debriefing, and I stop it. But I may not be able to. Next year. \n \n00:48:48.630 --> 0:48:50.640 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. okay. \n \n00:48:51.940 --> 0:48:54.190 \nSpeaker 1: What is audio calling? \n \n00:48:54.870 --> 0:49:15.620 \nSpeaker 2: So you can use the app, Speaker 3 on, even on your on the device or on your phone and you can make a call to someone else who has an Speaker 3 app still. So, using a voice command, you were sort of calling someone from your device or your phone. \n \n00:49:16.860 --> 0:49:29.780 \nSpeaker 1: Well, I have to program it, and. In there. I can program my doctor's phone numbers. \n \n00:49:30.732 --> 0:49:41.299 \nSpeaker 2: You can definitely. But then again, at the same time, your your doctors offices, or they, they should also have the app. \n \n00:49:42.760 --> 0:49:44.260 \nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. \n \n00:49:44.630 --> 0:50:04.840 \nSpeaker 2: But more so for family like, you know, audio and video calling, using your voice commands and stuff, like always like going in and calling especially times when your your hands are tied, like you know you're cooking, or you know your it's you're doing something with your hands, and you needed. \n \n00:50:04.840 --> 0:50:05.710 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:06.180 --> 0:50:11.890 \nSpeaker 2: Then that's when we usually do that. But do you think you would be able to do it once it's programmed. \n \n00:50:12.170 --> 0:50:13.100 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:13.100 --> 0:50:15.210 \nSpeaker 2: I'll have alright! \n \n00:50:15.210 --> 0:50:17.490 \nSpeaker 1: And video calling as well. \n \n00:50:18.149 --> 0:50:27.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yup, alright. And last one is entertainment playing a video, using Speaker 3, do you think you can do that. \n \n00:50:28.510 --> 0:50:31.879 \nSpeaker 1: Yes, if if I program it. \n \n00:50:32.290 --> 0:50:36.449 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Playing music, using Speaker 3. \n \n00:50:37.180 --> 0:50:37.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:38.120 --> 0:50:41.490 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. Increasing the volume. \n \n00:50:42.200 --> 0:50:42.920 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:43.550 --> 0:50:46.500 \nSpeaker 2: Okay, decreasing the volume. \n \n00:50:47.670 --> 0:50:48.420 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:48.630 --> 0:50:53.360 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. alright pausing a video or music. \n \n00:50:54.870 --> 0:50:55.650 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:50:56.930 --> 0:51:00.440 \nSpeaker 2: Playing a video or a music. \n \n00:51:00.620 --> 0:51:01.530 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:02.040 --> 0:51:09.090 \nSpeaker 2: Starting over music, or any any song or podcast or video. \n \n00:51:09.890 --> 0:51:10.285 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:12.150 --> 0:51:13.560 \nSpeaker 2: Fast forwarding. \n \n00:51:14.220 --> 0:51:14.980 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:16.410 --> 0:51:17.600 \nSpeaker 2: Rewinding. \n \n00:51:18.470 --> 0:51:19.220 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:20.610 --> 0:51:24.700 \nSpeaker 2: Playing the music over, or a video over again. \n \n00:51:25.380 --> 0:51:26.120 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:26.850 --> 0:51:27.450 \nSpeaker 2: Okay. \n \n00:51:27.450 --> 0:51:30.370 \nSpeaker 1: If it's programmed, I can do that. \n \n00:51:30.370 --> 0:51:34.740 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Alright. \n \n00:51:34.740 --> 0:51:39.770 \nSpeaker 1: I already do all of these things on my phone or ipad. \n \n00:51:40.190 --> 0:51:53.460 \nSpeaker 2: Right? Right? And you're at that point. You are using your fingers to sort of navigate through like it's a visual that you're using and not the audio, though right like you were. \n \n00:51:53.460 --> 0:51:54.350 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:51:54.350 --> 0:52:09.290 \nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So that's you're gonna be using learning to use voice commands. For when you when we do this training, so it's sort of an added advantage, I would say for you. 2 2 norms. \n \n00:52:09.290 --> 0:52:11.760 \nSpeaker 1: Struggling with my voice. \n \n00:52:13.240 --> 0:52:32.249 \nSpeaker 2: yeah. And I think that would also help you sort of practice some of those things that are harder right now. And there are a lot of different things that Speaker 3 can do. For example, just communicating with. It's almost like communicating with a stranger right like, because it's. \n \n00:52:32.400 --> 0:52:33.030 \nSpeaker 1: Yes. \n \n00:52:33.030 --> 0:52:46.170 \nSpeaker 2: It's not understanding you, as your family would understand always, so that might be of use. and definitely. \n\n\n Don't add anything of your own.Give a score out of 10 for each category S,O,A and P.\nQuery: **Subjective (S):**  \nThe session was attended by patient F.W., a sports and politics enthusiast who does not use medication regularly, except for allergy relief, where he uses Allegra. He reports practicing commands learned during previous sessions three to four times a week. His interests include listening to podcasts on politics and sports, particularly baseball and the Olympics, although family members are less enthusiastic about the latter. F.W. enjoys engaging in activities such as golf, card games, and spending time with his grandchildren. He does not regularly ask Siri random questions but showed curiosity in utilizing his Echo device to inquire about sports scores and weather updates.\n\n**Objective (O):**  \nUser engagement focused on practicing voice commands with the Echo device, including creating and managing medication lists, asking for current sports scores, weather forecasts, and news updates. F.W. successfully engaged the Echo device to:\n- Add Nyquil to his medication list with minimal guidance.\n- Access current weather conditions and forecasts for the week in Naperville and Los Angeles.\n- Check sports updates, including baseball scores for the St. Louis Cardinals.\n- Get news briefings related to political events and figures of interest.\nTechnical assistance was required to remove unintended entries on his medication list due to phrasing discrepancies, which were resolved by exploring alternative command structures (e.g., using \"remove\").\n\n**Assessment (A):**  \nF.W. demonstrated progress in employing voice commands effectively after initial trial and error. His ability to modify command phrasing suggests developing adaptability in interacting with the Echo device. Despite not typically questioning his assistant technology for information, F.W. remained engaged in learning new ways to extract information through practice. Family support, while essential for now, might lessen as F.W.\u2019s proficiency increases. Interest in political affairs and sports remains a motivating factor which can enhance his interaction with the device.\n\n**Plan (P):**  \n- Continue engaging F.W. in voice command exercises focusing on consistency and expanding the range of questions.\n- Encourage daily practice with the Echo device, incorporating his interest areas such as politics, sports, and weather, to maintain motivation.\n- Address any device execution issues by exploring varied command structures and phrasing.\n- Gradual phasing toward more independent usage, with reduced family assistance over time.\n- Follow-up sessions to reinforce learned commands and introduce new functions to broaden F.W.\u2019s utilization of the technology.\n- Suggested home exercises:\n  - Practice: Setting reminders and alarms using varied phrasings.\n  - Engage with sports and news updates using Echo.\n  - Try setting up hypothetical medication reminders, aligning with scenarios for possible future needs.\n\nResponse: **Subjective (S):** 8/10  \nThe subjective section provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's interests, activities, and current use of technology, which is relevant to the session's focus. However, it could benefit from more specific details about the patient's primary concerns or goals for the session.\n\n**Objective (O):** 9/10  \nThe objective section effectively outlines the patient's engagement with the Echo device and the specific tasks performed. It clearly describes the patient's successes and challenges, providing a good basis for assessment. Including more quantitative data, such as the number of successful commands versus attempts, could enhance this section.\n\n**Assessment (A):** 8/10  \nThe assessment accurately reflects the patient's progress and adaptability in using voice commands. It connects the patient's interests to their motivation, which is insightful. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating any barriers to progress or areas needing further development.\n\n**Plan (P):** 9/10  \nThe plan is well-structured, with clear, actionable steps for the patient to continue improving their skills with the Echo device. It aligns well with the patient's interests and current abilities. Including a timeline for achieving specific milestones or a method for tracking progress could make the plan more robust.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}
