      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

      "**Problem 1: Speech and Language Deficit (likely Primary Progressive Aphasia - PPA)**\n",
      "- The primary issue is a language disorder characterized by difficulty with word retrieval (anomia), evident when the patient struggles to generate nouns starting with specific letters or remember verbal sequences given by the clinician. These symptoms align with characteristics of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a neurological syndrome characterized by gradual deterioration of language capabilities.\n",
      "- The patient demonstrates awareness and insight into her communication difficulties. Despite previously unhelpful speech therapy, she continues to engage in constructive activities for cognitive stimulation, such as playing bridge and painting.\n",
      "- Differential Diagnosis:\n",
      "  - **PPA**: Most likely, given the described symptom pattern and patient history. PPA's symptom of sometimes saying the opposite of what you mean (e.g., yes for no) was noted.\n",
      "  - **Mild Cognitive Impairment**: Considered but less likely given cognitive tasks performance consistency.\n",
      "  - **Aphasia due to other neurological conditions**: Considered but less likely without additional evidence of other neurological impairments or sudden onset related to a cerebrovascular event.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan for Speech and Language Deficit/PPA:**\n",
      "1. **Speech Therapy Referral**: Re-evaluation by a speech-language pathologist to tailor a specific intervention program. The goal is to explore alternative strategies to manage aphasia symptoms proactively.\n",
      "   - Focus on strategies for improving word retrieval and communication through practical and assistive approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cognitive and Speech Stimulation Activities**: Encourage continued engagement in stimulating activities like playing bridge and painting. Highlight activities that incorporate verbal expression and memory tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technological Assistance and Training**:\n",
      "   - Implementation of adaptive technology training using voice-activated systems like Alexa to support communication and personal management tasks. Encourage the use of this technology for setting reminders, finding recipes, or simple dialogue tasks that could improve verbal interaction capability.\n",
      "   - Training should focus on helping the patient leverage the device to perform tasks requiring verbal communication, thereby practicing speech in a structured, supportive environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitor and Educate**: \n",
      "   - Educate the patient and her caregivers about PPA to facilitate understanding of its progression and encouraging adaptive communication techniques.\n",
      "   - Regular monitoring of language capabilities and adjustment of strategies as necessary, based on any progression or change in symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Follow-up Appointments**: Schedule follow-up evaluations to measure progress and reassess therapy effectiveness. Adjust therapeutic interventions as needed based on continued patient input and test performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consider Neuropsychological Assessment**:\n",
      "   - Exploring comprehensive assessment could provide additional insights into cognitive domains impacted and further confirm the PPA diagnosis, if not previously confirmed, thus aiding in managing the condition.\n",

      "00:03:39 Speaker 3\n",
      "I don't need to, but maybe I will in the future. I remember well presently, but I, I use my phone to set my appointments, to schedule a time to get up or this meeting time to alert me.\n",
      "00:04:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "So you, you do use your phone sometimes to set alarms. OK.\n",
      "00:04:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:04:18 Speaker 1\n",

      "Yes, I use a physical appointment, paper appointment schedule.\n",
      "00:04:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. And then what type of appointments do you need to schedule and keep up? So kind of like when you think about your day-to-day, are there any specific appointments you have?\n",
      "00:05:02 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes, I have a therapist I see every week. I have a cleaning girl that comes twice a month and I put that on my calendar. When she's going to come. And I have a haircuts and meetings with girls and eye appointments and dental appointments and meetings when I want to socialize. And meetings, going out to dinner with friends. I keep all that on my calendar. I say to my husband, you can know where I've gone when you look on my calendar.\n",
      "00:06:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "So you have it all written down? \n",
      "00:06:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes. \n",
      "00:06:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "That’s awesome. And then so what kind of events do you have for, you mentioned the social events? What kind of events do you typically go to and does that happen frequently?\n",
      "00:06:24 Speaker 3\n",
      "No, not so frequently anymore. Because I can't. My husband is away for the summer and I'm not going anymore to our summer residence. It has stairs that don’t accommodate. My knees won’t go up and down the stairs anymore. And I recently I’ve gotten together the neighbors out in the in the summer. I text them when I want to get together for evening cocktails and see if they might come. And I have bridge groups at, in Florida. And I have dinner plans in Florida.\n",
      "00:07:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, awesome. And then can you think of 10 scenarios to complete the sentence. I want to blank. So kind of thinking about this week's training about setting reminders and setting schedules. Can you think of some situations that are meaningful to you that you want to work on, specifically in this training? I want to set a reminder for blank.\n",
      "00:08:03 Speaker 3\n",
      "To get my script tomorrow at Walgreens. And my son is going to come home from a trip on Sunday and we have to change cars. Vivian is coming on Monday. That's the cleaning girl. Alexa is being delivered on Tuesday. Strategies for communication. On Tuesday, from 2:00 to 3:00 for aphasia group and I am. Trash going out on Tuesdays and I have a haircut on Wednesday this week. And my book is due on Thursday and I'm seeing my therapist on Thursday and I'm going to you, tune in to you on Thursday next week. My schedule is very full next week.\n",
      "00:09:24 Speaker 1\n",
      "I was gonna say, you have a tight schedule. So can I, if you don't mind, can I see what, do you have that all written down in like one piece of. OK, so like on your week. OK, perfect.\n",
      "00:09:43 Speaker 3\n",
      "I have a big calendar space. It's two by two inches and I can write a lot in there.\n",
      "00:09:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. Do you like to set reminders for when you go grocery shopping or certain reminders for what you need to buy or anything?\n",
      "00:10:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes, I make a list.\n",
      "00:10:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "And is that on your calendar that you just showed me too, or do you have a separate notebook.\n",
      "00:10:16 Speaker 3\n",
      "No, it's a separate list, but I would like Alexa to record what's on the list and take it. I'm very forgetful about my lists and I would like Alexa on my phone to record this list and I have to say to my husband, I forgot my list. I'm out at the library and I I'm going to the store right now. I forgot my list and he takes a picture of it and I, I pick it up on my phone. I would like to have Alexa have my list and I can pick it out on the app.\n",
      "00:11:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, I know that's really informative cause Alexa can definitely do everything you just mentioned and having like 1 cohesive place where you can have both your reminders and like a to do list. I think that would be a really good scenario to practice on. That I know when we were doing the introductions, you mentioned how one of your goals is to communicate with your husband better. Can you explain more on that and what you're kind of thinking of how Alexa and also this training could help with that?\n",
      "00:11:45 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes. I have, I have trouble speaking clearly and it's deteriorating rapidly. And I need help with communicating with my husband. He doesn't hear very well. He doesn't pick up the, my articulations. I have to repeat this three times for him to get it. I get it. I hope it that Alexa will. I will. I hope the training will get Alexa to speak for me.\n",
      "00:12:43 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:12:44 Speaker 3\n",

      "Will Alexa call the fire department? I have a fear that my husband will have a stroke and I can't speak on the phone. Can I program in the fire department? In Omaha and Florida and ask them to come.\n",
      "00:13:28 Speaker 1\n",
      "I do know that you can't use Alexa to directly call, but you do, there's like a emergency assist subscription, so that's.\n",
      "00:13:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:13:42 Speaker 1\n",
      "A home Security feature where I think purchase that. You can use. You can like call Alexa for help and then that might connect you to like, like, the appropriate.\n",

      "I have a fall back plan that I will knock on the neighbors door and alert them in an emergency.\n",
      "00:14:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, but I think.\n",
      "00:14:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "I have a whiteboard. A whiteboard. When my husband is not clear when I'm saying.\n",
      "00:14:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's a good, that's definitely a good strategy. I think those are all our questions so we are. We'll probably go back to the main room soon, but was there anything specifically about the screening you want to share or kind of maybe your reservations about it or like what things you're excited about?\n",
      "00:14:45 Speaker 3\n",
      "I don't know about Alexa. I haven't experienced Alexa. I don't know what she's capable of. I'm inexperienced. I will be surprised. What her capabilities are and what the device is capable of. And I don't wanna play music. Or call somebody.\n",
      "00:15:22 Speaker 1\n",
      "So what do you think out of the kind of the weeks this training? Will provide which week are you looking most forward to?\n",

      "Entertain. Is is. Week 3 was about whatever.\n",

      "Awesome.\n",
      "00:16:35 Speaker 3\n",
      "She can a record and Alexa, what I want to do each week, whether medication.\n",
      "00:16:48 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes, definitely. And then so that would be week 3, we can definitely go into that deeper when that week comes and then see like what you're specifically needing. And I do know that .\n",
      "00:17:05 Speaker 3\n",
      "Translated to my needs.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.

      "They're from the library, a hardcover.\n",
      "00:12:41 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, great. And then, can you think of around 10 scenarios completing the sentence I want to watch blank, or I want to listen to blank, for us so that we can get an idea of the activities that you like to do for entertainment?\n",
      "00:13:08 Speaker 1\n",
      "I'd like to, what did you say? I like to read what, I like to watch what?\n",
      "00:13:18 Speaker 2\n",
      "So for example, it can be, I want to watch a mystery show. Or I want to play bridge. So trying to, we want you to try to think of some other things to fill in that blank. So we can get an idea of what other entertainment or leisure activities you might like to do.\n",
      "00:13:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. I want to umm. Have my e-mail available to me. I want to e-mail some friends and Stan and contact with them on messages. And I want to. It's so hard for me at night. It’s 7:30. I can't think this late.\n",

      "Yeah, that's OK. We know it's a difficult time for you and we really appreciate the effort that you're putting in so far. So, if yeah, if you're not able to identify more scenarios, we've already been able to get a lot from what you've answered earlier, so thank you so much for that.\n",
      "00:14:53 Speaker 1\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:16:22 Speaker 3\n",
      "Can we go back now that we changed the wake up word. Do you wanna try using the the new wake up word and setting a reminder appointment? Kind of as a review from what we learned last week too.\n",
      "00:16:42 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Speaker 4, set a time for me to call.\n",

      "Did that work?\n",
      "00:18:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "I don't know. Yeah. It will have to wait until. I found out how to work. I had to do. I had to turn it off everywhere to get the trailer to stop. It.\n",
      "00:18:52 Speaker 3\n",
      "But that was great that you use the wake up word to independently turn it off. So that's really good 'cause I know it can get a lot with the other participants too, with their devices turning on.\n",
      "00:19:04 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:19:06 Speaker 3\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "00:19:19 Speaker 2\n",
      "I’m going to go. Great job on the Despicable Me trailer and remembering to use the wake word to ask your device to pause and play and increase the volume. I'm sure that as we continue to practice, it'll become more natural and you'll get used to using the device some more.\n",
      "00:19:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:19:48 Speaker 2\n",

      "I wanna play some.\n",
      "00:19:56 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:21:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "No.\n",
      "00:21:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Great. Really good job with those commands. Now, can you think of another song that's not sweet Caroline, that you want your device to play for you?\n",
      "00:21:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Speaker 4. Play.\n",

      "00:22:16 Speaker 2\n",
      "That's all right. Really good job with this command. Let's see what else is there. Why don't we try this  number 4 on the road map. So fast forwarding, I don't think you've gone to try that. So why don't we try playing the song once again and then a couple seconds later on we can try this command of fast forwarding?\n",
      "00:22:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Speaker 4, play Sweet Caroline.\n",
      "00:22:52 Speaker 4\n",

      "Speaker 4, Fast forward.\n",
      "00:23:00 Speaker 4\n",
      "I cannot Fast forward this stream. Spring became the summer.\n",
      "00:23:04 Speaker 1\n",
      "Speaker 4, pause. They cannot Fast forward.\n",
      "00:23:12 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, maybe. So I know there's multiple platforms that Speaker 4 can play music from. It might be called. That's one that I'm aware of, or Amazon's own music playing platform, so maybe this function of fast forwarding or going back for the music is only available for certain platforms, so that's OK if we're not able to do that for the song and on your device today.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.

      "- Cognitive decline related to age, impacting the ability to learn and execute technology-based tasks.\n",
      "- Functional limitations due to sensory deficits, e.g., auditory or visual, although these were not explicitly stated during the session.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Discussion:**\n",
      "- The patient's primary issue involves the interface with technology, particularly a voice-activated assistant. Cognitive function might be compromised due to age or fatigue impacting her ability to learn and recall steps in using the device. Therefore, either or both could contribute to her difficulty executing complex tasks without visual or auditory guidance through scaffolding or modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan for Problem 1:**\n",
      "- **Testing/Consultation:**\n",
      "  - No immediate need for medical tests, but consider cognitive assessment if the difficulty persists or impacts other areas of daily functioning.\n",
      "  - Further assessment by an occupational therapist with expertise in assistive technology might be beneficial to tailor the device settings to the patient’s cognitive and sensory needs.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Therapy:**\n",
      "  - Continuation of guided sessions focusing on familiarizing the patient with the device capabilities and limitations. This includes repeated practice to enhance comfort and proficiency with task-specific commands.\n",
      "  - Consider introducing simpler, user-friendly technology or ensure minimal commands are needed to perform essential tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Patient Education and Counseling:**\n",
      "  - Educate about the limitations of the device depending on the subscription services (for example, why some music functions like skipping or changing specific song versions are not accessible).\n",
      "  - Provide printed/written step-by-step instructions for commonly used functions on the device to aid recall.\n",
      "  - Reinforce methods to access help or support for the device, such as instructional websites or customer support services.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Specialist Referral:**\n",
      "  - Referral to assistive technology specialists should there be a continued inability to adapt to the current device, for potentially more adaptive or specialized technology to assist in daily tasks comfortably.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Follow Up:**\n",
      "  - Schedule additional practice sessions to reinforce learned tasks, address any other frustrations, and introduce and practice new commands when the patient feels comfortable.\n",
      "  - Re-evaluate if the adjustments did not improve capability and explore if alternative technology solutions might be more appropriate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the plan centers around integrating practical solutions tailored to the patient's pace and ability, ensuring technology remains a tool for enhancing independence rather than a source of frustration.\n",

      "Great. So currently what type of self-care or health related needs do you have difficulty with managing 'cause I remember a few weeks ago you mentioned that right now you aren't necessarily using anything to remember because you're not having too much difficulty but is there anything else that you might have difficulty with managing?\n",

      "And what are some tools that you currently use to manage your self care and health related needs?\n",
      "00:02:26 Speaker 4\n",
      "I have a medication sheet to manage medication inventories and I use a calendar to write down my appointments, whether it's the dentist or a haircut or doctor or massage.\n",
      "00:02:57 Speaker 3\n",
      "Great. Do you bring that calendar around with you?\n",

      "No.\n",
      "00:03:04 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. It usually stays at home?\n",
      "00:03:08 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yes, I remember mostly and I will say I call you when I have my calendar. I don't use the phone for my calendar and I, they give me cards to go and make the appointment and I bring them home with me and check my calendar and I call them right away and, to reschedule.\n",
      "00:03:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "I see. Great. And then can you think of some scenarios of things that you specifically want to learn? For example, you can say I want to learn how to manage my medications or I want to learn about side effects of this medication, so can you think of some other scenarios of what you would want to learn today?\n",
      "00:04:17 Speaker 4\n",
      "I want to learn how to talk on the phone and make my appointments. The people I say I have aphasia and cannot speak very well and they are impatient and ask me questions I can't answer and I have to, my husband has to get on the phone and interpret.\n",
      "00:04:59 Speaker 3\n",

      "No.\n",
      "00:05:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:05:17 Speaker 4\n",
      "I know everything about Speaker 1. And I asked Speaker 1 to remind me of everything and she does a good job. She reminded me to have the appointment tonight and I said Tuesday. The Echo 5. You don't have to remind me in 30 minutes. Cancel the reminder in 30 minutes. And I saw that it was set up to remind me in 30 minutes.\n",
      "00:06:02 Speaker 3\n",
      "Perfect. Did you see that on the screen? \n",
      "00:06:05 Speaker 4 \n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:06:06 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. That's great.\n",
      "00:06:11 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 4, you mentioned some self-care examples in the main group. When I asked you have certain like self-care things that are relevant to you that you might want Alexa to help with.\n",
      "00:06:30 Speaker 4\n",
      "I don't need any help from Alexa presently. I might need help in the future, so I want the training. I have set up my memory for where they get medications and I have to tell my husband. I have to write down. Perhaps I can use Echo 5 to read my medications and where I get them? And perhaps I don't have to have a paper trail.\n",
      "00:07:34 Speaker 2\n",
      "Great. Speaker 4, do you wanna practice what we did last week? About playing a certain like song or video of choice with Speaker 1.\n",
      "00:07:53 Speaker 4\n",
      "I practice that. I practice that already.\n",
      "00:08:10 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, great. How'd that go?\n",
      "00:08:22 Speaker 4\n",
      "I I. I asked Speaker 1 to play Amazing Grace by some Chris Tomlin, and they went back to play a country music. I don't have an Amazon Music. I don't have that Amazon Music contract. But I have an Amazon.com. I have the Amazon.com and I order many things from Amazon. Will Speaker 1 helped me to order my medications verbally? But I I don't speak very well and I have trouble understanding me and have trouble on the phone understanding me. I have to write out a script to make it clear.\n",
      "00:09:56 Speaker 2\n",
      "So then for like with medication too, do you typically have it on paper, although all like the list of your medications?\n",
      "00:10:06 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:10:10 Speaker 2\n",
      "Do you have like dosage and anything like instructions on it too?\n",
      "00:10:16 Speaker 4\n",
      "No. I'll show you the list. I'm a nurse, so I know the dosages and what they are.\n",
      "00:10:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Great. Yeah. We can definitely practice adding the ones you have right there and create your own personal list. Do you feel like, do you remember, like how much you have to take every time or do you reference the paper?\n",
      "00:10:52 Speaker 4\n",
      "No, I don't reference the paper I have. My note to steel trap. I automatically remember. I change it all the time. So I started with my medications at age 65 and I continued off and on, off and on over the years, adding to the list and subtracting in the list.\n",
      "00:11:35 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 4, did you say earlier that you wanted to use Alexa to order your medication?\n",
      "00:11:44 Speaker 4\n",
      "If that's feasible. But I don't speak very well and the Alexa would have trouble understanding me, understanding me.\n",
      "00:12:02 Speaker 3\n",
      "So I just looked it up. You are able to order items from Alexa if your Amazon account is logged in on the Alexa device. However, there are some items that require you to complete the process of ordering the item through the website itself.\n",
      "00:12:24 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:12:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "So I think it depends on what the item is, so we can try to see. Maybe if it works for the items that you want to try to order. Later on, during the time when we're doing the practice.\n",
      "00:12:43 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK. I order supplements on Amazon already. I have a running list of, I don't know what it's called, previous orders and I access that to see if it's available. I I have to go out to the direct store if it's not available. My eye medications are a good example.\n",
      "00:13:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "And then going back. How you practiced playing music? Did you feel like Alexa had a hard time understanding you? Or were you able to get through the commands?\n",
      "00:13:46 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yes, I was able to get through the commands.\n",
      "00:13:53 Speaker 2\n",
      "Did.\n",
      "00:13:53 Speaker 4\n",
      "I didn’t have to readjust Alexa at your suggestion. It's not too fast for me.\n",
      "00:14:07 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:14:12 Speaker 4\n",
      "I am not a good example to practice on.\n",
      "00:14:18 Speaker 2\n",
      "No, it's good. We're all learning. These are good skills to have. I think other groups are still finishing up the questions. Anything else you would like to share with us regarding like this week's topic, especially or anything that happened this past week while you were doing it yourself?\n",
      "00:14:50 Speaker 4\n",
      "I have to have an Alexa music app or something. I have to have a subscription for to access Alexa on the Echo 5. Is that right?\n",
      "00:15:19 Speaker 2\n",
      "Can you repeat that?\n",
      "00:15:21 Speaker 4\n",
      "I have to have a subscription to access music on Amazon or a streaming service.\n",
      "00:15:36 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes, I think you need to be connected to a streaming service. Do you have even YouTube on your Alexa or no?\n",
      "00:15:51 Speaker 4\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "00:15:55 Speaker 4\n",
      "Speaker 1, access YouTube.\n",
      "00:15:59 Speaker 1\n",
      "Here is YouTube.\n",
      "00:16:00 Speaker 2\n",
      "Oh, OK, then we see. You wanna try saying the command, like play whatever song on YouTube? Maybe specify if you wanna go on YouTube if you will do that.\n",
      "00:16:20 Speaker 4\n",
      "Amazon. YouTube. I have to say Speaker 1 first. Speaker 1, play YouTube and Amazing Grace by Chris Tomlinson. You can review your self privacy settings, OK. Choose the option that writes for here. They have something about self privacy options here.\n",
      "00:17:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Let's go home first. Let's restart.\n",
      "00:17:13 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK. Home.\n",

      "Use the. Make sure you use the wake word.\n",
      "00:17:33 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK. I. Home. Speaker 1, home. Speaker 1 connect to YouTube.\n",
      "00:17:55 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. And then do you wanna tell her a follow up on what song you wanna play on YouTube?\n",

      "Is that the version you're looking for?\n",
      "00:19:09 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yes. I played it earlier on YouTube on my iPad. I like it. You suggested it last week. Chris. How do I turn it off?\n",
      "00:19:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "You can say the wake word and then ask it to stop and then maybe go home after that.\n",
      "00:19:50 Speaker 4\n",

      "YouTube is a great device. I have learned to use it.\n",
      "00:20:34 Speaker 3\n",

      "00:20:40 Speaker 4\n",
      "I use it to watecolor lessons. I use it to explore everything. I want to learn about poetry or my grandson's basketball games.\n",
      "00:21:19 Speaker 3\n",
      "Great. And do you usually use YouTube on your iPad?\n",
      "00:21:25 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yes. I know how to extend it on the TV. I do that all the time. I pull it up on my iPad and put it on the TV. Can I do that with Echo 5?\n",
      "00:21:56 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm not sure if you can display the Echo 5 on to the screen. But I'm glad that that works for you with the iPad.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

It's just one of those other accessibility options to help with like day-to-day like routine or anything, yes.\n",
      "00:15:02 Speaker 2\n",
      "So it's just kind of an artificial intelligence machine.\n",
      "00:15:07 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, and it can help, especially with this training too. We’re working with participants with like different cognitive deficits. So kind of helping with like that memory piece or helping with like knowledge based questions too.\n",
      "00:15:26 Speaker 3\n",
      "They're researching.\n",

      "00:15:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "It can help manage like remembering things 'cause now that even for me like I use like my phone to help like schedule things in or like keep and manage like different appointments. The same thing with Speaker 4 kind of keeping all. It's like a digital planner too, if you can.\n",
      "00:16:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, so it does have a calendar section?\n",
      "00:16:11 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. So you can add different like events on your calendar and it will remind you, it'll pop up on the screen too.\n",
      "00:16:20 Speaker 2\n",
      "And when you say, it'll remind me, will it remind me vocally or only visually?\n",
      "00:16:25 Speaker 1\n",
      "It should, it should do both. Yeah. So like even with that reminder that you set with that medication? \n",
      "00:16:35 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:16:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "It should verbally remind you. If not like let me know and then we could kind of troubleshoot that too. 'Cause, this one too. This training is also kind of troubleshooting kind of play around with the device and kind of get familiar with it to see how we can better like support you and your needs like with your day-to-day routine.\n",
      "00:16:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:16:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, so so Speaker 3, do you have all of your medications in this machine?\n",
      "00:17:02 Speaker 2\n",
      "No. \n",
      "00:17:03 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, but you can add them. You know how to do that?\n",
      "00:17:06 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:17:07 Speaker 2\n",
      "And you can tell them when you want them to tell you to remind you.\n",
      "00:17:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "I have the medication printed out.\n",
      "00:17:15 Speaker 2\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "00:17:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "And I know.\n",
      "00:17:17 Speaker 2\n",
      "I know you know.\n",
      "00:17:18 Speaker 3\n",
      "That it's just an exercise for their future.\n",
      "00:17:24 Speaker 2\n",
      "Right. So I can ask. Speaker 4, who won the 400 meters for men in this year's Olympics.\n",
      "00:17:38 Speaker 4\n",
      "Sorry, I don't know that one.\n",
      "00:17:41 Speaker 2\n",
      "Oh, they don't know.\n",
      "00:17:42 Speaker 1\n",
      "So there's some things that. So it's also really helpful for us to know, you know, what limitations Speaker 4 still has. So this is kind of like what this training to, you know, what avenue and like what extend does Speaker 4 know and like what it doesn't know yet and how.\n",
      "00:18:00 Speaker 2\n",
      "Well, how often do you feed it data?\n",
      "00:18:03 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's a. That's a, that's a question Amazon would know, I think.\n",
      "00:18:14 Speaker 2\n",
      "Let me, if I asked who won the baseball game this afternoon, will it know?\n",

      "Thank you very much, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:18:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "So, OK, yeah, that's, that is really interesting to me too, to see like what Speaker 4 knows already and doesn't. So that data piece, yeah, like you mentioned.\n",
      "00:18:52 Speaker 2\n",
      "They, they don't know the Olympics, but they know the pirates.\n",
      "00:18:54 Speaker 1\n",

      "From Reuters. This is Reuters. Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz campaigned for a second day in the battleground state of Michigan Wednesday with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as her freshly picked running mate. It's been a pretty interesting 24 hours for me I'll have to be honest. The Harris campaign was putting Waltz's Midwestern credentials to the test in parts of the country critical to the election. They rallied together in another swing state, Wisconsin, earlier in the day where the former teacher, a National Guard veteran, took aim at Republican rival Donald Trump. This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the people. And that's to say nothing of the job he did as president. Polls show Harris has raised Trump's lead, built up during the final weeks of Biden's campaign, and re energized Democratic Party, has flooded her campaign with donations in the 24 hours after announcing waltz as the vice presidential pick on Tuesday. They raised $36 million, according to her team. Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. In. That's in a reminder of how divisive the war in Gaza remains for the party, a group of pro Palestinian hecklers briefly interrupted Harris's speech in Michigan.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.

Other benefits that were noted by P1 included searching for information; specifically medical information about tremors, “said to him after we were done the with the training. You have essential tremors. You can ask Ziggy (Speaker 4) what is the central tremors? We have a friend who is has essential tremors and he is not as worse than my husband and I, I, it was comforting to him to have Speaker 4 tell me, tell us that it was not anything to be worried about. I'm sorry.”. When interacting with her device, P1 had mentioned experiencing some difficulty with speech recognition. Not only did it discourage her from using the device more consistently, but it also took a toll on her confidence to speak, “I I have struggled in the years in the months I have signed up for this training and volunteered for the research. I have gone downhill precipitously in my speech and in my health overall and I struggled to bring my whole self here.”. Despite encountering difficulty with speech recognition, P1 was taught other alternatives that made her Speaker 4’s speech recognition more accessible, “Ah. It was straightforward asking. I learned to ask Speaker 4 to. It was straightforward and I learned to minimize my my instructions and not say please and extraneous words.”. P1 referred to learning how to change her wake up word from “Speaker 4” to “Ziggy” because it was more feasible for her to articulate. \n",

L.V.G. expresses that her husband, who also has essential tremors, finds reassurance from the virtual assistant, which helps alleviate their anxiety about the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The onset of forgetfulness prompted her to seek technological help. Although she initially faced challenges with the device's speech recognition capabilities, leading to a decline in confidence in articulating commands, she learned strategies to simplify her interactions, like minimizing unnecessary words, which has eased her usage. Moreover, changing the device's wake-up word to \"Ziggy\" has been helpful in making the device more accessible.\n",

      "L.V.G. reports a decline in speech and overall health over the past few months, which she attributes to increased challenges and frustrations in adapting to these changes. Despite this, she remains proactive in finding solutions by participating in training and research to improve her interactions with Speaker 4.\n",

      "**Problem 1: Essential Tremors**\n",
      "- **Differential Diagnoses**: Essential tremors, as indicated by the patient's personal and family history. Alternative neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) should be considered due to the reported speech difficulties, although these are less likely given the symptom profile and lack of other Parkinsonian features.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Plan**:\n",
      "  - **Testing**: Referral for a neurological evaluation is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of essential tremors and rule out other neurodegenerative disorders. If tremors worsen or additional symptoms such as rigidity develop, consider a dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan) for differential diagnosis of tremor causes.\n",
      "  - **Therapy**: Counsel the patient on lifestyle modifications to manage tremor severity, such as reducing caffeine intake and avoiding stress when possible. Depending on the neurological assessment, medication like propranolol or primidone may be considered to manage tremor symptoms.\n",
      "  - **Patient Education**: Educate the patient and her husband on essential tremors, emphasizing that it is a common and generally benign condition, but reassurance and coping strategies are vital.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem 2: Speech Recognition Difficulties and Confidence Decline**\n",
      "- **Differential Diagnoses**: Speech recognition issues may stem from a decline in cognitive agility, a common occurrence with aging, particularly in the context of essential tremors which may subtly affect oral motor skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Plan**:\n",
      "  - **Testing**: Referral to a speech-language pathologist for a comprehensive assessment of speech and language abilities to identify specific areas of decline and guide individualized therapy.\n",
      "  - **Therapy**: Initiate a speech therapy program focusing on articulation and cognitive-linguistic strategies to enhance communication efficiency and confidence.\n",
      "  - **Patient Education**: Reinforce the importance of utilizing simplified commands with technology and encourage regular practice with the AI assistant for improved acclimatization.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Plan Components**:\n",
      "- **Follow-up**: Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months or sooner if symptoms progress or new issues arise, to reassess the patient's overall health and adaptation to strategies provided.\n",
      "- **Interdisciplinary Consults**: Consider a geriatric or occupational therapist consultation to tailor additional adaptive strategies that may assist the patient in daily living activities, including enhanced interactions with AI technology.\n",
      "- **Emotional Support and Counseling**: Provide resources for mental health support to manage frustration and emotional distress potentially exacerbated by health conditions and technology-related challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Behavioral and Lifestyle Modifications**:\n",
      "- Encourage participation in mindfulness or stress-reduction activities that can help manage anxiety related to tremors and memory concerns.\n",
      "- Discuss the possibility of integrating cognitive games or exercises to support memory and cognitive health, potentially including those available through the AI assistant interface. \n",

Some of these individuals are have experiences with using assistive technology. Some of them have not. My research focuses on using Speaker 7, which you'll probably have heard about. If you haven't, we can explain to you more, but it is a voice interface where you don't have to necessarily look, but it allows you to communicate via voice. So, that's what we're hoping to show you and Speaker 1 how we can have a device for you in the home setting, so you can use it to do things like asking for, like, what are the new movies coming up, or what are the new music albums? Um, sports? I don't know if you follow any sports. Or, reminders and weather. Just things like that where you normally probably previously use to read, but now you can ask and hear back. Speaker 6 and I felt this might be a good support at home, especially when Speaker 1 is not around to answer all the questions. You can try to see if you can get some questions and needs answered by trying Speaker 7. If you have any questions in the middle of this whole testing, which is not to kind of like quiz you. We're trying to learn how well you understand language and information and remembering. So, we'll try to see where you're at, and then what type of things we can provide for you.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

The encounter is part of a research initiative conducted by the University of Southern California. Patient M. incurred a traumatic brain injury on December 13, 2022, resulting from a gunshot wound to the head. Before the incident, he lived in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and previously resided in Fort Riley, Kansas. Prior to the injury, he was engaged in work related to aircraft maintenance, specifically on Blackhawk helicopters in the military, coded as MOS 15 Tango. After his military service, he transitioned to stone masonry and had recently started working at Spirit Aero Systems in aircraft maintenance before the injury occurred. Patient M. expressed no questions about the training and seemed to understand its purpose as using voice commands to obtain information when his caregiver is not present.\n",

      "Then. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n",
      "00:14:20 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something interest that that would entrust him, I will send. It to you.\n",
      "00:14:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "As well, uh, that would be awesome.\n",
      "00:14:28 Speaker 2\n",
      "There with him.\n",
      "00:14:29 Speaker 3\n",
      "For example, a lot of the apps that we that are in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision like luminosity or cognitive like the names are I'm kind of escaping them but. The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad, so. It just it isn't accessible so. Yeah.\n",
      "00:15:09 Speaker 2\n",
      "It it does. Yeah. Yeah. No, but definitely there are, I guess, which require even though there is visual, visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know.\n",
      "00:15:24 Speaker 2\n",
      "So, so yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that you know he he cannot play. So that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions. You know, so that it it kind of stay sharp. Right. Like that's that's something we all need to do but definitely that will that'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time, Speaker 1, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n",
      "00:15:52 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hey Speaker 1, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it. She's right.\n",
      "00:16:00 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n",
      "00:16:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "I don't think she heard you.\n",
      "00:16:09 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n",
      "00:16:14 Speaker 4\n",
      "What's the reminder for?\n",
      "00:16:20 Speaker 1\n",
      "The beach tomorrow.\n",
      "00:16:23 Speaker 4\n",
      "When should I remind you?\n",
      "00:16:25 Speaker 1\n",
      "9:30.\n",
      "00:16:27 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK, I'll create a reminder here at 9:30 tonight.\n",
      "00:16:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "Thank you, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:16:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Did you say for to go for? To go to a beach.\n",
      "00:16:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "00:16:37 Speaker 2\n",
      "Ohh that's amazing. OK.\n",
      "00:16:39 Speaker 3\n",
      "Alright, I said. Where are we going tomorrow? It's to give him an idea. For what? To set it for.\n",
      "00:16:45 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM. It will. It will set it to the closest like so, since it's evening already, it's going to set it to. Uh. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know. Uh, yeah, it will just. Set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n",
      "00:17:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:17:15 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, OK. Alright. OK.\n",
      "00:17:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "All right, so now we can go to the main room and we'll practice some there and then we'll come back into the breakout room.\n",

      "All right, that's perfect, because I think I think you just watched the trailer for Despicable Me 4. So that's why it's giving you like the joke related two minions.\n",
      "00:19:36 Speaker 4\n",
      "Sounds like.\n",
      "00:19:45 Speaker 2\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:19:49 Speaker 2\n",

Is your refrigerator running or Speaker 4, are you blue? You know you can ask the question like that and you can just just for fun and it will have some sarcastic or some funny answer to it. So you want to try, you want to give it a shot.\n",

      "Only my light ring.\n",
      "00:20:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 1, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom. Uh, which sort of means that it heard your voice or it it's the wake up word for it. So uh, it it almost means that it the UM the device is listening. So. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get. It goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are. A lot of questions. It's even online when you just like kind of search that. Ohh what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. Thank you.\n",

Maybe if you have Spotify or Pandora or any anything, or even Amazon Music, it might be able to play more number of songs like.\n",

I you might not like the song, but just so that we can practice this command. So can you say Speaker 4 play sweet Caroline.\n",

      "It is.\n",
      "00:24:47 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:25:27 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, it is.\n",
      "00:25:29 Speaker 3\n",
      "It could be from that particular song, I don't know. Huh. So. Why don't you say volume up, Speaker 1?\n",
      "00:25:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4, volume up.\n",
      "00:25:47 Speaker 3\n",
      "It did the opposite.\n",
      "00:25:50 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. Across.\n",
      "00:25:54 Speaker 3\n",
      "Give it how many times?\n",
      "00:25:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's the volume up by 3.\n",
      "00:26:00 Speaker 4\n",
      "And no so. If I.\n",
      "00:26:12 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 1, volume down two times.\n",
      "00:26:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "Speaker 4, volume down two times.\n",
      "00:26:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:26:22 Speaker 2\n",
      "It did. Ohh perfect. How about we try? To play it from the beginning.\n",
      "00:26:33 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n",
      "00:26:42 Speaker 3\n",
      "No. Try again.\n",
      "00:26:44 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n",
      "00:26:51 Speaker 3\n",
      "Again.\n",
      "00:26:53 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you play this song from the beginning?\n",
      "00:26:57 Speaker 4\n",
      "Starting this song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n",
      "00:27:01 Speaker 2\n",
      "Ohh. There was a lot of restrictions here I guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and go back play from the beginning. All of that also, we are definitely able to do all of that. So yeah.\n",
      "00:27:34 Speaker 3\n",
      "So you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 1 has Apple music. I wonder. That would I should be able to hook the Apple music.\n",
      "00:27:45 Speaker 2\n",
      "To it. Yeah, you should be able to.\n",
      "00:27:47 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:27:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "Definitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And maybe if you had like a playlist made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well you know so our previous songs go back.\n",
      "00:28:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "The one thing I noticed is when Speaker 1 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n",
      "00:28:36 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line once that blue line is on and then you start speaking, it definitely picks up the command better.\n",
      "00:28:56 Speaker 3\n",
      "Right, right.\n",
      "00:28:56 Speaker 2\n",
      "I think if it's in if, if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it doesn't. Usually it's. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 1 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just want to say like maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works where there's like a just a very small pause. It doesn't even.\n",
      "00:29:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:29:42 Speaker 2\n",
      "Have to be. Very long, because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you you're not going to say anything next. So yeah, but more or less you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying.\n",
      "00:29:51 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. And playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you, yeah.\n",
      "00:30:09 Speaker 2\n",
      "But OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Oh. OK. So even even though, Speaker 1, you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But it just has to be just Speaker 4. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has. Uh, yeah.\n",
      "00:31:13 Speaker 3\n",
      "You know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 1 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give. Hmm. A visual description of what's going on in the background of the picture, so it'll describe. The scenes and some TVP's do that. Ours doesn't, but some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature, right? So I'm wondering if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's so I? Yes. But something description, audio description or something like that?\n",
      "00:32:03 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n",
      "00:32:04 Speaker 5\n",
      "Ability.\n",
      "00:32:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Do you understand? I'm trying. Yeah, yeah, it.\n",
      "00:32:19 Speaker 2\n",
      "It's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the picture that's going on on the screen, so.\n",
      "00:32:28 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something. The blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background with the following words.\n",
      "00:32:46 Speaker 2\n",
      "Right, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. If if it has that kind of captioning. Or yeah.\n",
      "00:33:02 Speaker 6\n",
      "You mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n",
      "00:33:03 Speaker 2\n",
      "Ohh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about it.\n",
      "00:33:08 Speaker 6\n",
      "No, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 1, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example, if you decide to like look up pictures. Like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean, it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own clothes captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us as some in that respect.\n",
      "00:34:00 Speaker 3\n",
      "I do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n",
      "00:34:30 Speaker 2\n",
      "It's starting to. OK. OK. Right, right. Yeah. Like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh. But yeah, I mean maybe it they are not providing yet, but hopefully in the future very soon even Alex, I should start providing that hopefully that that will help a lot definitely.\n",
      "00:34:52 Speaker 3\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

      "00:11:55 Speaker 1\n",
      "You had mentioned. Games using Speaker 4 and auditory stimuli. So are you are you thinking of like? You know how I'm app. We have Apple devices, so going through the App Store they have all kinds of games like word pairs for example. That's one that I downloaded onto his iPad so. That. Is there a way to link that up with Speaker 4 or would it be something completely different?\n",
      "00:12:27 Speaker 2\n",
      "So Speaker 4, Amazon has Speaker 4 has some of their own skills, which are games. And which can be like you can you can just activate them with. With that with your voice. So definitely that and then.\n",
      "00:12:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Where might I find a? List of. Of those types of games.\n",
      "00:12:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "So if you would like just go, if you go on Amazon app like the UM, Prime app or anything that you have like the Amazon app. If there is a section for games and it it it has, like all the featured games there, it's all by categories like they have quizzes like song quizzes and it also has things like who wants to be a millionaire like deal or no deal. OK. Things like that, which are very, very familiar. Of course that those are part of the TV. So but there are different other things as well, so. Yeah. So there are definitely.\n",
      "00:13:31 Speaker 1\n",
      "And then I'm sorry. They'd be voice activated. OK.\n",
      "00:13:35 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes, they will be voice activated. Mm-hmm. So I I, I'm sure that there are some that would require you to use, uh, visual as well, but there might. There are definitely number of games I guess he can play with just the voice.\n",
      "00:13:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "Then. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll look into that.\n",
      "00:13:55 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. And if I'm able to find something, UM, interest that, that would entrust him, I will send it to you.\n",
      "00:14:01 Speaker 1\n",
      "As well, uh, that would be.\n",
      "00:14:02 Speaker 2\n",
      "Awesome. We'll share with him.\n",
      "00:14:04 Speaker 1\n",
      "For example, a lot of the apps that we that. Or in the literature for traumatic brain injury, fire vision, like luminosity or cognitive, like the names are. I'm kind of escaping them but.\n",
      "00:14:16 Speaker 6\n",
      "Because.\n",
      "00:14:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "The the typical brain apps because you have to follow a maze or you have to do and it they truly have a visual component and I have reached out to the companies of those apps and they have said that they're not compatible with voice over on the iPad. IPad so. It just it isn't accessible so.\n",
      "00:14:45 Speaker 2\n",
      "It does, yeah, yeah. No, but definitely there are I guess, which require even though there is visualized visual stimuli stimuli coming on the screen, there definitely can be played without it, you know? So. So yeah, even if it requires that doesn't mean that, you know. He he cannot play, so that would be very good for like just, you know, using mental different mental functions, you know, so that it it. Kind of stay sharp, right? Like, that's that's something we all need to do. But definitely that will. That'll be amazing. So with our left leftover time. Speaker 3, how about we set a reminder with your Speaker 4?\n",
      "00:15:28 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey Speaker 3, set a reminder. Let let me unmute it.\n",
      "00:15:35 Speaker 3\n",

      "Right. I don't think she heard you.\n",
      "00:15:44 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you set a reminder for me?\n",
      "00:15:49 Speaker 4\n",

      "9:30.\n",
      "00:16:02 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK, I'll create a reminder at 9:37.\n",
      "00:16:06 Speaker 3\n",
      "Thank you, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:16:08 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:16:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "I said, where are we going tomorrow? It's to give me an idea for what? To set it for.\n",
      "00:16:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, perfect. Alright. Yeah. And so you would definitely notice that if you don't say AM or PM it will it will set it to the closest like so since it's evening already it's going to set it. To. Tomorrow morning, instead of tomorrow night, you know? Yeah, it will just set the reminder for the closest. Time I guess if that makes sense.\n",
      "00:16:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:16:50 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. OK. All right.\n",

      "00:20:04 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Yes. So Speaker 3, because so the the device that you have when when you say Speaker 4 it it has like this blue line that goes across the screen at the bottom which sort of means that. It heard your voice or it. It's the wake up word for it. So uh, it. It almost means that it the UM the device is. Listening so. So that's why it says that only when you know Speaker 4 is listening, that's when it's that that's when it get it goes blue or something. So just so you get the context. But yeah, there are there are. So there are a lot of questions even online when you just like. Kind of search that what? What are the funny questions you can ask Speaker 4 and it just gives like a list of things that you know you can ask and just for fun and some lighthearted enjoyment I guess. So all right. OK. Is there? OK, let's see. What else would you like to listen to some music now? Or how about that? Yeah. OK, perfect. So.\n",

      "00:25:28 Speaker 3\n",
      "Volume up by 3.\n",
      "00:25:31 Speaker 4\n",

      "Speaker 4, volume down to times.\n",
      "00:25:52 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, it did. There you go.\n",
      "00:25:54 Speaker 2\n",
      "Perfect. How about we try? The two play it from the beginning.\n",
      "00:26:05 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4, can you players from the beginning?\n",
      "00:26:14 Speaker 1\n",
      "Try again.\n",
      "00:26:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hey, Alex, can you play this song from the beginning? So. Hey Speaker 4, can you play this song? From the beginning.\n",
      "00:26:29 Speaker 4\n",
      "He's starting his song is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited.\n",
      "00:26:35 Speaker 2\n",
      "There was a lot of restrictions here I. Guess. I believe once you have logged into the service, anything that you you're using it can be any streaming service. I guess it will be much much easier, but it is definitely able to Fast forward and. Go back, play from the beginning. All of that also, we're definitely able to do all of that so. Yeah.\n",
      "00:27:05 Speaker 1\n",
      "So you said that he could hook up Spotify, and I believe Speaker 3 has Apple music. I wonder. Yeah. That when I should be able to hook the Apple music. To.\n",
      "00:27:17 Speaker 2\n",
      "It yeah, you should be able to. OK. Definitely. So hopefully that should that, that should definitely make it much, much easier to to use all the controls whatever songs he wants to play whenever he wants to play. Yeah, absolutely. OK. Alright. And maybe if you had like a. Made and then if a certain playlist is is going on and maybe he you could say next song or something like that as well. You know. So our previous songs go back.\n",
      "00:27:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "The one thing I noticed is when Speaker 3 says her name, if he pauses for a second and then gives the command, it's a she understands it better.\n",
      "00:28:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes, definitely. I guess you, uh, so for uh, for us it's usually easier for us to see for the blue line, one step blue line is on and then you start speaking it definitely picks up the command better. Right. I think if it's in if if there is no pause there after Speaker 4 then it sometimes it it doesn't usually it. It it's uh, you know, it sometimes picks up or it doesn't pick up. It depends on like how what the time frame is between, UM, the between the wake word and the command, the starting of the command. So. So Speaker 3 definitely it's almost like you know how if you're talking and you have to take a pause. Like it's a natural pause. You just wanna say, like, maybe one Mississippi and and then start saying the command. It usually works. Yeah. Where there's, like, a just a very small pause. It doesn't even have to be very long because if it's too long again, it's going to think that, oh, you, you're not going to say anything. Next. So. Yeah, but more or less, you did wonderful. I mean, this is amazing. I I hope that you're enjoying, uh, playing with the device a little bit and there's so much more you can do and that, that, that should definitely help you. Yeah, but OK, so there's one last thing I wanted to show you guys. See. Alright, so even even though Speaker 3 you might not or might not use this, but you can also see photos if you wanted to have like photos on there mom just for even for the family. But. It just has to be just Speaker 4. Uh. Show me my photos and it will show you. The photos that are on your camera roll that is in the Amazon Photos app, or like it can also show you different Wallpapers that they have like just embedded in there. So for now, since there are probably no photos on your Amazon app, so that's why it might not show you. But I just wanted to. Uh. Put this out there. Like you know that this is another function that it has, yeah.\n",
      "00:30:45 Speaker 1\n",
      "You know, for example, if you go to the, I'm not sure what it's called, but when you go to the movies, Speaker 3 can ask at the front desk for a special device and it would. It's like a headphone set that will. Well, and he'll hear the the movie like you and I would, but it will also give a visual description of what's going on in the background of the movie. So it'll describe the scenes and some TV's do that, ours doesn't. But some do. Some smart TV's do do that. It's a special feature. So I dream if I said Speaker 4, show me the photos and I have the photos in the app, did they have that feature that it's I it's something description, audio description or something like that.\n",
      "00:31:20 Speaker 4\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "00:31:35 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, I am not very sure with the photos app if it has, but I'm more than happy to sort of research a little bit and find out.\n",
      "00:31:35 Speaker 1\n",
      "Just.\n",
      "00:31:48 Speaker 2\n",
      "So.\n",
      "00:31:48 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you understand? I'm trying. I'm. I'm.\n",
      "00:31:50 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, it's almost like closed captioning. But yeah, but I I know. I know what you mean. It's almost like the description of the off the sure that's going on on the screen, so. Thanks.\n",
      "00:32:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "For what you have on the screen right now, it would say something like blue picture frame in the inside of the picture frame is a white background. And. With the following word.\n",
      "00:32:18 Speaker 2\n",
      "Right, right. Right. No, I I'm more than happy to research a little bit and get back to you about it. I'm not too sure about this. Uh, if if it has the kind of. Captioning or yeah.\n",
      "00:32:33 Speaker 5\n",
      "You mind if I say something? So since we don't?\n",
      "00:32:35 Speaker 2\n",
      "Ohh yeah, please go ahead if I don't know if you know about.\n",
      "00:32:39 Speaker 5\n",
      "No, I was listening a little bit. I was kind of here to observe, but I was going to suggest I I know Speaker 4 doesn't provide that level of accessibility yet of providing those closed captions for images that it shows. So being there as a support for Speaker 3, maybe describing the pictures that are showing up on the device. So for example if you. Decide to like look up pictures. From like past vacations or old family pictures, you could say oh here is umm so and so at the restaurant or at a specific place, and then that could kind of serve as a description. I mean it is a little hard to kind of, you know kind of create your own closed captions. But at this point. Like, you know, like it the devices haven't really gotten that far yet to provide that kind of accessibility. So just kind of serving us in that respect.\n",
      "00:33:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "I do know that on Facebook, for example Instagram, they are starting to provide that because I joined a a group like an accessible group for people who are blind or visually impaired, and a lot of times like anything from Braille Institute, you'll see written underneath. The visual description and if you were blind, you could click on it. And it would play for you. So I know it's becoming a little bit more mainstream, not a lot, but it's starting to.\n",
      "00:34:02 Speaker 2\n",
      "Starting to. OK. OK. Right. Right. Yeah, like, I mean, I definitely wasn't sure. Uh, But yeah, I mean, maybe if they're not providing yet, but hopefully in the future, very soon, even Alex, I should start providing that. Hopefully that that will help a lot. Yeah.\n",
      "00:34:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "You never know with all the AI so.\n",
      "00:34:26 Speaker 2\n",
      "Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.\n",
      "00:34:29 Speaker 3\n",
      "M.\n",
      "00:34:31 Speaker 2\n",
      "All right. OK. All right. So I guess that's about it. Let me stop sharing. Alright. Is there anything else, Speaker 3 or Mom, do you do you think you need anything else? Any. Any other questions you might have related to entertainment or? Anything related? To today's. Question.\n",
      "00:34:59 Speaker 3\n",
      "No.\n",
      "00:34:59 Speaker 2\n",
      "Or in general with Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:35:03 Speaker 1\n",
      "I don't think yet and we received the device yesterday and we got it set up. We were able to change the address on it and everything. So that worked out well because Speaker 3's Amazon account was set up for Kansas. So I figured out how to switch it back to our house. So it worked out because Speaker 3 was living in Kansas. Prior to, you know.\n",
      "00:35:25 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, OK, sure. All right. Yeah, but definitely try out using a streaming service for music videos and and see how that goes for you. If you have any questions, reach out and we will be more than happy to help you. With any of those.\n",
      "00:35:45 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Yeah, we definitely have that game thing for next week as well.\n",
      "00:35:51 Speaker 2\n",

      "Alright, perfect. There you go. All right. I am. Yeah, I'm all done for. For in on my end. Where do you think? It's OK if we, I guess, go or like, should we join the main main main room or?\n",

So Speaker 3 and Speaker 1, you wanna maybe just like, look at it together and leave us feedback. We had one for last week. I sent it on Wednesday. I know all of you.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

      "00:06:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right. So our goal is like for you to have, would you say that Speaker 4 should help you? Remember these things on a particular schedule? What? What would you say to do with these needs? What do you think?\n",
      "00:07:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "Are you thinking like a checklist, Speaker 2? As to what you have to do every day? In the morning.\n",
      "00:07:13 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "00:07:16 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right. Sounds good. Alright. What kind of technology or tools do you currently use to manage this these needs? Is there anything that you particularly use to? Make reminders right now for these uh activities.\n",
      "00:07:40 Speaker 2\n",
      "My iPhone.\n",
      "00:07:42 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right. So are you. How are you using the iPhone to uh. Make these reminders for yourself.\n",
      "00:07:56 Speaker 3\n",
      "Are you making reminders on the iPhone, or are you relying on your father or me?\n",
      "00:08:00 Speaker 2\n",
      "Making reminders on the iPhone.\n",
      "00:08:04 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:08:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "So OK. And and your parents are reminding a. Little bit too right? OK, alright, makes sense. All right, so now we're going to think of 10 scenarios. To complete like how you would be using Speaker 4 for these kind of needs. OK so it can include medications reminder about medications or like you know reminders about self-care needs like you mentioned before. So let's come up with a few examples. So.\n",
      "00:08:50 Speaker 3\n",
      "If I could interrupt, Speaker 2 does have reminders for medication on his phone. He does have reminders, set reminder, because he takes medication two times a day. So there is a reminder that goes off in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n",
      "00:09:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "Got it. OK. That's right.OK, alright, that's perfect. So the same thing for uh, for the medications again that can be done also on the uh device on your Speaker 4 device, but let's come up with other other types of scenarios for for the same. For example, of what else would you like to do? I want to learn how to manage. Or take care of myself more about. Whatever you want to add to it, so let's make that kind of list. So I want to. Learn to manage. Or take care. Of myself. What would you say? To.\n",
      "00:10:06 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 2, what would you like to manage or learn to take care of yourself? To what?\n",
      "00:10:11 Speaker 2\n",
      "So I can. Make goals.\n",
      "00:10:17 Speaker 3\n",
      "Make goals.\n",
      "00:10:18 Speaker 2\n",
      "And complete them.\n",
      "00:10:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "And complete them.\n",
      "00:10:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, that's perfect. But how about more related to self-care and medical needs? So for example, let me give you an example here. If so, how, what are the specific information or features would you like Speaker 4 to provide regarding say for example your meals? Or, you know, like for, you know, different other activities of daily living, like trimming your nails or brushing your teeth. What kind of things would you like for Speaker 4 to tell you?\n",
      "00:11:00 Speaker 3\n",
      "Would you like her to remind you?\n",
      "00:11:04 Speaker 3\n",
      "To eat breakfast at a certain time of day or. Is that something reasonable?\n",
      "00:11:12 Speaker 2\n",
      "MHM.\n",
      "00:11:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, Speaker 2. Speaker 2, you understand where this going like, thank you. Think about yourself. Care, your health, your routine that you do every day you wake up, you take a shower. You eat breakfast, you get dressed, you shave. That type of stuff. What do you think? You need help remembering to do?\n",
      "00:11:37 Speaker 2\n",
      "Brushing my teeth.\n",
      "00:11:37 Speaker 3\n",
      "Brushing your teeth. OK, that's fair enough.\n",
      "00:11:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "All right, so. Brushing. Yeah. How about? The dosage of the medication or something. I know that your mom or your dad or is you guys are probably giving him the medicine at this time. But is that something that in future you would want him to sort of know that? Ohh, this box is empty and you need to like put more medicines in that you know how the medication boxes or something like that and if you.\n",
      "00:12:13 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 2 has a medication. And he does. And we fill it, but he opens up the correct day and then takes. It's a combination of vitamins and prescription medications for the morning.\n",
      "00:12:27 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yours. OK. So maybe like it could remind it, it would remind him that, you know, if the medication box is empty so that he can remind you guys that ohh it needs to be filled. You know something like that so that it's more less burden on you and his father and that way like you know he. Can remind you.\n",
      "00:12:48 Speaker 3\n",
      "The same right? And that makes like more.\n",
      "00:12:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "You think of that, Speaker 2?\n",
      "00:12:52 Speaker 2\n",
      "That's a good idea.\n",
      "00:12:53 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. OK. So to. The medication box. And you know, you can make that reminder yourself on there. Like when you think that ohh, this box seems like it's gonna be empty. Like you know, you can feel that and uh make that as a reminder. Good. All right. What else? Is there anything else that you would like? Maybe you would like to know the dosage of something or for example, when it comes to? You know, looking for a medication, say, I know that all of that is done by your parents, but say you were running out of something and you need need a particular self-care item, right? Like shampoo, conditioner like, you know, anything of that sort to paste. And, you know, you wanted to know, like, OK, where can I find Tylenol, for example, or something like that? And you know, if you would like. Just an example to get those things. You think that would?\n",
      "00:13:59 Speaker 3\n",
      "Fair I'm trying to. Uh. What about time it in Speaker 2 to when we have to reorder, reorder all of Speaker 2's medications through a map? Yeah.\n",
      "00:14:13 Speaker 4\n",
      "MHM. So what about refilling your medications? A reminder to refill your medications.\n",
      "00:14:20 Speaker 2\n",
      "That'd be good. OK.\n",
      "00:14:21 Speaker 3\n",
      "Because I can tell you the dates from the app when it when we can reorder and you could set that up reminder. M.\n",
      "00:14:31 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:14:31 Speaker 3\n",
      "Would be a a reminder to reorder necessary medications.\n",
      "00:14:35 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. OK. Alright, that's perfect. Alright. I think those are very good and we are almost done with this part and we'll wait to go to the main room and do some commands.\n",
      "00:14:54 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Thank you so much for your help. If you think of. I'm assuming I have to go through the app's Speaker 4 app to figure out the book part of it.\n",
      "00:15:09 Speaker 1\n",
      "Uh huh. Uh, the bar the bar. Books you mean?\n",
      "00:15:12 Speaker 3\n",
      "A barred book is what I'm thinking.\n",
      "00:15:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. I'm thinking about that too, but are these books also available on on the audible or other apps?\n",
      "00:15:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "Oh. The Bard app is a library of millions and millions of books. You name it. They have magazines, they have music, they have newspapers from around the world.\n",
      "00:15:42 Speaker 1\n",
      "You know what I would try though, because you said that you have both the apps on the iPad, like the barred app on the iPad and also Speaker 4 app on the iPad. So what I would do is like open Speaker 4 on the iPad and say that Speaker 4, can you pull up or can I? Can can you open the barred app or like, can you open the book that he's reading? Maybe just to try if that works at all? And if it is understanding if those are two like kind of synched or not. And that would help probably.\n",
      "00:16:19 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. OK, perfect. I'll try that. Thank you.\n",
      "00:16:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, right. All right. And then another thing like while we're waiting, I was going to say that with the with the device. So you know, if you feel the buttons on top, they are sort of embossed here so.\n",
      "00:16:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:16:42 Speaker 1\n",
      "I almost feel that if if Speaker 2's able. To mute and unmute.\n",
      "00:16:46 Speaker 3\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "00:16:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "The device on his own, it would be really good that way, like he has more independence. Yeah, over using the device and that way if anyone's not around, he would still be able to use the device. You think we can bump him like, you know a little bit to sort of feel those buttons.\n",
      "00:16:50 Speaker 3\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "00:17:08 Speaker 1\n",
      "Because there are only like 3 which is one is mute and unmute one is like the minus sign and the plus sign for the volume right?\n",
      "00:17:19 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, and the mutes closest to the left, so the button closest to the left is mute and unmute, so that's all he needs. I don't even I could even put a bump up behind it if we needed to. Yeah.\n",
      "00:17:26 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "00:17:31 Speaker 3\n",
      "Feel like a raised dot that's. They're called bump dot.\n",
      "00:17:35 Speaker 1\n",
      "That would be great.\n",
      "00:17:35 Speaker 3\n",
      "Could behind.\n",
      "00:17:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "That would be great, but I I think like we may want to start doing that. So he's more. And more independent.\n",
      "00:17:44 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, definitely that video that you asked get started playing. I I ended up muting it because it's was kind. They're like financial videos that he had on his phone. \n",
      "00:17:52 Speaker 1\n",
      "Ohh OK Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:17:57 Speaker 3\n",
      "They were. And they were playing. So you can tell Speaker 4 to stop, OK? This one. OK, tell Speaker 4 to stop.\n",
      "00:18:05 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:18:08 Speaker 3\n",
      "Stop.\n",
      "00:18:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Stop.\n",
      "00:18:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "There. Yeah, they were Yahoo videos is what they were.\n",
      "00:18:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:18:16 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 2, give me your finger. I'm going to just put it on this device. Just feel this button closest to the end. That's the mute button. Can you push it down? Perfect. You've muted it. Let go. So when it's time to make a command, you'll have to unmute it. OK? Because when everyone says they're commands, she'll start talking. So we'll try that. Speaker 4. During. During tonight.\n",
      "00:18:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. During during when we are practicing those commands tonight. So that would be great. Yeah.\n",
      "00:18:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "But an Speaker 4 app, while we're waiting. From.\n",
      "00:18:53 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:18:55 Speaker 3\n",
      "Do I just say to open the bar app?\n",
      "00:18:59 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, open the board app. Maybe a good one.\n",
      "00:19:03 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Here's the thing. I can't say that. Ohh, it's because it's muted. The app will be muted too, won't it? I bet. Can you unmute?\n",
      "00:19:25 Speaker 1\n",
      "No, I I don't think so actually. Because it's two different ones. So the iPad app only so on your phone and your iPad, it's only the once the app is like sort of you're in the app, that's when you use it. But I guess like when it comes to. The device. It's like, you know, always kind of right, like listening to you, you know what I mean? So, yeah. Yeah. But it should work. OK.\n",
      "00:19:57 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, open the Bard app.\n",
      "00:20:01 Speaker 4\n",
      "Searching for the.\n",
      "00:20:04 Speaker 3\n",
      "Bard app. It's looking for the Tavern. It miss misunderstood me.\n",
      "00:20:12 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:20:14 Speaker 4\n",
      "Council.\n",
      "00:20:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "Is there is there any particular book that he is listening to? And then maybe we could say that open, such and such the name of the book on the Bard app or something.\n",
      "00:20:30 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, I'll have to open it to see. OK. Here's one that's open, Speaker 2, the legend of the Oyster. Is that right? OK. Hey, Speaker 4. Open. The legend of the cloister.\n",
      "00:21:05 Speaker 4\n",
      "I'm not sure, not sure.\n",
      "00:21:08 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. And the Speaker 4 open, the barred app?\n",
      "00:21:18 Speaker 4\n",
      "Searching for the Tavern? Absolutely.\n",
      "00:21:19 Speaker 3\n",
      "It's not understanding the bars.\n",
      "00:21:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's not on offense. Maybe those two are not synched, so I guess that's the problem.\n",
      "00:21:26 Speaker 3\n",
      "Maybe yeah.\n",
      "00:21:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "Another another option, I can only think of is maybe because the app is on the I. Had and because we have Siri on the on the iPad, of course, right. So I wonder if theory would be able to pick that up because since we have like two different voice assisted technologies, we can try on there if that's something that's important to him like you know make that. That might make him more, you know, independent to use on. Listen to the books whenever he wants.\n",
      "00:21:59 Speaker 4\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "00:22:02 Speaker 1\n",
      "To.\n",
      "00:22:04 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Yeah. While we're waiting, Speaker 2, do you want to try? Ask Surrey to open the file. OK, go.\n",
      "00:22:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. Hey Siri. Can you open the word app?\n",
      "00:22:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "Nope, she. And get it try again mobile. Try that. Ohh not on your phone on this one. Just turn your phone upside down. There you go.\n",
      "00:22:37 Speaker 2\n",
      "Is Siri. Can you open the Bard app?\n",
      "00:22:46 Speaker 3\n",
      "No, it's it must be relying, it's not opening.\n",
      "00:22:50 Speaker 1\n",
      "It's not opening, so maybe it is something. It would be a great idea to sort of e-mail them and see that if there is any way that it could be done. Yeah. Because.\n",
      "00:22:59 Speaker 3\n",
      "No.\n",
      "00:23:00 Speaker 1\n",
      "It's so important, right? Like for him to be. When you're not around, and if he wants to listen to those books like, what's he gonna do, right? Like, so that would be amazing to have that kind of voice control.\n",
      "00:23:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'll send the e-mail to the Braille Institute and ask. Yeah, they're very helpful. So I can send an e-mail to see if there's a way and there could be a certain link that you need to have or whatnot.\n",
      "00:23:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, or some accessibility settings that need to be made on their app settings to make sure that it's synced in some. Something like that. Maybe if it's a simple fix like that it would be amazing to.\n",
      "00:23:44 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. OK, we'll check that out, Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:23:48 Speaker 4\n",
      "My.\n",
      "00:23:52 Speaker 1\n",
      "Alright, so Speaker 2, I think overall with self-care and medical needs sort of your like your goal with that would be to make reminders about day-to-day self-care needs. To become more independent. Would that be sort of an overarching goal?\n",
      "00:24:20 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "00:24:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Alright, perfect. Alright. Alright, so did you all get the? Message.\n",
      "00:24:46 Speaker 3\n",
      "The breakout room.\n",
      "00:24:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:24:48 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. We did thank you for your help. We truly appreciate it.\n",
      "00:24:51 Speaker 1\n",
      "Absolutely. All right. I'll see you there.\n",
      "00:24:54 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n",
      "00:24:55 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:25:10 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, what's up?\n",
      "00:25:12 Speaker 1\n",
      "Alright, alright, let's practice some commands for this week. I'm going to share my screen. All right. So first of all do do we, let's do the let's do deleting. The oranges from the medication list. Speaker 2, do you want to try that? So you're going to say the wake word and say delete oranges from my medication list.\n",
      "00:25:50 Speaker 3\n",
      "Unmute. You have to push it a little harder, Speaker 2. Hold it for like 3 seconds. Maybe we could. There and you heard it. Beep right. Sorry we were unmuting.\n",
      "00:26:07 Speaker 2\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "00:26:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, go ahead, Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:26:12 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4. Could.\n",
      "00:26:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so you're saying the wake word and you're saying delete oranges from my medication list?\n",
      "00:26:28 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Thank you.\n",
      "00:26:30 Speaker 3\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "00:26:31 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4. Can you delete oranges from my medication list?\n",
      "00:26:44 Speaker 4\n",
      "I've checked off oranges from medication.\n",
      "00:26:47 Speaker 2\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:26:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "Ohh did it say check off?\n",
      "00:26:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "And. She said she checked it off, but it's now no longer visible.\n",
      "00:26:55 Speaker 1\n",
      "No longer there. OK, OK. Alright. So I think you made one. Let's add a reminder to take a medication. Is there any particular medication that you need to take at a certain time that you can think of and then we can make a command out of it? So. Do you remember any particular medication name that you usually take?\n",
      "00:27:25 Speaker 2\n",
      "Ibuprofen.\n",
      "00:27:27 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, well you have been.\n",
      "00:27:28 Speaker 3\n",
      "What's the medication you take normally mind. Every day. That's one of your meds. What do you take procedures?\n",
      "00:27:38 Speaker 2\n",
      "Typical.\n",
      "00:27:39 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, so when do you need to take deppa coat?\n",
      "00:27:42 Speaker 2\n",
      "Every day.\n",
      "00:27:43 Speaker 3\n",
      "At what time? In the morning it's at.\n",
      "00:27:53 Speaker 2\n",
      "7:30.\n",
      "00:27:55 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. And in the evening? 8 perfect.\n",
      "00:28:00 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so let's do this. Let's first make the reminder for one time, and then the other so that it's like not a very long command maybe.\n",
      "00:28:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Did you hear that? So do your morning medicine first.\n",
      "00:28:14 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Alright, let's say. Is it at 7:00 AM in the morning? Yep, 7:30.\n",
      "00:28:22 Speaker 3\n",
      "10.\n",
      "00:28:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "7:30 in the morning. OK. So, Speaker 2, you're gonna say the wake word and say remind me to take Deppa coat at 7:30 AM.\n",

      "OK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 7:30 AM.\n",
      "00:28:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. And so the same thing, if you would say, every day after the time then it will it it'll be a recurring reminder for every, every day at 7:30 AM. OK, OK. All right. OK. Do you want to add anything else? Do you want to add the depakote at night?\n",
      "00:29:09 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:29:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, let's do that command.\n",
      "00:29:15 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you remind me to take the depakote at 8:00? Tonight or tomorrow too.\n",
      "00:29:31 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK, I'll create a reminder for tomorrow at 8:00 PM.\n",
      "00:29:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right. OK, perfect. Let's move on. All right. So the next section is if you need to find or the counter medications. So for example Tylenol or ibuprofen like you said, and if you wanted to get some medical. Missions. Where would you be able to find them or neosporin like you were saying? All the over the counter medications. So what? We're going to practice is the wake word. And where do I find Tylenol or where do I find? Ibuprofen. You want to practice that one, Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:30:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4. Where do I find Tylenol?\n",

      "00:30:51 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so it asks follow up questions. If you need to call a particular pharmacy for something, then you can you can. Also do that. All right.\n",
      "00:31:04 Speaker 3\n",
      "If that makes sense.\n",
      "00:31:07 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right. All right. The next one is if you are needing to get some laundry done, if you want to ask some specific questions regarding laundry. All right, so first, let's learn steps to do laundry. I know right now you're not doing these tasks on your own, but just in case, in the future, once you are more comfortable and you're, you know, learning more things to do on your own. If this can be of some help it would. It would make sense at that point.\n",
      "00:31:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "Just so you're aware, at 19, Speaker 2 bought his own house, and so he was doing his own. He was in Kansas, so he was doing his own laundry and his own meal prep everything he had to. He was living in Kansas in his own house.\n",
      "00:32:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "Right, right. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.\n",
      "00:32:08 Speaker 3\n",

      "00:32:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it would be so great to, you know, get more independent. Right, Speaker 2, so. We'll practice practice these commands for now, and then you know anytime you need them, you at least know how to use your device to get some instructions. If you need some. OK. All right. So first learning the steps to do laundry, so we're going to say the wake word and say, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry?\n",
      "00:32:45 Speaker 3\n",

      "00:33:30 Speaker 3\n",
      "It's all visual. How do I do laundry according to wikiHow? And then it describes how to do it.\n",
      "00:33:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, OK. Maybe how about this? Can we try the wake word and say? Give me. UM, the steps to do my laundry. One step at a time, maybe. I wonder.\n",
      "00:33:59 Speaker 2\n",

I guess for you. Say you were running out of all the clean clothes and you want to tell Mom that ohh you need like you know you need help to do laundry. So maybe that that would be more functional for you, Speaker 2. So you're going to say the wake word and say remind me to do my laundry. Not. Uh tomorrow night or, you know, tomorrow night at 5:00 PM or something like that. You want to try?\n",

      "00:37:19 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, see if she'll do that one for you.\n",
      "00:37:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "Speaker 2. Yeah. So for getting stains out of the clothes, you're gonna say the wake word and ask what do I use to get a stain out of the fabric or clothes?\n",
      "00:37:38 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:37:44 Speaker 3\n",

      "That's at least better, I think. At least it's reading out loud, and it's not so long. Uh and I, I sort of get it. I think the the things complex tasks which have different steps like it's multi multi step tasks, those are the ones that are kind of not read out completely and they're giving like full.\n",
      "00:38:18 Speaker 3\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "No.\n",
      "00:39:08 Speaker 4\n",
      "Here's something I found on wikiHow if you need to do laundry, separate your clothing according to the type of fabric, then buy color once you've gathered enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load for the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or a hot water cycle for very dirty clothes. When the clothes are finished washing, move them to the dryer and choose the lowest heat setting possible. Clean the lint trap in your dryer before you turn it on and add a dryer sheet to make your clothes softer and static free.\n",

It reads the whole thing, and once one one time I think it would be so much more helpful if it would do one step at a time and then say that, hey, Are you ready for the next step? Or. Something. Or did you do? That because if someone's doing. Following it step by step, it just makes more sense, you know. So all right, but at least it read the directions rather than just showing text, so that's, uh, at least some some sort of progress we meet there. OK. Yes. All right.\n",
      "00:40:20 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah.\n",

      "Do you want to do this? Next one, Speaker 2, when to use a fabric softener? So if you have a question like that, that if some clothes can be washed and need a fabric softener or not. So you're going to say the wake word and ask when do I use a fabric softener?\n",

      "Yeah. Ohh and press cancel.\n",
      "00:43:14 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right, that's so weird. I mean, it should give at least some remedies or I don't know, or a medication that you can take or call a doctor or something like that, but.\n",
      "00:43:26 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:43:27 Speaker 1\n",
      "Uh. All right, here's one last one, I think so. We're trying to find a specific healthcare provider. So say you have you want to find a specialist. Of some kind. Is there any particular specialist you would like to try? Like a specialty specialist doctor? If you want to find it within your area or within your, you know radius of whatever 25 miles or something. That's what they give you. Usually you would say the vague word and say find me an orthopedic doctor or find me a physical therapy doctor.\n",
      "00:44:09 Speaker 3\n",
      "What kind of doctor Speaker 2? Physical therapy. OK, so say that.\n",

      "00:44:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. All right. So I think when it shows like multiple options on the screen, you can say pick the first one or pick the second one or pick the third one or something. Usually it doesn't show more than three options on the screen, so you can always do that. Speaker 2 like right after. Because it's it's still on the screen and you've heard the information, but say you wanna pick one of them and then it will. You can say, hey, pick the first one, Speaker 4, pick the first one first option. OK.\n",
      "00:45:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, that's.\n",
      "00:45:21 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:45:24 Speaker 1\n",

      "No.\n",
      "00:45:38 Speaker 1\n",

      "Mom, I'm curious. You know how they were making the medication list? Is it possible to send that to a printer?\n",
      "00:45:51 Speaker 4\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "00:45:53 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm just it just kind of, I thought. Of it when?\n",
      "00:45:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. I would say if the printer is in the system of like I, I guess it it will have to be. Synced as well. OK, with the printer and then maybe it might be able to follow that, but again I it's a wireless printer, but I don't know if this can print. I I wonder if you can send. The medication list. It. Through e-mail or like e-mail yourself or something and then. Maybe print it? Then it's easier, right? Because the e-mail can be accessed on your laptop or your computer, and then maybe print it out. That might be an easier option to navigate, I guess.\n",
      "00:46:46 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:46:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:46:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "You know, because remember, we were talking about like, the list of things you do every day. So if you have them listed like a medication list, yeah, if you.\n",
      "00:46:55 Speaker 2\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "00:47:01 Speaker 3\n",
      "Do you know what I'm trying to say? Like if you could send it that list somewhere, or I guess she could just read you the list.\n",
      "00:47:08 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, I mean it. I unless you want to really print it and put it somewhere on, you know, your fridge or something for yourself. To sort. Right then it makes sense to probably print it, but reading the medication list that that she. Would do and that way Speaker 2 can ask this, ask that question and sort of get the information as well without any of us having to and like and if you have having to intervene sort of you know and do it independently.\n",
      "00:47:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "So I guess it could be like reading read my morning routine. If you had a list set up like that. Yeah, make it on your team list. Remember how we talked earlier and then just read that morning routine list, and then you'd have to say, oh, yeah, I did that. Did that. Oh, I. Forgot. That and you can keep having read it to.\n",
      "00:47:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:47:58 Speaker 4\n",
      "You.\n",
      "00:47:59 Speaker 4\n",
      "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n",
      "00:48:01 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, I would check. You know, you can also say like which ones are, uh, which medications have already been taken and those would be checked off. And then the the rest would be the remaining ones and that way he can remember and. But that's a great. I think that's a great command to do every day.\n",
      "00:48:01 Speaker 3\n",
      "And it was.\n",
      "00:48:20 Speaker 1\n",
      "Because once he has a. List for every day because how we said that remind me to take Deppa coat at 8:00 PM and if he says every day it will remind him every single day. Right? And that way. And then it's taken, you know, you know that it's it's been done for that day and then you move on to the next medication something of that sort.\n",
      "00:48:33 Speaker 3\n",
      "Right. So. How's her? Ohh hey. So. And so I took my deppa coat. Or take up a coat off. It'll only take it off for today.\n",
      "00:48:55 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes. And just to make sure, you can say that once, once the once the command is for every day, once we give a command like OK, remind me to take that code at 7:30 AM every day and then the day off like once he's taken it and if he wants to check it off, I think you can say he can say that Speaker 4. UM. I took my depakote today. Or Chekov my deck, depakote, for today. Morning. Yeah, but since it's twice a day, I would say that adding the part about I took it this morning versus I took it this evening would make a difference because you don't want it to take it off the medication list for that night. Right. So the night. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, Speaker 2, one thing I want to point out is when you are talking especially with complex, complex names of medications, you might want to like over articulate, it's almost like you're you're talking with more like you're. Making like over articulated movements of your mouth, like sort of so that it kind of gets it so. It's easier for Alex. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like just going a little bit slower and try to be.\n",
      "00:50:15 Speaker 2\n",
      "MHM.\n",
      "00:50:16 Speaker 1\n",
      "Error. Uh. With more complex names. It's picking up everything wonderfully. Everything that you're talking, but maybe like more complex names might be. It might be a good idea to do that.\n",
      "00:50:28 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. OK, like Tyler now.\n",
      "00:50:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:50:33 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:50:35 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. All right. OK, I will. Is there anything else I can help you with or we can see you in the main room?\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

Alright Speaker 2, how have you been feeling with doing both your like you know muting and unmuting the device without Speaker 1s help. Tell me about that.\n",
      "00:17:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "Good.\n",

      "00:18:42 Speaker 3\n",
      "Perfect. OK. So, but Speaker 2, we definitely for you to use the device more and more. I guess it would make more sense that you keep doing it on a you know more regular basis so that you get more independent with using the device without even Speaker 1 or Speaker 7being around you. You know, so the information seeking would be so much better when it when you're able to do it without Speaker 1s or dad's help. Yeah.\n",

      "OK.\n",
      "00:19:14 Speaker 3\n",

We'll make sure that you do the practicing for muting and unmuting with our Speaker 1's help, and for the next whole week too. Can you do that whenever you have Speaker 4?

It was a Titanic or Stonehenge. It was something like that. It was a history thing. What? When did this? Happen or in what year or whatnot?

      "Of those things, Speaker 2, I think that's what you mean when it says, like, you know, double check the standards. Like so sort of like, you know, you were making sure that you what you were thinking. Or what you know from the past, the information that you know from the past is right or not correct. You think that's that's what you mean. OK, alright. So I would say like my goal is to double check on facts related to. General knowledge information I would say and history. Do you think that's fair?\n",
      "00:23:02 Speaker 1\n",
      "There, Speaker 2, I think that makes good sense.\n",

      "Yeah, gender, knowledge and history. And also like maybe check temperatures that which you do every single day. Right? Like which you're doing anyway. But that's sort of is helping. You, you know, check that kind of information without having Speaker 1 and Speaker 7involved because you know you can. You can ask a question and, you know, verbally it's gonna respond verbally too. So it sort of makes sense.\n",

What's interesting now in, you know, California or what's interesting now? Related to sports or like Olympics, because Olympics is going on, it's such a big event. So you know you would probably get like an entire thing about like what happened, say today what, what kind of games were played or what sort of athlete athletes like one.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

      "Yeah, it's funny. Like, you know, our generation is supposed to be good with computers or something is like, well, fun. Do I press that one? No.\n",
      "00:06:02 Speaker 8\n",
      "I know, I know, something goes wrong. I can't really can't really fix it from there. So this is again like I mentioned our last content week, we're going to be doing meal preparation, OK. So I think Speaker 4 is really great because it can give us a lot of different informations that we need for meal preparations and different types of recipes. I think this makes cooking a lot more convenient and just accessible for everyone, which I think is really awesome. Now when it comes to making a meal, there are a lot of just a couple of different components to remember. Speaker 6 was actually mentioning in the breakout of that cooking is like a chemical reaction, and it’s such a perfect way to describe it. So I think making a meal. Different components that you know, we oftentimes have to include are things like ingredients, a step by step, so directions on how to make the the recipe the dish. How long it's going to take to prepare the meal and just the basic nutritional facts that come with the the dish itself.\n",
      "00:07:21 Speaker 6\n",
      "Yeah. You know, cooking in the kitchen is biochemistry. You have your, you have your product, the final product, and then you have the ingredients to make it, and it's like chemical reaction and then the heat reaction in the oven makes it go.\n",
      "00:07:36 Speaker 8\n",
      "I completely agree. The perfectly balanced equation it is. So sometimes we we struggle to cook for, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Or maybe we have, like, addition our mind that we need a simple recipe for to try at home. I know this happens to me quite a bit, especially when I'm scrolling through social media and I find different recipes that I wanna make. But I think what's great that is that Speaker 4 can actually help us find a lot of these recipes and even cater to a lot of our like dietary needs, which we're kind of gonna dive into a little bit more in our individual breakout rooms, but I think it's just so great that we have, we have such accessibility with with the device. So let's start cooking. So let's look at our first command. We will be asking the device to find us a recipe for any dish we want. So I'm going to show you guys a quick rundown of what you will be seeing on your screen and when what you will be hearing when making these different commands, UM, but first I think let's all put our devices on mute because I think we're just going to be using my UM, my device for the commands that we're all going to be going over, I think it'll just be a little bit easier to to do all of our commands on here. OK, so who wants to go first and ask Speaker 11 for a recipe?\n",
      "00:09:18 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "00:09:19 Speaker 8\n",
      "Right, yes, sure, Speaker 2. Go ahead. Well, let me.\n",
      "00:09:23 Speaker 6\n",
      "Using unmute don't hit hers.\n",
      "00:09:28 Speaker 2\n",
      "Can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n",
      "00:09:39 Speaker 8\n",
      "Sorry, I didn't think it it. I didn't think my my device caught that.\n",
      "00:09:44 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey Speaker 11, can you show me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n",
      "00:09:49 Speaker 11\n",
      "Finding some Mac and cheese recipes for Mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n",
      "00:09:56 Speaker 8\n",
      "Awesome. So we're going to find multiple multiple different options on the screen. And so we're just going to go ahead and say which option. Let me actually. Unblur my background, so we're going to go ahead and pick which option we want. So just for time wise, I'm just going to say Speaker 11, pick option one.\n",
      "00:10:29 Speaker 11\n",
      "Five cheese Mac and cheese from 50 was 4.7 stars with over 2400 ratings. You can ask me for ingredients or say start recipe and I'll walk you through the recipe step by step.\n",
      "00:10:41 Speaker 8\n",
      "All right, so I don't know if you. Guys heard but. It gave a quick verbal description of the recipe itself, so if we don't like, you know, this recipe, we can always say go back and pick another recipe that we would like to try. But let's just say. You know, we're happy with this option, so let's stick with this Mac and cheese recipe. Alrighty. So we're going to move on and ask for directions on how to cook this recipe. Speaker 6, do you want to go ahead and try this command?\n",
      "00:11:21 Speaker 6\n",
      "OK, Speaker 11, what are the distract distractions. Speaker 11, what are they dress? Is that wrong?\n",
      "00:11:37 Speaker 8\n",
      "Sorry about that. You can also use instructions. That's also another alternative word, so feel free to use interchangeably whichever one you prefer. OK.\n",
      "00:11:57 Speaker 6\n",
      "Speaker 11, what are the directions?\n",
      "00:12:02 Speaker 11\n",
      "OK, I'll read the directions one step at a time. At anytime you can ask me to move to the next step. Step one Preheat oven to 350 F 180 C If at any time you need the quantity of an ingredient mentioned in the recipe, just ask me how much you need.\n",
      "00:12:24 Speaker 8\n",
      "Perfect. OK, so who wants to go ahead and try asking the device to go on to the next step and to repeat the step? Speaker 2, do you want to go ahead and try asking to go to the next step and then try asking to repeat the step?\n",
      "00:12:57 Speaker 3\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "00:12:58 Speaker 8\n",
      "The second, the second command.\n",
      "00:13:02 Speaker 1\n",
      "That command says, you know who next step, or you know who repeats that? OK, go ahead.\n",
      "00:13:13 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 11, can you go to the next step?\n",
      "00:13:18 Speaker 11\n",
      "Step 2IN large pot or Dutch oven cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n",
      "00:13:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "But pretend you didn't hear what she said. So what are you going to ask her to do?\n",
      "00:13:33 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n",
      "00:13:43 Speaker 8\n",
      "She never heard that.\n",
      "00:13:44 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 11, repeat.\n",
      "00:13:48 Speaker 8\n",
      "Sorry, I think that was my fault.\n",
      "00:13:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "It wasn't.\n",
      "00:13:58 Speaker 8\n",
      "Go ahead and ask it again.\n",
      "00:14:00 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n",
      "00:14:04 Speaker 8\n",
      "I think it's my Internet because you keep cutting off when you say the word. So sorry about that.\n",
      "00:14:11 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 11, can you repeat?\n",
      "00:14:19 Speaker 8\n",
      "This is another one of the instances where technology, you know, sometimes acts up.\n",
      "00:14:27 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 11 repeat step.\n",
      "00:14:31 Speaker 11\n",
      "Step 2 in a large pot or Dutch oven, cook macaroni according to package directions. Salting the water with two teaspoons of salt. Drain and return to the warm pot.\n",
      "00:14:43 Speaker 8\n",
      "All right, awesome. It wasn't your fault, Speaker 2. My my Wi-Fi was being spotty, so wasn't catching. You say the the wake up word. Alrighty, so now that we have already asked for the directions, or at least the 1st 2 directions, we opened up a specific page and now we can ask for the ingredients which Speaker 4? Which the device? Can can read off of. So Speaker 6, if you want to go ahead and say the last command which is asking for the ingredients.\n",
      "00:15:23 Speaker 6\n",
      "Speaker 11, what are the ingredients?\n",
      "00:15:29 Speaker 11\n",
      "To make this recipe, we need one box of elbow macaroni, 112 ounce can evaporated milk, three eggs, half cup unsalted butter, two cups cheddar cheese, shredded and divided 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons feta cheese crumble, 1 cup Provo. Brown cheese cut into small pieces, half cup smoked gouda cheese, shredded 4 teaspoon salt divided and two teaspoons black pepper.\n",
      "00:15:59 Speaker 8\n",
      "That’s awesome. Those were, those were a lot of a lot of ingredients for just the mac and cheese.\n",
      "00:16:09 Speaker 6\n",
      "Yeah, that's always a good dish. Like, even though in back of mine, it's like cheese noodle. That is good.\n",
      "00:16:17 Speaker 8\n",
      "Yes, I completely, yeah, completely agree. And even with the ingredients, you can always ask to repeat the ingredients, stop, go back. So the commands that we basically learned in Week 1 can always kind of be translated over to all these other weeks. So. I think now would be a good time to move on into our breakout rooms where we can practice all these commands and more, including how to make the shopping list, finding recipes that meet our dietary preferences or restrictions, and I think this is a great opportunity just to have fun. Try out you know different commands. Explore various ways that Speaker 11 can help us with meal preparation and just find, UM, different and fun recipes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n",
      "00:17:18 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:17:20 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 3.\n",
      "00:17:23 Speaker 3\n",
      "All right. OK. So with the finding of recipes, I think we have one problem there where it's really hard for us to get it just to read the ingredients or or the recipes, the options that it's sending. So let's see if we can try to do something about it. OK, let me share my screen with you, and kind of just try. All right. So Speaker 2, let's go back to the Mac, Mac and cheese recipe where you're trying to find the different options. So you wanna say instead of find me a recipe for Mac and cheese, try to say, find and read me the rest recipe options for mac and cheese.\n",
      "00:18:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "Unmute. Right. It's right there.\n",
      "00:18:42 Speaker 2\n",
      "Thanks, Speaker 1. Hey, Speaker 4. Can you find and read me the? Options for Mac and cheese.\n",
      "00:18:49 Speaker 2\n",
      "He didn't hear you try again.\n",
      "00:18:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you find and read me the options for Mac and cheese?\n",
      "00:19:01 Speaker 4\n",
      "There are several options for making macaroni and cheese, including Cheddar, Gouda, Fontina, and brine. These cheeses provide a creamy texture and delicious flavor, making them popular choices for the dish. Additionally, some people prefer to use butter and cream to create an even richer sauce, while others offer a bread. And topping for added crunch and flavor, the possibilities for macaroni and cheese are endless, and it can be a delicious and versatile dish.\n",
      "00:19:27 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, Speaker 2 this time, OK, so it's definitely giving you like different options of cheeses that you can use, but try to say find and read me the recipe options for Mac and cheese and see if it gives you reads you the different options on the screen.\n",
      "00:19:48 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Hey, Speaker 4, can you find and read me the different options for mac and cheese?\n",
      "00:20:01 Speaker 4\n",
      "There are many different options for macaroni and cheese, including different kinds of cheeses and cheese combined.\n",
      "00:20:05 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hmm, so I think it's the same thing again. You're Speaker 2. You're missing the word recipe from the command. So what you want to say is find and read me the option recipe options for mac and cheese.\n",
      "00:20:26 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4 and read me the recipe options for mac and cheese.\n",
      "00:20:33 Speaker 4\n",
      "Finding some mac and cheese recipes OK for mac and cheese, here's a few recipes.\n",
      "00:20:41 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "00:20:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "They're all on the.\n",
      "00:20:43 Speaker 3\n",
      "They're all on on the screen, OK. Yeah, that's unfortunate with the screen I feel. I wonder if we just had the dot like the echo dot or something like that kind of device, it would have to definitely read all the options and that would be so much better for for. Like Speaker 2 right like because at least when he's relaying that information to Speaker 12, he would at least know what he's talking about. So. You know, that would definitely make more sense. Yeah, unfortunately we I don't have that the Echo dot or any of that option.\n",
      "00:21:25 Speaker 5\n",
      "So I was sorry to interrupt. I actually have an echo dot right with me, right? Yeah, very good.\n",
      "00:21:28 Speaker 3\n",
      "You do? OK. Yeah. Can you try it?\n",
      "00:21:33 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah, we can try. Hold on. Let me unmute it. Maybe, Speaker 2, if you want to try it again, I have my echo dot with me.\n",
      "00:21:41 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey echo dot.\n",
      "00:21:43 Speaker 3\n",
      "So you're you're, uh. Oh, Speaker 2, you're still saying uh, Speaker 4, OK, you're not saying the, uh, another word for it, but you're gonna say, find me a recipe for Mac and cheese. Can you?\n",
      "00:21:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, can you find me a recipe for Mac and cheese?\n",
      "00:22:04 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK, for Mac and cheese I recommend 5 cheese Mac and cheese and tasty. What would you? Like. Start recipe, save recipe, send to foam, add to list or hear next recipe.\n",
      "00:22:17 Speaker 3\n",
      "That's perfect. Yeah. In fact, so I think it's only giving one option, but that's still you know, something where at least he can follow through with it instead of, you know, having to use the screen, which is not possible if he wants to do it independently. So that makes sense.\n",
      "00:22:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "I looked in settings and I couldn't see anything that would help us in that regard.\n",
      "00:22:45 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:22:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Maybe if we Google it, we might find some.\n",
      "00:22:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "I think so. I I'm I'm going to try doing that and and see if I can find a setting where it would definitely read everything instead of just giving options on the screen, but let me research a little bit and get back to you on that.\n",
      "00:23:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "00:23:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely. Alright, Speaker 2, we're gonna do another important thing that you would definitely want to do so making a shopping list. OK. So first, you're gonna say, add to shopping list. So add an item to shopping list. OK so any do you think you need something that you want to add to your shopping list?\n",
      "00:23:35 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:23:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. What is it?\n",
      "00:23:38 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey, Speaker 4, Add shampoo to my shopping list.\n",
      "00:23:44 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:23:45 Speaker 1\n",
      "She didn't hear you.\n",
      "00:23:47 Speaker 2\n",
      "Hey Speaker 4, add shampoo to my shopping list.\n",
      "00:23:54 Speaker 4\n",
      "I've added shampoo to your shopping list.\n",
      "00:23:56 Speaker 2\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:23:58 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Then you can say view shopping list, but since that's something that you don't want to do, you can say read me my shopping list.\n",
      "00:24:13 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Hey, Speaker 4, reading my shopping list.\n",
      "00:24:18 Speaker 4\n",
      "You have two items on your shopping list.\n",
      "00:24:22 Speaker 3\n",
      "Where are they?\n",
      "00:24:22 Speaker 4\n",
      "Shampoo. Bananas.\n",
      "00:24:29 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Yeah. All right. And then you, once you're done shopping for those things, you want to say, clear the shopping list.\n",
      "00:24:41 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Hey, Speaker 4, clear my shopping list please.\n",
      "00:24:52 Speaker 4\n",
      "You'd like to remove all items from the shopping list, right?\n",
      "00:24:55 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes, please. Yes please.\n",
      "00:24:59 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK. Yeah.\n",
      "00:25:01 Speaker 2\n",
      "Thanks. Yeah, she said done.\n",
      "00:25:05 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, perfect. Alright.\n",
      "00:25:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:25:09 Speaker 3\n",
      "Let's move on. So I also wanted to add here when you are, uh, listen, maybe once you are done, if you're doing ingredients, listening to the ingredients for uh, for a recipe and say you wanted to add those ingredients to your shopping. List. That's another option that you can do within a recipe like when they are, when it's on the screen or like it's probably saying the ingredients you can say Add all the ingredients to my shopping list you know and then it'll help you shop for that recipe.\n",
      "00:25:43 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK, that's nice.\n",
      "00:25:46 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. All right. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. All right, so while making the shopping list you did add add bananas and of course shampoo. You did that and when you have something on your shopping list and some of the items are already been bought, you can say let's say check off, you know maybe bananas or something like that. You know, so let's do that again.\n",
      "00:26:17 Speaker 2\n",
      "Excuse me.. Can I go to the restroom?\n",
      "00:26:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "Ohh yeah yeah, go ahead please.\n",
      "00:26:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "I’ll just.\n",
      "00:26:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, no worries.\n",
      "00:26:34 Speaker 5\n",
      "Speaker 3. I'm sorry. How do you pronounce your name? \n",
      "Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, go ahead. \n",
      "Speaker 5\n",
      "Oh, I just. I just really like the way you're. You're like, going with the flow with, like, how you address this. It's like I just wanted to thank you. You're really good. \n",
      "Speaker 3\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:26:51 Speaker 9\n",
      "And I feel like maybe we can discuss the future comparison between. An echo show versus regular echo. I feel like that's a very sharp observation. The green Free One may actually be more appropriate for him, yeah.\n",
      "00:27:13 Speaker 3\n",
      "I think so it would.\n",
      "00:27:14 Speaker 9\n",
      "Yeah, and. To go low tech on the devices.\n",
      "00:27:19 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, I think so, yeah.\n",
      "00:27:22 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah. Or that or I was thinking also maybe going a little more specific like showing him top two options for a Mac and cheese or, yeah, a Mac and cheese with a specific type of cheese that he wants.\n",
      "00:27:34 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. Then maybe it might just go on to one option or. something like that.\n",
      "00:27:40 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:27:42 Speaker 3\n",
      "Or maybe like going to a certain recipe from a certain website, you know?\n",
      "00:27:48 Speaker 5\n",
      "Ohh yeah, that's true.\n",
      "00:27:50 Speaker 3\n",
      "Like you know how it shows, yeah, those popular ones, you know, all recipes or something like that. Oh, we were just, UM, Speaker 2 and Mom. We were just talking about how. We could make it more specific for Speaker 2 to use the same device, but have it read the recipe names and like you know which one instead of like having him pick from the screen. So we were just talking about what can be done with the command and. We we were. Just saying that maybe if we asked. The device to only give recipe from a certain website or an app. Like you know how like you know say that give me the recipe for Mac and cheese from allrecipes.com. Or, you know, network or something like that, and then wonder if it will start reading or like, you know it will start giving the instructions you know.\n",
      "00:28:48 Speaker 1\n",
      "Martha Stewart's Mac and cheese kind of fun.\n",
      "00:28:51 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, something like that. And maybe we can definitely try that, but yeah. All right. So Speaker 2, so another thing you can do, let's go back to the shopping list right now. So do you want to add? Bananas and shampoo to your shopping list. Again, no. OK. Do you have anything else that you want to add to your shopping list?\n",
      "00:29:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "00:29:20 Speaker 2\n",

      "I added gum to your shopping list.\n",
      "00:29:37 Speaker 3\n",

But similarly Speaker 2, you can also find like lactose intolerant intolerant recipe if there's someone in your family who needs that kind of recipe. Ah. But we'll move on, let's say. This is a good one for you here for finding a food substitution, say. Maybe you can say find me a substitution for coconut milk.\n",

Or maybe we'll have to find a way on how to change the settings or something where at least they would, you know, give him options and let him pick options by. Yeah. But yeah, all right. OK, Speaker 2, let's do a couple more before we I guess like wrap up. How about finding grams of sugar and sodium in a certain type of food?

You kind of like beat all of us in terms of knowing too much about chemistry and that always help big shout out to Speaker 2. I know we have a small class. Just to be bold, but I don't know Speaker 2, if you noticed, you started off in our first week, just very quiet.\n",

      "Yeah. So I know it's going by really fast. The plan for next week is to actually ask you all to still just go back to your breakout room, check out your homework, and instead of showing you new topics, we don't have new topics. We're done. We just will do some interview with you and your caregiver. In this case. Speaker 2 and Speaker 1, you can come together and share. We will actually give you more private rooms or space. So if you wanted to, for instance, Speaker 6, if you want us to talk to you yourself and then maybe talk to your dad who's also coming potentially via zoom, we can also talk to your caregiver. To see if you have any feedback for the program. Yeah, and that will wrap up our last week. So there will still be a homework for this week that I will send out to you all and next week. Yeah, you will be done and it's going to be our last session alright, yeah. Any questions before we wrap up for today?\n",

      "Yeah, that sounds great. And then another thing I wanted to share with you all, I will share more next. But we also have a have a research project looking at designing homework for you. All you know, after this program ends. So we'll give you some activities and things to try. I know like Speaker 2, you probably want to like learn some more jokes or. The games we have a lot of that, so we'll try to figure out a way to get some of the new content to you all in an easier way that will be some upcoming research. So we'll reach out to you and. Stay in touch, alright? OK, now it's getting late. Thanks so much everyone. And then clinicians, you can stay, but the rest of you have a wonderful. The rest of the day and see you next week, our last week.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.

      "Summary of Findings: Speaker 2 and Speaker 3 had reported benefits to using Speaker 4 for taught skills such as creating to do lists, engaging in auditory games, listening to music, and searching for information. His mother had mentioned that Speaker 2 had maintained learned commands beyond the training: “They go to Costco once a week, so rather than making a written list, Speaker 2 can do the list like that and put it on his phone. And as they're going It'll give Speaker 2 something else to do other than just pushing the cart. He can check off (items).”. One of Speaker 2’s main goals was using Speaker 4 to help him become more independent in his daily activities. His mother had expressed her determination in using Speaker 4 to help Speaker 2 regain the skills he once had before his accident: \" Yeah. I mean, it would be more stuff on its own. And I'd say yes, he has, because it's something that he can do without his dad's help in life.”. Even though both Speaker 2 and Speaker 3 had mentioned benefits of using Speaker 4, there were a few challenges mentioned when engaging in the device, including lack of auditory description when Speaker 4 provides choices on her screen: “If the visually impaired person was doing the training and they were familiar with voice over Apple or any screen reading device, I'm sure it would have read the directions to them.” The absence of auditory description when Speaker 4 provides options to its user elicits the gap between accessibility and blind users. \n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

Uh, think about outfits and topics to talk about. That's super functional. Anything else you can come up with? \n",
      "\n",
      "SPEAKER 2: Um, well, reminders when II had to go over to my physical therapy clinic, like, maybe like an hour before I get ready and you put your shoes on and water bottle and, like, tell my, one of my parents didn't take me over to the clinic. So it'd be like, like maybe like an hour before I get ready. And sometimes, well, when you're in physical therapy, you need to put your hair up in like a ponytail like this not, you're not like, not supposed to have me down. So I need to like physical care before like um go to one of those sessions or um for me, like a reminder will be like, oh, I need to put my lotion on because my skin is like dry all the time. So I need before pt they so massage me. So I need to put my lotion on because I don't want on their ski. \n",

I have speech therapy sessions and II do like maybe like half an hour or like, you know, 20 minutes before. So I'll just get ready for speech because like, um, like bringing topics into our, our session of speech and need to like start conversation. Like one of my speech goals is to it's called initiation, like making a move myself. So like I have all these years of just being kind of responding. Mm OK. That needs to be initiation. That's one of my goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "SPEAKER 1: You sounded amazing. You have a lot of good ideas. We'll definitely work with Angela. She is a close colleague of ours. Um We'll try to bring some ideas for like, topics and everything. Yeah. Ok. Anything else you're on your number five doing very well so far. Think about other reminders, appointments you can customize. \n",
      "\n",
      "SPEAKER 2: Um, maybe, like, I had someone to go over to my credit union, like, on a couple of times a month to see, like, I have some investments or like, shares in my credit union. I need to be either like, oh, I need to do, I go on weekends and need to go over there and get, um, a new, like, investment or the long term. I rather there too so I can pile them up because my dad says for finances usually the LA, um, like right after each other.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

      "1. **Organizational and Reminder Needs:**\n",
      "   - R.T. demonstrates a need for enhanced management of therapy appointments and social engagements due to reliance on technological aids and physical reminders. This suggests underlying cognitive challenges, possibly linked to a past medical history requiring rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Engaged in active cognitive-communication therapy with goals centered on initiation and conversation, indicating ongoing recovery from cognitive deficits. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Technological Integration for Scheduling:**\n",
      "   - Encourage continued dual use of both physical and digital calendars to reinforce routine establishment. This dual-system approach seems effective and should remain an integral part of R.T.'s daily management.\n",
      "   - Explore further customization of reminders using AI assistants (e.g., Alexa) for auditory reminders to complement existing systems, improving R.T.'s autonomy in managing their schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Therapy and Rehabilitation Support:**\n",
      "   - Continue with scheduled speech and physical therapy sessions, emphasizing progress in communication skills (initiation, social interaction) and physical rehabilitation. The use of alarms and reminders prior to these sessions aids preparation and should be continued.\n",
      "   - Consider occupational therapy consults if new challenges in daily living or organization emerge, enhancing R.T.'s capability to manage more complex tasks independently.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Patient Education and Goal Setting:**\n",
      "   - Work collaboratively with R.T. to set realistic and achievable reminders for personal goals (e.g., self-care before therapy like skincare routines, planning interactions for social outings).\n",
      "   - Set long-term goals for financial independence with reminders for financial management tasks, incorporating these into therapy goals to reinforce practical application of skills.\n",
      "  \n",
      "4. **Family and Support Network Involvement:**\n",
      "   - Continue involving family members as required, particularly for transportation to appointments, while encouraging steps towards independent management of other tasks where feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**\n",
      "   - Follow up during therapy sessions to monitor adherence to reminder systems and adjust strategies as needed. Potentially integrate feedback from all engaged therapists (speech, physical, occupational) to fine-tune approaches tailored to R.T.'s evolving needs. \n",

Use, so that'll be kind of cool to see to try to connect. Maybe your Spotify account? Yeah, to Speaker 15. And then I think the more that you use Speaker 15 with the YouTube, it will it.

      "OK. I probably like, I would like to play some Sudoku. Or it's a good mind puzzle game and I'll tell you maybe like I would like to play an audio book or what audiobooks like? Like. I guess some chicken soup for the soul books. And it's, I think the audio version so but on my Spotify. But I wanna play that.\n",
      "00:06:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's great. OK, the next scenario is: I want to ask.\n",
      "00:06:23 Speaker 2\n",
      "I would like to ask about the weather for this weekend. Right. Like, her answer would be like the area I live in. OK, it's gonna happen.\n",
      "00:06:37 Speaker 1\n",
      "Great. OK. Speaker 5, did you have any? Questions or ideas for Speaker 2? Or all good. For the just for the like 10 scenarios, if you wanted to ask her anything more in depth.\n",
      "00:07:08 Speaker 5\n",
      "So. You said like, you like to listen to like old folk music and like something gentle. Is that like, do you is that for like when you're falling asleep or and like you list the other things or is it more just that's the type of music you like.\n",
      "00:07:25 Speaker 2\n",
      "I'm that's the type of music that like, like melodic rock, like from like the 1970s, like Fleetwood Mac and like Joni Mitchell stuff, it's like calming.\n",
      "00:07:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "I wonder if we can program Speaker 6 to start playing that music. Do you like to listen to it while you're falling asleep or? Just before you fall asleep or is it just like when you're resting at home? Not necessarily sleeping.\n",
      "00:07:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "I'm actually I like to listen to it when I'm doing something kind of hard on my laptop, like the mind like, like calm down when I'm doing something kind of hard like like kind of like renew my laboratory license right now and like, I'm like typing to my laptop, answering the questions for like a lab certificate. And then there's a lot of mental like, I just want to listen to them soothing music here.\n",
      "00:08:27 Speaker 5\n",
      "I was thinking just cause like there's you mentioned a couple of different people maybe like we could make a playlist. Yeah. And put those together and then Speaker 6 could just play the playlist of the the songs that you like.\n",
      "00:08:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, I like that. I'll add that. Maybe I want to play a playlist I made that would be really cool to directly play the playlist that you make.\n",
      "00:08:53\n",
      "Already.\n",
      "00:08:53 Speaker 2\n",
      "On Spotify or something like that.\n",
      "00:08:55 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, that's great.\n",
      "00:08:56 Speaker 2\n",
      "Ice and put this on there like. Like the Cleveland Mac rumors album and then like the Red Hot Chili Peppers like last four years. Yeah, cause I like the band too.\n",
      "00:09:09 Speaker 1\n",
      "Ohh yeah, yes. Yes, I can add. I want to. Any specific years of dance music? Yeah.\n",
      "00:09:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "00:09:24 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, that's great. Alright. And then we have one more thing to do. Alright, Speaker 2? So since we learned about how to schedule alerts and reminders last week. Would you, uh, could you demo for us with your Speaker 15 just setting a reminder or an alert for any scenario that you want?\n",
      "00:10:18 Speaker 2\n",
      "Can you set an alarm like like 5 minutes or OK?\n",
      "00:10:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "00:10:26 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 15, can you set an alarm for 5:55 PM? But come on in like 5 minutes.\n",
      "00:10:33 Speaker 15\n",
      "Set for 5:55 PM.\n",
      "00:10:36 Speaker 2\n",
      "That's awesome.\n",
      "00:10:45 Speaker 1\n",
      "Nice. And then what about one more? Let's do. Speaker 2, can you show us a demo of how you would set an appointment with your Speaker 15?\n",
      "00:10:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "Appointment on this. Would that be a notification or routine? Do you remember? So I'm trying to, well, a reminder. And are there routines or notifications?\n",
      "00:12:01 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh a reminder. I think a reminder. Yes it it should be more of like a notification I think. But maybe if you yeah. If you can, you can also. Yeah, we can see.\n",
      "00:12:25 Speaker 2\n",
      "It says that you're all caught up.\n",
      "00:12:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh, and your notifications. OK. Oh, yeah. So I guess to set an appointment or a reminder, we would ask Speaker 15 right to. Hey, Speaker 15, set a reminder for Thursday at 5:30.\n",
      "00:12:52 Speaker 15\n",
      "Yeah. Yes. What time today should I remind you?\n",
      "00:12:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 15, can you set a reminder for 5:20 PM every Thursday?\n",
      "00:13:06 Speaker 6\n",
      "OK, I'll create a reminder for every Thursday at 5:20 PM. By the way, I can notify you when those rain snacking in your area rain. Would you like me to do that?\n",
      "00:13:27 Speaker 2\n",
      "So like, like every week, she's gonna remind me about 10 minutes early so I can get in position, get my little notebook here. So I think they all need to go over that to talk to, like, the Trojan speech girls.\n",
      "00:13:44 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes. Perfect. Exactly. You did a great job.\n",
      "00:13:48 Speaker 5\n",

      "00:13:48 Speaker 2\n",
      "It's good. Like you know, it's like you got your brain up here, but there’s an external, mini brain.\n",
      "00:13:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. So, Speaker 2, you created a really functional reminder.\n",
      "00:14:03 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, it's. Well, I think if I I think things like functional like a deadline because I have a scientific background like I'm, I'm a genius. If something has a protocol, I'm going to go by it step by step.\n",
      "00:14:11 Speaker 1\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "00:14:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, that's good. Yep. You got it down. So you can set. You could exactly how you did. You can say, hey, Speaker 15, set an alarm or timer right for 5:55. So it'll go off. And then same thing. Hey, Speaker 15 set a reminder. Or or hey, Speaker 15 set an appointment. For any. Yeah. So you got it.\n",

      "00:14:53 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, it's going to go off in a minute. We got to wait till the end and then and then, Speaker 2, when the alarm goes off and you want to stop the alarm, what would you say?\n",
      "00:15:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 15, stop alarm.\n",
      "00:15:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "Perfect. Yep.\n",

      "00:19:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:19:26 Speaker 10\n",
      "All right. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, yes. OK. All right, so. When we talk about entertainment, I'm sure everyone has different ways that they think about entertainment and. UM, but these are a few common things that we can do with Speaker 615. So, so we have trivia questions and jokes, video playing different videos or watching different series or trailers. Any of that on Speaker 15 on device? And we can listen to different types of music, different genres, different artists, any any of that. And you can play your music on different streaming services as well. UM and you can also play your own photos like family photos or anything that that you have on your on your Amazon Photos app. So we're gonna go over a few of the few of the comment commands that you can have here for each one of these different categories. And practice, practice those commands. Some of the some of the commands we will take turns practicing as a part of the group and then some of the commands will go into break our rooms again and practice one a month. Alright so. Let's get started. OK, so some of the entertainment categories here. Can be auditory versus some can be visual and auditory both. So only auditory functions that we have tasks that we can do with Speaker 15 related to entertainment, art, trivia, jokes and music, of course. Also, we could do. We could play podcasts as well, which can be auditory, visual, and or auditory, so it would require some visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. It would give you would be videos and photos from from the list that we have here.\n",
      "00:21:48 Speaker 3\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "00:21:50 Speaker 15\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "00:21:52 Speaker 10\n",
      "All right, so here we have. Some commands related to trivia questions, so let's see if we can practice this. Would anyone like to practice and go first practicing one of these commands where you can say Speaker 15? Tell me an interesting sport fact or Speaker 15 tell me an interesting history fact. You can also have Speaker 15 tell you and tell your fun science fact if that's something that interests you. It definitely depends on your interest here. So.\n",
      "00:22:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "Cool.\n",
      "00:22:31 Speaker 10\n",
      "Let's see. Who wants to go first. All right, Speaker 9. Go ahead.\n",
      "00:22:39 Speaker 9\n",
      "Hey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n",
      "00:22:48 Speaker 16\n",

      "00:22:51\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "00:22:53 Speaker 10\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "00:22:55 Speaker 9\n",
      "Hey Speaker 6, tell me an interesting science fact.\n",
      "00:23:00 Speaker 6\n",
      "Here's a fact about science. Science's latest news is will operationalize Annies and Don National Research Foundation. See charming.\n",
      "00:23:10 Speaker 16\n",

      "00:23:53 Speaker 2\n",
      "Wow. OK. Yeah. So in Ethiopia is the hottest place on Earth. You know, I asked her history fact, but told me that.\n",
      "00:23:55 Speaker 10\n",
      "That is a. Yeah, it's it's probably telling you a geographical fact more than a history fact, it seems like but.\n",
      "00:24:09 Speaker 2\n",
      "I learned something new today.\n",
      "00:24:12 Speaker 10\n",
      "Something new? Yeah. And it, of course, it will definitely tell you different facts at different times. So if you ask the same like you know, same thing again it it might be completely different. So yeah, that's the interesting part.\n",
      "00:24:26 Speaker 8\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:24:30 Speaker 10\n",
      "Alright, yeah, go ahead, Speaker 8.\n",
      "00:24:34 Speaker 8\n",
      "Speaker 13, tell me when the Notre Dame in Paris was built.\n",
      "00:24:41 Speaker 13\n",
      "Lock how to draw Notre Dame to Paris in Paris, near to France was completed in 1345.\n",
      "00:24:49 Speaker 8\n",
      "1345 completed.\n",
      "00:24:51 Speaker 10\n",
      "That's all right. That was pretty specific there, Speaker 8, but Yep, it that definitely had the answer. So that's good. Yeah. Alright.\n",
      "00:24:57 Speaker 8\n",
      "Yes, that's. Yes.\n",
      "00:25:05 Speaker 10\n",
      "Speaker 12, are you here? I don't see Speaker 12.\n",
      "00:25:08 Speaker 3\n",
      "Is he here now? \n",
      "00:25:15 Speaker 7\n",
      "Speaker 12, I ask you to unmute. If you're ready to go, feel free to go.\n",
      "00:25:24 Speaker 10\n",
      "I don't know if he's here. I don't see him or hear him.\n",
      "00:25:32 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK. All right, let's move on. If he joins us again. He can go with the next command and I don't know. All right. OK. So let's move on to videos. So videos can be watched on different streaming services. It can be Netflix or Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, anything that you have any kind of streaming service. All. So what we need to do here with the device is you can download that and you have to log into your account for any of the streaming service that you want to use and you're all good to go. So when you then give a command to Speaker 15, it should pick up the command. And play on the on on the on the streaming service that you're requesting it to play play it on.\n",
      "00:26:27\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:26:28 Speaker 10\n",
      "Alright, the same as with music.\n",
      "00:26:28 Speaker 8\n",
      "Where is it? Will it play on Speaker 13 or E5 and not play on my? Sorry.\n",
      "00:26:41 Speaker 13\n",
      "Showing result.\n",
      "00:26:42 Speaker 8\n",
      "Television.\n",
      "00:26:43 Speaker 13\n",
      "You can narrow down these things.\n",
      "00:26:45 Speaker 10\n",
      "So if your television. It is a smart device, it's. It's also a smart TV. And if it has Speaker 13 embedded in it, like if it has a Firestick or it's in in, it's actually in it, then you you're gonna be able to use your voice command and also play it on your TV. But if you don't, then you can play it on your device on your echo show as well.\n",
      "00:27:07 Speaker 8\n",
      "OK. OK.\n",
      "00:27:17 Speaker 10\n",
      "Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It definitely depends on.\n",
      "00:27:19 Speaker 8\n",
      "It has to be safe. It has to be on this smart TV.\n",
      "00:27:23 Speaker 10\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "00:27:28 Speaker 11\n",
      "Correct, correct.\n",
      "00:27:28 Speaker 8\n",
      "It has to be synced on the smart TV.\n",
      "00:27:33 Speaker 10\n",
      "On the smart TV, that's right. Alright. And the same is with music. If you want to play songs or podcasts on Spotify, YouTube or Amazon Music. Or Pandora. Any of the any of the streaming services that you're using, you definitely you. To just have that on your device again or your TV for that matter, and it and once you have that and you're logged in, you can just give the command and it will play it on the device that you want. Want it to play on?\n",
      "00:28:10 Speaker 8\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:28:11 Speaker 10\n",
      "Right. OK, so now that we have some ideas, let's find a video that everyone can watch together.\n",
      "00:28:21 Speaker 3\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "00:28:22 Speaker 10\n",
      "So I have I have. A command here to play a trailer. For the new Minions movie, so let's see if. Does anyone want to go and see if that plays the movie for you?\n",

      "There, it's for the trailer Despicable Me 4, OK?\n",
      "00:28:53 Speaker 9\n",
      "Speaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n",
      "00:29:01 Speaker 11\n",
      "I don't believe she hears you.\n",
      "00:29:03 Speaker 9\n",
      "Speaker 6, can you look up Despicable Me 4?\n",
      "00:29:07 Speaker 6\n",
      "Here you go.\n",

      "And it brought up. Three, it looks like 3 icons for one is Despicable Me 4. Two is Despicable Me 3and three is the minions, the rise of. Whichever. Hey, touch it.\n",
      "00:29:32 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK, got you. OK. So I think, Speaker 9, if you said that Speaker 6, play the trailer for the Despicable Me 4, it will give you the that trailer without you having to go through the options. Do you want to try that again?\n",
      "00:29:49 Speaker 9\n",
      "Speaker 6, can you play the trailer for Despicable Me 4?\n",
      "00:29:57 Speaker 6\n",
      "Here is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n",
      "00:30:02 Speaker 10\n",
      "There you go. Perfect. OK, alright.\n",
      "00:30:07 Speaker 8\n",
      "You can use that scenario without having streamer service.\n",
      "00:30:10 Speaker 11\n",
      "You.\n",
      "00:30:16 Speaker 8\n",
      "Logging into streaming service.\n",
      "00:30:19 Speaker 10\n",
      "Yes. Right. So I think.\n",
      "00:30:21 Speaker 11\n",
      "It's like.\n",
      "00:30:24 Speaker 10\n",
      "Right. It will use the one of the streaming default streaming services I think for for the Speaker 6 app and Amazon itself. I guess the default streaming video service is YouTube. I guess for the videos, so we'll just play. There and for music, I think it's Amazon Music. That's where it will play the music. If you don't have any streaming service that's plugged in or synced in with.\n",
      "00:30:56 Speaker 8\n",
      "Yes, OK.\n",
      "00:30:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "00:31:00 Speaker 10\n",
      "Alright. Is it still playing for you, Speaker 9?\n",
      "00:31:05 Speaker 16\n",
      "Yeah, we paused it.\n",
      "00:31:06 Speaker 10\n",
      "Ohh OK alright. Do you want to say Speaker 6 play and it will start playing again?\n",
      "00:31:15 Speaker 9\n",
      "Hey Speaker 6, can you play?\n",
      "00:31:18 Speaker 11\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "00:31:22 Speaker 10\n",
      "All right. All right, perfect. So here's our road map on how we can control the videos on Speaker 6. So you can have volume to go up and down then pausing and playing like you just did, Speaker 9.\n",
      "00:31:47 Speaker 10\n",
      "And then fast forwarding and going back or rewinding. And also for it to start over again at the beginning of the video. So let's practice so each one of you, maybe we could pick one command and practice the entire road map like that. So let's see. We can go for the volume first. So initially though Umm since who wants to go next to start the trailer? Yes. Speaker 12, do you want to go? Ohh Speaker 8, go ahead.\n",
      "00:32:27 Speaker 8\n",
      "Speaker 6 play the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n",
      "00:32:36 Speaker 13\n",
      "Here is the trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n",
      "00:32:43 Speaker 8\n",
      "Raise the volume. Pause. The trailer. You have to say Speaker 13 raise the volume. Speaker 11 pause the Speaker 13 pause. Speaker 13 play. The trailer.\n",
      "00:33:14 Speaker 9\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:33:14 Speaker 8\n",
      "And.\n",
      "00:33:17 Speaker 7\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "00:33:18\n",
      "And I turn everything into a joke.\n",
      "00:33:21 Speaker 4\n",
      "But I care.\n",
      "00:33:22\n",
      "I want to use that.\n",
      "00:33:24\n",
      "For something important.\n",
      "00:33:25 Speaker 8\n",
      "Was. The video but it came.\n",
      "00:33:26 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK, first back, Speaker 8.\n",
      "00:33:31 Speaker 8\n",
      "It changed its name.\n",
      "00:33:31 Speaker 11\n",
      "That was so good.\n",
      "00:33:34 Speaker 8\n",
      "#3, it didn't respond.\n",
      "00:33:39 Speaker 10\n",
      "All right. Yeah. OK. All right. Alright, who wants to go next? We'll do one more for the for the video. Speaker 12, do you want to go next?\n",
      "00:33:53 Speaker 12\n",
      "I don't know what was going on. I it took me 10 minutes to.\n",
      "00:34:00\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "00:34:01 Speaker 12\n",
      "So I you're you're going. A about a suspect. I didn't know what you were doing.\n",
      "00:34:10 Speaker 10\n",
      "Oh, so so we're we're watching movie trailer. So we're giving Speaker 13 a command and it's playing a movie trailer and. Then we're, we're. Just giving different commands for it to to control the video. So for example increasing volume, decreasing volume, fast forwarding, going back. Pausing, playing different different controls like that. Would you like to try to play a video?\n",
      "00:34:45 Speaker 12\n",
      "I guess so. I don't. OK, so Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me. 4.\n",
      "00:35:10 Speaker 10\n",
      "I think it did not pick up. Is it is it cancelled?\n",
      "00:35:12 Speaker 12\n",
      "Well, Speaker 14, can you?\n",
      "00:35:17 Speaker 14\n",
      "Sorry, I don't know that one.\n",
      "00:35:21 Speaker 8\n",
      "Speaker 13. Pause. Sorry, I'm not sure.\n",
      "00:35:27 Speaker 13\n",
      "I waited a long.\n",
      "00:35:29 Speaker 10\n",
      "Would you like to mute it? OK. There we go. OK. All right, go ahead, Speaker 12.\n",
      "00:35:38 Speaker 12\n",
      "You're welcome. Speaker 14. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. Speaker 14, could you change the control to make it louder?\n",
      "00:35:59 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK. So. See. Let's do this one Speaker 14 volume up two times or Speaker 14 volume down two times.\n",
      "00:36:11 Speaker 12\n",
      "OK, Speaker 14, volume up two times.\n",
      "00:36:21 Speaker 10\n",
      "Is it playing the game?\n",
      "00:36:22 Speaker 12\n",
      "Speaker 14. Speaker 14. Volume. Up two times.\n",
      "00:36:35 Speaker 10\n",
      "Is it playing the trailer on the screen, Speaker 12?\n",
      "00:36:37 Speaker 12\n",
      "It's not.\n",
      "00:36:39 Speaker 10\n",
      "Oh, OK, so maybe it did not pick up the, UM, the command for you.\n",
      "00:36:42 Speaker 2\n",
      "The first one, yeah.\n",
      "00:36:44 Speaker 10\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:36:46 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK. So can you try again to play the trailer? \n",
      "00:36:46 Speaker 14\n",
      "Who's been compromised?\n",
      "00:36:57 Speaker 12\n",
      "Speaker 14, play trailer for Despicable Me 4 or oh, I'm sorry. I I had. I just should have said.\n",
      "00:37:05 Speaker 14\n",
      "Here's the trailer for this.\n",
      "00:37:16 Speaker 10\n",
      "Is it playing now?\n",
      "00:37:18 Speaker 12\n",
      "It is now.\n",
      "00:37:20 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK, alright. Can you do the volume control?\n",
      "00:37:26 Speaker 12\n",
      "Speaker 14. Volume up two times.\n",
      "00:37:32 Speaker 10\n",
      "Stole the statue.\n",
      "00:37:33 Speaker 12\n",
      "Speaker 14. Volume down to times.\n",
      "00:37:40 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK, so that worked right?\n",
      "00:37:43 Speaker 12\n",
      "Well, it didn't go down Speaker 14 volume down to times. That went back.\n",
      "00:37:54 Speaker 10\n",
      "I went back. OK all right.\n",
      "00:37:56 Speaker 6\n",
      "It's.\n",
      "00:37:57 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK, alright. We did pause and play. Good job, Speaker 12. Yeah, perfect. Alright.\n",
      "00:38:00 Speaker 7\n",
      "Good job, Speaker 12.\n",
      "00:38:06 Speaker 12\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:38:08 Speaker 10\n",
      "OK, how about this? Or do we want to go into breakout rooms and practice some of the other commands? And so we have that as well. Speaker 5, do you think so?\n",
      "00:38:21 Speaker 7\n",
      "Yeah, I'm gonna make everyone go back into your breaker room. Your clinician has the entire slide deck and you can decide and choose where you want to pick up your practices. There are other jokes or fun facts you can explore on the screen, so let's go in to break our rooms and we'll practice on our own.\n",
      "00:38:43 Speaker 7\n",
      "But I'm glad everyone got a chance to at least go for a turn to try the video or the music, so have fun.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------- 1:1 Interview ----------------------------------------------\n",

Thanks to your Speaker 15. All right, so we are. Speaker 4 was, was there a trailer or a movie that you're looking forward to?\n",
      "00:39:57 Speaker 2\n",
      "And think what's coming out? Yeah, same.\n",
      "00:40:03 Speaker 1\n",
      "I guess do you did you want to?\n",
      "00:40:06 Speaker 4\n",
      "Like, I think there's some movie twisters about, like tornadoes.\n",
      "00:40:14 Speaker 1\n",
      "You know Speaker 2.\n",
      "00:40:16 Speaker 2\n",
      "I do. Yeah. It's about tornado chasers.\n",
      "00:40:19 Speaker 4\n",
      "You know those people who chase them like, you know, that's completely out of my field. But I just wanna check it out.\n",
      "00:40:26 Speaker 1\n",
      "Well, that actually sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, I never even knew.\n",
      "00:40:30 Speaker 4\n",
      "You know, you know these people are kind of a rough bunch, but like they found each other.\n",
      "00:40:37 Speaker 1\n",
      "Exactly. Like, yeah, you would maybe think that you're the only one who is.\n",
      "00:40:44 Speaker 4\n",
      "But they they're like the whole gang of them make a big squad, like. Well, I remember the trailer was like some science girl from a university that, like, actual knowledge about tornadoes and this rough guy chaser guy is, like kind of like a like a little bit of a. From come with the science girl and the Tornado chaser. Bad boy, it was like. But it's like, you know, there's like, big tornadoes. Check it out.\n",
      "00:41:17 Speaker 1\n",
      "Ohh wow. Oh my goodness. OK, so yes, Speaker 4, do you want to go ahead and ask Speaker 15 to play the trailer for that movie?\n",
      "00:41:28 Speaker 2\n",
      "And remember they. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twister?\n",
      "00:41:42 Speaker 15\n",
      "I don't have a.\n",
      "00:41:45 Speaker 4\n",
      "She's telling me she doesn't have a trailer.\n",
      "00:41:47 Speaker 2\n",
      "I think it's twisters with an asset.\n",
      "00:41:50 Speaker 4\n",
      "Oh, yes. OK. Yeah, yeah. OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for the movie Twisters?\n",
      "00:42:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "Woah, it did it. All right, so I'm going to go to our road map, right. And. Speaker 24, do you want to command, Speaker 15? So if you want to customize it, you can say maybe we can start with Speaker 15 volume up. While she's playing the trailer, so if if Speaker 15 has stopped, you can command Speaker 15 to sit, start playing the trailer again.\n",
      "00:42:43 Speaker 4\n",
      "Alright, OK. Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n",
      "00:43:01 Speaker 1\n",
      "Great. And then let's have Speaker 15 raise the volume.\n",
      "00:43:07 Speaker 4\n",
      "Speaker 15 volume up two times loud. Yeah, great job.\n",
      "00:43:17 Speaker 1\n",
      "She's good at. She's listening.\n",
      "00:43:18 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yeah, people, man listening part of the computer take over our lives. Yeah.\n",
      "00:43:28 Speaker 1\n",
      "And then, Speaker 4, do you want to try Speaker 15 volume down to times?\n",
      "00:43:40 Speaker 4\n",
      "Speaker 15, can you play the trailer for Twisters?\n",
      "00:43:46 Speaker 15\n",
      "Here's the trailer for twisters.\n",
      "00:43:50 Speaker 4\n",
      "Speaker 15, can you turn the volume down to times?\n",
      "00:43:56 Speaker 4\n",
      "It went down. Up and down, yeah.\n",
      "00:44:03 Speaker 1\n",
      "The great this is the case where you want to control the volume. So you can tell Speaker 15 to, yeah, increase the volume volume up or volume down. All right. Great job, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:44:21 Speaker 4\n",
      "Like sometimes like what? Your friends come over. You wanna play a movie and you should be either volume up or down.\n",
      "00:44:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, exactly. You can customize it.\n",
      "00:44:32 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:44:34 Speaker 1\n",
      "And then let's see if we can pause and play so. Let's think of. Maybe we can think of. A YouTube video. Since you already watched YouTube, right? Trying to think. Is there a channel that you like, Speaker 4?\n",
      "00:45:01 Speaker 4\n",
      "Well, you know, and isn't the Olympics coming up soon to maybe do something about like opening ceremonies or something?\n",
      "00:45:11 Speaker 1\n",
      "Sure, that's perfect. So. Yes. How would you ask Speaker 6 to play the Olympics opening ceremony?\n",
      "00:45:24 Speaker 4\n",
      "I'd probably say, Speaker 15, can you play the stream of the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games? Or something like that.\n",
      "00:45:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "That yeah, we can try that or you can even simplify it. And just say Speaker 15 play the Olympics opening ceremony.\n",
      "00:45:43 Speaker 15\n",
      "Yeah, OK. I didn't hear that. Here's what I found.\n",
      "00:45:55 Speaker 4\n",
      "Well, after you said play opening ceremony, you said a game. TV and movie shows about chasing gold is like a streaming up this guy running the Olympics and then. Also, this old guy Patreon patron, probably 1700s, so it's like.\n",
      "00:46:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "No.\n",
      "00:46:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "Doesn't it doesn't have a stream yet, but like maybe it can. They can like usually that like like the channel and NBC has like a running stream. So anyway, can you ask for it?\n",
      "00:46:25 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:46:36 Speaker 2\n",
      "NBC's opening ceremonies or something like that.\n",
      "00:46:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes. Do you want to go ahead and try? Cause that's exactly that's my experience too. When when we ask Speaker 15 to play a topic or or. Yeah, just something. Yeah. Just like a general topic.\n",
      "00:46:55 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:46:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "She will give you a list and then you can say, OK, Speaker 15 play the first video or even click on it. But yeah, let's go ahead and try maybe Speaker 15 play.\n",
      "00:47:04 Speaker 10\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:47:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "The NBC stream of the Olympics. OK, OK.\n",
      "00:47:20 Speaker 15\n",
      "Speaker 15. It heard your voice. Speaker 15, can you play the NBC stream of Olympic Games?\n",
      "00:47:30 Speaker 6\n",
      "Here are some results. Ohh.\n",
      "00:47:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "Speaker 4 did she? Did she give you a relevant video or?\n",
      "00:47:43 Speaker 2\n",
      "No, she sent me a video of pics of hip pocket tease in Olympia. Like it was like 2000 years ago, like the Olympics were like some ancient Greek gods from like, a long.\n",
      "00:47:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "Time ago. That's OK. Yeah, it might. It might. It is specific. Maybe yeah, but that's good. I think it's good to kind of understand what Speaker 15 can come to that.\n",
      "00:48:12 Speaker 4\n",
      "Think you are nice and she thinks it's like it's not what I want.\n",
      "00:48:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:48:17 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, exactly. So sometimes, yeah, we've got to just maybe go more general or more specific, but yeah, it's not going to be perfect for sure. But I think it's always good to still ask because she will give us some options.\n",
      "00:48:38 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yeah, it's good for me to get familiarized with this.\n",
      "00:48:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey. Yeah. Yes, yes. So let's, I'd like to, actually, I like the idea of the Olympic Games. Should we ask Speaker 15 to play? A video of the Olympic Games, and then let's. Let's I want you to choose which one you'd like to view, and then we can play it. So let's go ahead and do that.\n",
      "00:49:05 Speaker 4\n",
      "Speaker 15, can you play a video of the Olympic Games?\n",
      "00:49:11 Speaker 15\n",
      "There are ways to watch Olympics Hippocrates in Olympia.\n",
      "00:49:17 Speaker 4\n",
      "It's like money need to stream. It's old and think.\n",
      "00:49:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh, this should give you prime. Is that the prime?\n",
      "00:49:24 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yeah. And once we do prime about some Olympic guy Hippocrates and Olympics long time ago.\n",
      "00:49:35 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, let's see how we can word this. UM. Oh, how about should we try something even more simple? Let's try Speaker 15. Play the Olympic Games and let's just see what she brings up for us.\n",
      "00:49:57 Speaker 4\n",
      "Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games?\n",
      "00:50:02 Speaker 15\n",
      "Here you go.\n",
      "00:50:08 Speaker 1\n",
      "Are they relevant videos? No. Oh, no, really.\n",
      "00:50:10 Speaker 4\n",
      "Oh. Ohh, maybe I need to say Olympic Games 2024 or something.\n",
      "00:50:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh, yes, yes. Let's try that. Good. Being more specific.\n",
      "00:50:23 Speaker 4\n",
      "Yeah, Speaker 15, can you play the Olympic Games 2024?\n",
      "00:50:32 Speaker 15\n",
      "There are ways to watch chasing gold. Harris, 2024.\n",
      "00:50:40 Speaker 4\n",

      "00:53:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Perfect. So that's kind of like a restart, yeah. And then you can yes, ask Speaker 15 to play on YouTube, any videos it could be like play cat videos or you know something or the Olympic Games. But yes, like Speaker 2 said, you can add on YouTube to be more specific. OK. Yeah. So, Speaker 4, let's try and go ahead and play a video so we can practice more commands with any videos that play.\n",

      "Yeah. \n",
      "01:00:50 Speaker 1\n",

But great job, Speaker 4, thank. Yeah, you did really well, Speaker 2. Sorry. Is there anything you'd like to add or?\n",
      "01:01:21 Speaker 2\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.

      "00:00:06 Speaker 1\n",
      "All right. How are you doing, Speaker 3?\n",
      "00:00:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm doing well because today around half day I went over to my community pool with my dad and we did some treading water and like no water. I'm trying to get back into the pool but like just, you know, it's good for me to be in the water. So. I'm happy because of that. \n",
      "00:00:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. That's really great.\n",
      "00:00:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "So Speaker 6 will be coming in a little bit, so we're going to get started without her. Let me just. Pull up. What I need OK. If you're still trying to fix your computer, I can still give you a minute or I can start. Just let me know when you'r ready.\n",
      "00:01:08 Speaker 3\n",
      "Maybe you can just start or I can like. Stop video and see what happens, and this is the same so they can move. It's that laptop cameras not working OK. But I can just still listen to you.\n",
      "00:01:25 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, Speaker 5 is that is that going to be fine? OK. Perfect. OK. Umm, so we were gonna try to look at what we did last week. So last week we were going through and doing playing music or looking at the videos. So I was going to see if you could show me how to play a music or video from your Speaker 7.\n",
      "00:02:00 Speaker 3\n",
      "Ohh yeah, I'm Speaker 7. I I just asked her to like go on YouTube and like, play a song and she just. I just do it that way. Just ask for the YouTube video and she plays it when I just say play this.\n",
      "00:02:08 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. So let's see. So last week you were trying to pull up the Olympic ceremonies. I know it was having a difficult time. Did you want to try to pull that up again? Or try something different.\n",
      "00:02:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "Maybe I'll try to play some music or something.\n",
      "00:02:43 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:02:45 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, just ask her, OK? Speaker 7. Can you play Banning CA on YouTube.\n",
      "00:02:57 Speaker 7\n",
      "What you need to?\n",
      "00:03:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "It's just still searching?\n",
      "00:03:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "Oh yeah, it's playing right now. Like the YouTube is trying to show you on my phone, but. Just playing the song.\n",
      "00:03:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "So I can't. I can't hear it, but I last week we worked on turning the volume up and the volume down. Could you try doing that this time?\n",
      "00:03:31 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. All right. OK. Speaker 7, can you turn the volume down? Speaker 7, can you turn the sound up?\n",
      "00:03:55 Speaker 1\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "00:03:56 Speaker 3\n",
      "Can you stop the video? So it's in there somewhere. I stopped it. Yeah.\n",
      "00:04:05 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, great. I think that was easier than last week too.\n",
      "00:04:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, because like you know, I've done it most of the times last week. You know, it's indoor rain somewhere, so I can just do it again.\n",
      "00:04:22 Speaker 1\n",
      "Have you been working on it throughout the week?\n",
      "00:04:26 Speaker 3\n",
      "Ohh yeah, like this. I think it was Tuesday we were playing. Like it it like UM. We're listening. I was asking them Speaker 7 to play another song and this it's like I wanted to listen to it and she pulled it up and it's like. Something to getting used to doing.\n",
      "00:04:50 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, that's great. That's super and that's super useful.\n",
      "00:04:54 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, I know it's new thing is getting part of my routine and saying make her play song and do.\n",
      "00:05:05 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's great. Have you have you set it up to the playlist that you made?\n",
      "00:05:15 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, I just ask Speaker 7 like to go on YouTube and like for an artist and just like it just kind of plays some one night for each other. So I'm just, I just go by artist. Yeah.\n",
      "00:05:28 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Great. Today we're going to be talking about self-care needs. So I wanted to find out what type of self-care or health related activity. Do you have difficulties managing?\n",
      "00:05:54 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well. Trying to think, well, like selfcare is like when they, like tried to. Like she like, want, like, want to look good in the mirror and look at my do my hair and stuff sometimes. Like ohh. My left arm is kind of weaker at this point in our recovery, so my hair up in a ponytail or headband or something. It's like sometimes it's kind of a struggle to get into place.\n",
      "00:06:26 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:06:27\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:06:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "Is there anything else that can? Be a little bit difficult.\n",
      "00:06:37 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, I put a lot of lotion on my skin cause I like being in the pool and chlorine eats her skin, so I put it on a lot and so sometimes like I want to put a lot of lotion on and sometimes it gets like your clothes kind of get too lotiony. It's too much on your it's kind of like on your shirt and stuff like. Too much so. So you have to find it in the middle, like too much or too little.\n",
      "00:07:11 Speaker 1\n",
      "Is it because you squeeze out too much?\n",
      "00:07:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "I squeeze out too much and then I go there, put this on my face.\n",
      "00:07:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, OK. And then you have a lot.\n",
      "00:07:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "Of extra. Yeah. So like, I'll put it back in a plastic bag.\n",
      "00:07:26 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Anything else that self-care related?\n",
      "00:07:39 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm well, I'm trying to. Cut down my process. Food in my diet, to where like my eat more like natural food than fruits and grains, and my diet. Not eating like processed food or fast food or like like frozen meals I'm kind of. And make my diet more healthy, so it's good for my overall health. I'm trying to cut those out of my diet.\n",
      "00:08:09 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. And and maybe maybe with the food, do you have any technologies or tools? That can help you manage these needs.\n",
      "00:08:24 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, I can. Like. Tell my smartphone to. Like. Read me my my shopping list or then say say it to me out loud and so say if I want to go to the grocery store, I want to get that. Not that. So are you gonna get this this this. So it's like in my mind it backs up and ohh I need to shop for this. Then that one too. So I sometimes use that like I need to make a little list in my phone.\n",
      "00:09:03 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's great. Like, I mean, yeah, really useful.\n",
      "00:09:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "I know. Yeah, I like listening everything cause like my background is in science and protocols are all this usually step by step by step.\n",
      "00:09:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you typically when you're making the list? UM. Do you? Like is it on your computer or? What do you what do you make? Your list on.\n",
      "00:09:35 Speaker 3\n",
      "Oh, on my like my iPhone, there's a little UM notes app, so like if I'm in my in the store I have my phone with me all the time. I don't have a little. I usually get a piece of paper and write it by hand. But if I have it on my phone, out in public, I can just look at it. But. Trying and I can just hold in my hand and look at that. I need to go down the aisle and. Get some milk or something.\n",
      "00:10:00 Speaker 1\n",
      "All right, that's great. And then I was wondering, Speaker 3, when you were talking about squeezing out the lotion. Sometimes it squeezes too much. Is that due to weakness? In your arm.\n",
      "00:10:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "I think it's a combination of. Like weak arm and also how much pressure I can. I'm supposed to use or. I think it's either too much or too little. It's like just. To like round it out, see like. I think it only did like a little squeeze or that I squeeze it too hard. It's like all of it out.\n",
      "00:10:37 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you use one hand or two hands?\n",
      "00:10:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "I always use my left hand, it's dominant, but I probably need to use both to too. So in my head I think it's just one hand and I actually need to use 2.\n",
      "00:10:52 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. I mean that makes sense. Sometimes I like to use one hand because it seems convenient, but.\n",
      "00:10:59 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, and that's not what I'm supposed to do.\n",
      "00:11:03 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. But that's that's good. And that's the way that you can help manage in the future? UM. OK, let's see. So I have something, but I don't know if you take, do you take medications? You don't have to tell me what or any.\n",
      "00:11:27 Speaker 3\n",
      "Ohh I take medication regularly. I have a little pill case in my bathroom I take I have daily doses to take, yeah.\n",
      "00:11:33 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. OK, So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to think of. 10 scenarios to complete this the sentence, so I want to learn to manage my medications. Or slash take care of myself more about. Let's see. So I read the question kind of funny. OK, so I want to learn how to manage my medications or take care of myself more about.\n",
      "00:12:28 Speaker 6\n",
      "Hi. Sorry I'm. I'm so sorry I'm late. I've been commuting to Rancho every single day so. But. Where's Speaker 3?\n",
      "00:12:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm I'm actually having some camera issues, but I'm here.\n",
      "00:12:44 Speaker 6\n",
      "OK. Hi, Speaker 3. \n",
      "00:12:44 Speaker 3\n",
      "Hi, Speaker 6. \n",
      "00:12:44 Speaker 6\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "00:12:51 Speaker 1\n",
      "We were just going to try and work on coming up with some sentences about managing our medication or self-care. So is there anything that you want to maybe have to learn to manage medications or anything that you think would help?\n",
      "00:13:21 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well. I I say I take daily medication for my. I have like dose. I got regular dosage ofpills for like anti seizure meds and  I just need to take them twice daily so maybe I need to put like alarms on my phone for the times it's supposed to go and like oh, I know that that's for that.\n",
      "00:13:50 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so alarms you said two times a day.\n",
      "00:13:52 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, I take one early morning, one late night. Yeah. So I have twice a day pills for anti seizure.\n",
      "00:14:00 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. So doing an alarm.\n",
      "00:14:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, alarm.\n",
      "00:14:11 Speaker 1\n",
      "All right. And then. Are there other things for managing that? There's other aspects besides medication that you think for self-care that maybe you can have something, maybe Speaker 7 help manage?\n",
      "00:14:36 Speaker 3\n",
      "Maybe like I have like well alarms would be like you know I have physical therapy appointments or speech sessions like maybe I'll ask her to. Like makes me have like. A. A reminder like 30 minutes before or something cause like my PD clinic is like like a couple streets away from my house. So I need to like the little time to get ready.\n",
      "00:15:04\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:15:07 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, that's great. And then maybe if we're trying to come up with something for uh. Like maybe another thing to help with like if you have your medications for taking besides like just an alarm for time, we could have it set up something about the dosage instructions or potential side effects.\n",
      "00:15:38 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, I could just maybe ask her to do a reminder of like, UM. Check the like when we check the side of the bottle or something like that. So like they have a little medicine like like little fact sheet about what this is for. Yeah. Maybe like right, maybe about like 20 minutes before. I'm just taking this look, look at the side of the bottle or something like that.\n",
      "00:16:12 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you is do you always take the same amount of the same medication?\n",
      "00:16:18 Speaker 3\n",
      "Currently, but my neurologist, he said in like a week or two he's gonna, like, face out one and switch it with another. So I need to. I'm in like transition right now. So I'm it's like in the next couple weeks I'm going to like switch one out and get a new one.\n",
      "00:16:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Yeah.  So for that one, will the dosage change?\n",
      "00:16:48 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, the dosages would change like one postman faced out and then one is building up this new one is. So this is will be going up.\n",
      "00:16:57 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Are you going to take it the same amount of times a day?\n",
      "00:17:02 Speaker 3\n",
      "Oh yeah, it's both twice a day, but they're on the new pill is higher now and the I'm phasing out the old one that was on SO1 going up, one going down.\n",
      "00:17:16 Speaker 1\n",
      "All right, so we could set up something that will because it's going to be a new dosage, maybe to remind you about what dosage to take possibly.\n",
      "00:17:29 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, that would be a good reminder.\n",
      "00:17:33 Speaker 1\n",
      "Is there anything else that you that could help you manage the medication or manage you know, other aspects of self-care? That we talked about.\n",
      "00:17:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, I think that those are my 2. Issues in self-care right now, like with this weakness, weakness and like on my left side. But I wanna try to do my hair or put it in a ponytail or back behind my face like I'm trying to do it evenly. But this left side. Not always there. And then taking my daily medication, then sticking to this like the doses aren't supposed to be on right now. And also I'm I'm supposed to be doing daily stretches for my PT clinic to make my body open up. So I think they need to get reminders for that too.\n",
      "00:18:33 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Yeah, yeah, that would be great.\n",
      "00:18:38 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, because I have a little packet. They gave me a little like, oh, do this one do this one they like. I'm supposed to actually do them. Speaker 7 reminds me of it. OK, you. Need to do it.\n",
      "00:18:51 Speaker 1\n",
      "Sorry, I froze for a second, so I wasn't sure what happened. Go ahead, sorry.\n",
      "00:19:12 Speaker 6\n",
      "Yeah, it's like it was. It was breathing for me. Breaking up for me a little bit. These are great. I just want to make sure we also ask. Sorry, I sorry, I missed the beginning. Have we asked Speaker 3 the goals yet or what her goal is or? Oh, we have, OK.\n",
      "00:19:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "What her goal is?\n",
      "00:19:38 Speaker 6\n",
      "So. Yes, so we can. So, Speaker 3, what is your goal with Speaker 7? What do you hope to use Speaker 7 for?\n",
      "00:19:51 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm I'm well. Currently I'm trying to do. I have my cell phone having alarms and daily planned activities like, you know, go to the USC election meeting it makes like a little noise and I need to have my Speaker 7 like back her up too or something. Ohh, go to your like tomorrow over at Chapman has Irvine campus. I live in Irvine so I go to PT over there, so about like. 45 minutes before. I just need to go get dressed, so maybe I can have Speaker 7 give me reminders and I'll I'll do this then.\n",
      "00:20:32 Speaker 6\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "00:20:34 Speaker 3\n",
      "So I just like how, UM, the Alex. I'm trying to use here right now. It's like I have my alarms and my reminders on my phone but need to have when you have two things telling you what to do is easier.\n",
      "00:20:49 Speaker 6\n",
      "Yes, I think Speaker 7 is a great tool for you, especially when you're at home and it gives you that extra reminder to, you know, tie your hair or check. Yeah. Check. You know, 30 minutes before you have your PT session remind you to get ready. Like, oh, it's time to get ready. Yeah. OK.\n",
      "00:21:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "I need to get ready and leave. Yeah, because like you know, PT or a different album, there's like a speech that we can wear jeans and a top PD and wear your leggings and your hair in the back and the bun. And like, like fitness shoes. It's like it's different.\n",
      "00:21:29 Speaker 6\n",
      "True, right? OK reminders or?\n",
      "00:21:38 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, because my different appointments are different. You need to look different ways.\n",
      "00:21:46 Speaker 6\n",
      "That's right. All right. Everything looks great, so I wonder if the other. Groups are done. But yeah, how are how are both your weeks so far?\n",
      "00:22:08 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm I'm happy because. Feels like, you know, actual summer like. Kind of hot, but I like it.\n",
      "00:22:16 Speaker 6\n",
      "Yeah, me too. I love the hot, the warm weather. What about you, Speaker 1?\n",

      "00:22:51 Speaker 1\n",
      "Weak not this week. This weekend. I think I'm just gonna try to be a little productive so I can enjoy. But my cohort actually went to the beach earlier.\n",

      "00:23:41 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well. I do a lot of therapy sessions because I live in Irvine and Chapman University has a Irvine campus for like biotech and like also like nursing school and like speech, SRP's like speech, language and so like I go there for a lot of things and. Well, they're on summer break right with summer session. So it's and like working on my socializing with them like, you know, they're my peers. So I'm just trying to make make my summer like progress towards like socializing with, like, people my own age, like in the future when I return to lab work, like, I'll be around people my own age, so that's my goal right now.\n",
      "00:24:23 Speaker 6\n",
      "Well, that's awesome. I love that, good goals to work towards. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go back to the main room so we can learn some more skills about medication, OK.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------- Group Therapy ---------------------------------------------\n",
      "00:25:23 Speaker 4\n",
      "Alright, if thank everyone's back, I'm going to share my screen again and we're going to practice a couple and then we'll go back into our breakout rooms. OK so. It's going to be a two-part command, but first we're going to use our Lexa to create a medication list for the sake of practicing as a group. We can do like a over the counter medication like by Advil or Tylenol as practice. So does anyone want to go first?\n",
      "00:26:09 Speaker 8\n",
      "Well, I can do it. Speaker 13. Give me a. Tell. Naproxen. Pill.\n",
      "00:26:25 Speaker 13\n",
      "Are you trying to shop for Naproxen pill?\n",
      "00:26:28 Speaker 8\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "00:26:32 Speaker 13\n",
      "One moment. Showing results from Naproxen Pill. The first one is Amazon Basic care back and muscle pain. Naproxen Sodium tablets, 220 milligrams, 90 count.\n",
      "00:26:50 Speaker 8\n",
      "OK, they. She wants me to pick up that naproxen pill, so that's good. I I can. Maybe I didn't. Tell our ask. Properly. I'll do it again.\n",

      "Or like sometimes I go to like. I mean, I'm going to like a session now, I guess like my PT clinic is on the right and that one right there is on the route just to get it on the way or something like that.\n",
      "00:49:05 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, that would be super, super helpful.\n",
      "00:49:07 Speaker 3\n",
      "You know, because like, well sometimes like. They make me work at PT, so maybe on the way back I need to get. Some Tylenol.\n",
      "00:49:18 Speaker 6\n",
      "Nice.\n",
      "00:49:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "So, Speaker 3, do you do your laundry?\n",
      "00:49:24 Speaker 3\n",
      "I do, but I I just took time. I've been right now I don't have a lot right now, but sometimes like, well, I have a little bin. If it's full, I can do one little. But it's only about like half full right now, so. I usually when my bin is full, I can stick it in. It's like 1 load per bin so.\n",
      "00:49:46 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Do you just wait till it gets full or do you do it? You know, once a week or once a month or.\n",
      "00:49:55 Speaker 3\n",
      "I usually rely on my bin like cause it's a size about like one load and usually I have. It's just like I usually label everything is like color like colors and cotton cause like it washes everything even though something so like. Different kinds of fabric. When you wash it all together, I have like a dyed a towel with a cut, cut, cut color in it. I have white underwear. They get dyed.\n",
      "00:50:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "So do you read it?\n",
      "00:50:32 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes, and I use separate and then also I do my sheets once a month like the sheets in my bed. So I have to do that load by itself like with like a hot wash like hot temperature because like. It's cotton and it it kills like stuff on my bed and needs to get it. Clean.\n",
      "00:50:54 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Yeah, that's great. OK. So this one, the first step is how to do laundry. So I know you do your own laundry, but we can ask Speaker 7 and see how Speaker 7 says to do laundry.\n",
      "00:51:09 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, I’ll try. OK Speaker 7. How do I do my laundry? She gave me a couple. Then you click on or maybe select number one.\n",
      "00:51:32 Speaker 4\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:51:37 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, so Speaker 7 select number 1.\n",
      "00:51:44 Speaker 7\n",
      "From nearly dark 18. To give stretch things out of white clothing, use a one to one ratio of dish soap, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, and enough water to soak. A shallow bucket works well. Once the item is soaked for 30 minutes, washer is usually when you're ready to do laundry, zip it and tossing the load.\n",
      "00:52:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, she just read to me about how to. Wash UM sweat stains out of UM like white clothing and using like a a combo of baking soda and and soap and hydrogen peroxide. Different like ratios and you say? Ohh stick it in.\n",
      "00:52:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's really helpful.\n",
      "00:52:33 Speaker 3\n",
      "You know, it's like, well, it's really I liked how it's really different like you know, when you have a scientific procedure different like it's like different parts of it like you have got the whole like procedures, then you have the the beginning, this and this and this it is scientific.\n",
      "00:52:59 Speaker 6\n",
      "I love that. It's all, it's all like analogy, right? They're all analogy, yeah.\n",
      "00:53:12 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so I was thinking that we could try to set a reminder for to do it at a specific time because you do your sheets once a month. Maybe you can have Speaker 7. You can pick a date and then just have Speaker 7 tell you on that date.\n",
      "00:53:30 Speaker 4\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "00:53:33 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 7. Can you set a reminder for me to do my laundry on August 15th?\n",
      "00:53:43 Speaker 7\n",
      "What time should I remind you?\n",
      "00:53:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "8:00 AM.\n",
      "00:53:51 Speaker 7\n",
      "OK, I'll create a reminder for August 15th at 8:00 AM.\n",
      "00:53:57 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, she just made a reminder for me, she said. 8:00 AM on August. August 15th, halfway through the month, and. I have no appointments during that early morning time.\n",
      "00:54:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh, perfect.\n",
      "00:54:14 Speaker 3\n",
      "It worked for my schedule.\n",
      "00:54:18 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "00:54:22 Speaker 6\n",
      "And Speaker 3, on the Speaker 7 screen, does it say laundry as the name of the reminder or? Maybe you can ask Speaker 7 to. Show you your reminders. Alright? Yeah.\n",
      "00:54:43 Speaker 3\n",
      "Speaker 7, can you show me my reminders?\n",
      "00:54:55 Speaker 6\n",
      "Do you? Do you see one that says laundry on August 15th, or it's just a blank?\n",
      "00:55:00 Speaker 3\n",
      "It's no, it's there's a bunch of them, so it says on August 15th. Do my laundry 8:00 AM and then. And. So every Thursday at like 520 prepare for Trojan space and then. Friday. Tomorrow it says. Half an hour PT, so it's 12:00 PM. Half an hour. That's like a reminder and then. I have my dosage. For taking my meds in the morning and night time, so I think there's about. Looks like there's about six things in the reminder list for me now. So I'm happy.\n",
      "00:56:00 Speaker 6\n",
      "That's awesome. And you did them all. Yeah, I think you.\n",
      "00:56:05 Speaker 3\n",
      "We may have a step by step. It's easier for me to think that way.\n",
      "00:56:09 Speaker 6\n",
      "Yeah, you set them all up very nicely. Very good. OK, next one.\n",
      "00:56:18 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so we can do the stains out. You kind of did that one when you asked how they did the laundry, she kind of told you how to get. The stains out. Maybe we can try the one about fabric softener.\n",
      "00:56:40 Speaker 3\n",
      "Uhm, OK, I'll try the command, OK. Hey. Speaker 7. When do I use fabric softener?\n",
      "00:56:59 Speaker 7\n",
      "Every cycle, but it is usually recommended to use it every few washes.\n",
      "00:57:06 Speaker 3\n",
      "Wow, she just told me that. It's used in every cycle or. Can we rotate it like recommended every two or? Every, every other wash and. Every like and as needed. So to add your fabric softener thing. It's like kind of your own choice you do you need it or you can just let it go.\n",
      "00:57:31 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh, OK. Do you use fabric softener?\n",
      "00:57:41 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yes, if like the item we're trying to wash. Can be kind of like like stretched out. So I need to make it. So some things need to be a little crisp anywhere.\n",
      "00:57:57 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, that's great. Let's try the next one. OK, so this one. So if your head's really hurting and you have a headache or a migraine. We can try to ask Speaker 7 how to how do we would treat that.\n",
      "00:58:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "All right. OK, cool. Speaker 7, how do I treat a migraine?\n",
      "00:58:29 Speaker 7\n",
      "There's something I found on reference.com. Home remedies for migraine food applying ice packs to the back of the head with temple taking and not taking a warm shower or bath inside, drinking water resting, and with physical therapy.\n",
      "00:58:52 Speaker 3\n",
      "Ohh, she just read off things to do. You have migraine symptoms and different techniques you can do like put ice on the back of your neck or go to PT clinic and. Like soothe yourself.\n",
      "00:59:09 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you ever get migraines?\n",
      "00:59:12 Speaker 3\n",
      "I actually do not get migraines.\n",
      "00:59:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, good.\n",
      "00:59:17 Speaker 3\n",
      "But some people do. It's like a lot of people.\n",
      "00:59:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, those are good ways to help if you if you do get migraines. But even if you get a headache they might help.\n",
      "00:59:26 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, like it's good to like. Like sometimes you just want to like, listen to some chill music and just. Check out.\n",
      "00:59:39 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah, that could help too.\n",
      "00:59:41 Speaker 3\n",
      "Like sometimes, like when they're doing a lot of other things with my day, sometimes you have to take a break.\n",
      "00:59:50 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, that's really helpful. OK. Should we try another one? OK, this one's for stomach pains, OK.\n",
      "00:59:58 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'll try, OK. Speaker 7. What do I take for stomach pains?\n",
      "01:00:08 Speaker 7\n",
      "I don't know that one.\n",
      "01:00:12 Speaker 3\n",
      "He just said. I don't know that one.\n",
      "01:00:20 Speaker 1\n",
      "Well, let's see. So what? What is something we could take for stomach pain? There's medicine like.\n",
      "01:00:31 Speaker 3\n",
      "Like anti acid or something like that like so everyone has different pains.\n",
      "01:00:38 Speaker 1\n",
      "I think wasn't there when you put on your medication list.\n",
      "01:00:41 Speaker 3\n",
      "Ohh, like Tylenol? Like a pain med.\n",
      "01:00:45 Speaker 7\n",
      "Interactive adventures with character.\n",
      "01:00:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Or Pepto bismol.\n",
      "01:00:49 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, Pepto bismol.\n",
      "01:00:52 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, that I think might have been on that list too. So we could read the list off of like medications that you would take. Help remember.\n",
      "01:01:06 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah. Speaker 7, can you read me my medication list?\n",

      "I don't know.\n",
      "01:01:21 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, she just read it to me. Pepto Bismol and Tylenol.\n",
      "01:01:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Yeah.\n",
      "01:01:31 Speaker 3\n",
      "She she read it.\n",
      "01:01:34 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, great. Should we try one more?\n",
      "01:01:41 Speaker 3\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "01:01:43 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, so for this one it says finding a specific healthcare provider, so we could probably tell Speaker 7 what kind of doctor give a like, what kind of doctor would you want to find?\n",
      "01:01:56 Speaker 3\n",
      "I'm probably a good dentist, so you specific Doctor. OK, I command her OK. Speaker 7. Find me a dentist.\n",
      "01:02:13 Speaker 7\n",
      "Found a few options for them. It was Spring Hills Dentistry 5.6 miles away on Newport, Dr. Irving Children's Dentistry 2.7 miles away on Culver, Dr. E University Park Dental 4.1 miles away on university.\n",
      "01:02:35 Speaker 3\n",
      "Well, she just gave me three options for different choices for dental care in my area. Even though I think my dentist is farther farther away but it's just good to read those options to.\n",
      "01:02:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. And I think if you asked her again, she could like to find more. She could umm, search, search for more. Yeah. Or if you, I think search for your dentist. She could probably tell you where that is too.\n",
      "01:03:05 Speaker 3\n",
      "All right. We will try to ask. Speaker 7. Can you? Look for Irvine dental.\n",
      "01:03:20 Speaker 7\n",
      "Found in Irvine Dental. Irvine Dental was 4.8 miles away.\n",
      "01:03:25 Speaker 3\n",
      "I just found it.\n",
      "01:03:29 Speaker 1\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "01:03:30 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, she just wrote me the address and. It just said it's currently closed because it actually stops at six and it says, well, it gave me the address and the suite where it's at so. I go there sometimes, like every couple months, so if I need to like check up or. I have a cavity. I don't like that, but it sends you to get it pulled. \n",
      "01:03:30 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, that makes sense. Well, that's great. And next time you go, maybe you can use Speaker 7 to help with the address and have the address\n",
      "01:03:30 Speaker 3\n",
      "Like sometimes, like, well, when my mom drives somewhere, I can just plug it into her like. She puts her little. Map thing and Google Maps and just type in the address and go.\n",
      "01:04:22 Speaker 1\n",

OK, well, I just want to let you all know that I will be able to send your homework and slides a little bit earlier this week because we figured out all the technology problems.

You got it, Speaker 10. You got it. OK, Speaker 2, you got it too.\n",
      "01:06:21 Speaker 8\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "01:06:25 Speaker 2\n",
      "Can I ask you a question? When is the last session?\n",
      "01:06:34 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah, that's a great question and thanks for asking. So we're on week 3 next week, Thursday, we will do week four. I believe. Laura, you're leading that one right. And the last session. So next week, next Thursday will be August 8th. And then the last session. Will be August 15th, the Thursday that Siona is going to lead, and that's the last actual session where you're going to learn from our PowerPoint train. OK, so after that we will schedule a time. It doesn't have to be like Thursday. It could be any time, but if you wanted to stay the same Thursday, which means it will be August 22nd the. So think week six if you go by numbers in your head. Week six, we would like to hear from you just. We will ask you some questions about how you feel about the program and then you can share with us everything you wanted to share, including just, you know how it works well or how it didn't work well. You can bring your caregivers too. So if you have people living in the home with you, you can all share together because. Chances are this may had some impact to your whole family. Maybe they love having it and they see some good improvements and benefits. Maybe they have ideas too. We want to hear from all of them, so feel feel free to bring them as well. And I will send you homework and your slide from today because I saw a lot of really good exercises and we'll see chatter next Thursday same time.\n",
      "01:08:17 Speaker 8\n",
      "OK.\n",

      "Any questions?\n",
      "01:08:20 Speaker 9\n",
      "Speaker 8, we were in the middle of changing his wake up word. So Speaker 8, if you still wanted to, you can just stick around for a little bit. We'll do it and then we'll let you go. I promise.\n",
      "01:08:32 Speaker 5\n",
      "And and if you have, if you are clinician, feel free to stay here so we can be brief real quick and it should take probably 5 minutes. Other than that, have a wonderful day and see you next Thursday. Bye.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.

      "Problem 1: Self-Care Difficulties\n",
      "Differential Diagnoses:\n",
      "- Arm weakness: This may be the result of neurological issues or muscular atrophy post-injury or illness. Considering R.T.'s history of seizures, the weakness could be due to a neurological cause.\n",
      "- Difficulty in controlling lotion application and hairstyling due to arm weakness, requiring adaptive strategies for better self-care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion: R.T. struggles with specific self-care tasks due to the weakness in her left arm. She finds it challenging to style her hair and manage the amount of lotion during application, often resulting in using excess amounts. Digital assistants, like Alexa, serve as an aid to set reminders for such tasks, providing a means to better manage time and self-care appointments. The condition seems to be stable but needs careful monitoring and possibly physical therapy to address muscular or neurological deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plan for Problem 1:\n",
      "- Encourage physical therapy exercises to improve strength in the left arm, possibly increasing scheduled sessions if needed.\n",
      "- Implement adaptive devices designed for self-care to facilitate ease in hairstyling and lotion application until significant strength is recovered.\n",
      "- Alexa will be utilized to set reminders for self-care tasks, focusing on proper timing and allocation of time for these tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem 2: Medication Management for Seizures\n",
      "Differential Diagnoses:\n",
      "- Stable seizure control with current medication, but potential for breakthrough seizures during medication transition.\n",
      "- Potential side effects or interaction issues when swapping one medication for another, especially as the dosages are adjusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion: R.T. is compliant with her anti-seizure medication regimen but is due to undergo a transition in her medication as advised by her neurologist. She practices taking medication twice daily, morning and night, which would continue during her shift to a new regimen. Accurate dosing and vigilance during this transition are vital to preventing seizure occurrences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plan for Problem 2:\n",
      "- Set up detailed medication reminders via Alexa and the smartphone; ensure these align with any changes directed by her neurologist. R.T. should use reminders for specific dosages, including transitional periods.\n",
      "- Monitor for adverse reactions and efficacy when phasing out the old medication for the new one.\n",
      "- Schedule a follow-up with neurology to discuss the progress post-transition and any modification needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem 3: Dietary Management\n",
      "Differential Diagnoses:\n",

      "00:17:08 Speaker 2\n",
      "Umm well, like before my accident. I am. I would like you know when you surf. I would get the little ones like down in Doheny or the little ways, like two or two feet like little ones. And just like, ride them to shore. It's really easy, but it's fun.\n",

Being in the water like she in the past, she would tell me to swim with her from tower to Tower. But like I'm just kind of I'm reintroduce myself to water cause like earlier this year at UM, some seizures, so when you go back in the waves do not want to have that happen. So, like need to reintroduce myself. That's why I'm in my community pool, doing some either treading water or trying to do some little half laps. So it's all in like working my head need to make it. Work.\n",

      "Because like well before PT, I need to have it in a bun or back cause like. One of the things well, I'm tall and also I got a lot of hair. So like sometimes my my PT, he’s like you need to tie that back.\n",

      "Client Summary: P4 had reported potential benefits to using Alexa including setting alarms and multimodal interaction task completion, “I set alarms and it's really the sound of her compared to my cell phone too. This is louder. So I come in my room and I’m on my computer working or doing something, I can hear that better. So it's like part of the reminder that way, so.”. Even though the multimodal interface offers increased volume when needed, the accuracy of speech recognition may require further investigation as P4’s device sometimes misinterpreted her command,  \"sometimes when I try to say a reminder at this time and I say well, how I pronounce it, maybe she does not understand like I want it 10:30 or 10:40, 10-40.\". When this occurred, P4 utilized Alexa’s tactile interface, allowing her to execute the task, “Then you can just like tap on the screen and do it. Then just scroll to the number she's touch like that. Not like speaking it because I'm really easy to me for you to touch and like tactile, it's easier for me than just talking.”. This led P4 to discuss potential design implications for the device that allowed for easier accessibility, “they have these little like widgets, her little buttons on top of it, they're kind of small and maybe like making bigger. Here's counter. Here's appointment. Here's a reminder. It'd be larger to like, you know, I'm a tactile person. If I can see it and touch it, if they're bigger, it'll be more of an improvement for me.”. Despite Alexa not recognizing P4’s commands consistently, she had learned to utilize alternative interfaces for seamless interaction with Alexa.\n",

M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.

      "Yeah. And I didn't have, I haven't. I don't really know how to use Speaker 4. And and I had to just now get it on my phone and so I had. I know I do not know any of this. To set up and that kinda stuff. So.\n",
      "00:03:15 Speaker 1\n",
      "Hey, that's what we're here for. And I think since you're using Apple, it shouldn't be a hard transition. I think you'll be OK, but again, we're here for any help and that's kind of what is all about so.\n",
      "00:03:26 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:03:27 Speaker 1\n",
      "So second question. When do you need to set up an alarm and a reminder? Oh, sorry. Yeah. So when do you need to set up an alarm or a reminder for an appointment?\n",
      "00:03:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "The well for the calendar that I use on both. Of my. Devices. They generally. Gives me. It gives like. Your 30 minute. Yeah. Yeah. So so it gives me. A. Usually 30 minutes, but it could. Be at any time but. And you know if. And. You know you can. Delete an event. And. Things like that. And so I think I do that pretty good.\n",
      "00:04:54 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. No, that's awesome. And So what? What type of appointments do you need to schedule or just keep up with?\n",
      "00:05:07 Speaker 2\n",
      "A lot of. Doctor appointments. Yeah. And haircuts?\n",
      "00:05:16 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:05:17 Speaker 2\n",
      "So. I play poker. Ok. And. In in those apps. The poker is an app and. Then we get. None. A Google meet and. So that so you and so that. That's what. I it's on my calendar and. Golf and. The Goa restaurants. I put it on there.\n",
      "00:06:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "00:06:20 Speaker 2\n",
      "And that's about all.\n",
      "00:06:21 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. Do you use? Do you use it for? Maybe things like reminding you to take medications at a certain time?\n",
      "00:06:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "I don't use it for that. Don't. I don't use anything, any medication other than a pill of allergies.\n",
      "00:06:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. OK.\n",
      "00:06:46 Speaker 2\n",
      "So. And I'm in a habit. When I'm going to bed, I pop a so so that.\n",
      "00:06:58 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. So you got a little routine down for yourself.\n",
      "00:07:00 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "00:07:02 Speaker 1\n",
      "No, that's great. OK. All right, so last question. Can you think of 10 scenarios to complete this sentence? I want to set a reminder a notification, a timer for.\n",
      "00:07:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "So I'm gonna have to write this because.\n",
      "00:07:23 Speaker 1\n",
      "Here. Oh, so I have it actually prepared. Let me.\n",
      "00:07:28 Speaker 2\n",
      "'Cause good because I I get 3 words into a sentence and then I forgot.\n",
      "00:07:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's completely OK.\n",
      "00:07:39 Speaker 2\n",
      "I want to OK.\n",
      "00:07:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "Is this OK?\n",
      "00:07:40 Speaker 2\n",
      "I want to set. Yeah. Perfect. Four, OK time. Timer reminder. Pretty fine.\n",
      "00:07:56 Speaker 1\n",
      "So you can.\n",
      "00:07:59 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. So. I do.\n",
      "00:08:08 Speaker 1\n",
      "Some of the OOP sorry. I. I was gonna say you can use some of the examples that you were talking about before as part of this so you don't have to come up with. Yeah, with an entirely new. Set of set of answers.\n",
      "00:08:25 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. So. Like I said, the events that, well, let's see. Yeah. OK. That I had been. Kind of set. But when I'm out in the yard and I need to. Water sprinklers and things then I say. Hmm. Siri. Give me. 20 minutes.\n",
      "00:09:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's awesome.\n",
      "00:09:15 Speaker 2\n",
      "None. Things like that. OR. Have the my phone is. See what I was going to say? But. Went out my. So mostly that.\n",
      "00:09:52 Speaker 1\n",
      "You maybe use a timer for like when you're cooking. Or anything like that.\n",
      "00:09:58 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, I do, but scarcely because. My wife is a good cook. But but but. Maybe once a week. I'll cook for her.\n",
      "00:10:22 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK. And then is that kind of when you would use a timer for like, OK, So what? Specifically, would you? Like a timer for or a reminder when you're cooking.\n",
      "00:10:39 Speaker 2\n",
      "Well, I make. Homemade ice cream.\n",
      "00:10:47 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "00:10:48 Speaker 2\n",
      "And so. I have you. I put it all. In and it goes around and around and around and so. I. No. When it gets. Salad, but it it's usually about 30 minutes and I go check on them.\n",
      "00:11:11 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:11:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "And sometimes. Probably. Other times. I say OK, I needed to. It's not 30 minutes, it's 40 minutes so. I then I time it that.\n",
      "00:11:43 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, awesome.\n",
      "00:11:44 Speaker 2\n",
      "So. And. I also. For. Washing. My wife usually. Washes the washing machine, but I can. Right. Take it. Take. The clothes out of the washing machine and put them in the dryer and. It's two or three different kinds of material, and so I can the dryer I use. For and and if it gets. You know it it. When it stopped. I. Iron thanks. You know, I said. Oh, it's. The set needs 10 minutes to get dry. So. OK. So. So that's what that's what I use.\n",
      "00:13:05 Speaker 1\n",
      "That's awesome. You use it for things that I didn't really think that I could use the timers and reminders for, so that's pretty cool. Yeah, I would have never thought to put a timer for the sprinklers in the front yard for the grass. That's pretty. It's a pretty cool idea I might. I might just take that. OK. Awesome. So can you think of maybe anything else? Maybe some things that you may need, like a notification for or. Maybe some things that you do for Siri that you would want to transition over, or maybe. Implement. For Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:13:54 Speaker 2\n",
      "Well, I I have. I haven't ever used it. And when you when I get mine. I will find some uses. You know.\n",
      "00:14:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "00:14:11 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:14:41 Speaker 1\n",
      "I think that's. We're gonna we have a little music section. In the upcoming. So I think you'll enjoy. And Recipes Section 2. I think it might. I think the recipe section is the last week, so I'm glad to to see that a lot of the things that you said were kinda gonna be discussing. So I think you'll be. You'll have fun with.\n",
      "00:15:01 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, I'm gonna. I can. I'm sure I can. Make it useful.\n",
      "00:15:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. We're excited to kind of show you and help you along the way and you know, just have some fun with it. Think it'll be it'll be a good time.\n",

      "00:15:42 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, I I had to have a question, Speaker 2. Yeah. When you set your calendars, do you do by yourself or does somebody help you with that?\n",
      "00:15:56 Speaker 2\n",
      "I I do it by myself. Sometimes I get it in the. For 95% I I did it. And then. So. The. The calendar that we use. My wife, Ann may, we are all on the same calendar. And we babysit. And so. You know there's in different colors, so we know when we're gonna be babysitting. And going to stores and going to all those things I've been telling you, but. None. Speaker 3, what was the question?\n",
      "00:17:13 Speaker 3\n",
      "That was there, you answered it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, OK. Yeah.\n",
      "00:17:19 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, you answered it.\n",
      "00:17:20 Speaker 3\n",
      "I just wanted to see if you were able to do it like independently or if somebody helped you with those reminders.\n",
      "00:17:26 Speaker 2\n",
      "Well, you know. I'm. A. I think I'm getting worse. You know I'm going uh. You know, I I suspect I'll need help. Now. My wife could help me, but I guess I could use the Speaker 4. For some things.\n",
      "00:18:11 Speaker 3\n",
      "Yeah, for sure I can use some help myself.\n",
      "00:18:16 Speaker 2\n",
      "So. So you're probably good with Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:18:21 Speaker 3\n",
      "Not at. I I just installed it before this meeting. Not at all. Try.\n",
      "00:18:26 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:18:33 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh, it's it's all a learning process here, especially with technology rapidly, you know, advancing. You know, we can't really keep up with what you know, we can do what we can't. So I think it's great to great to kind of, you know once in a while get get like a little lesson on you know what there is out there and how. Technology can help us. Yeah.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.

His self-reported decline in cognitive abilities necessitates interventions aimed at technological adaptation to maintain independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Daily Activity Management**:\n",
      "   - F.W. exhibits the ability to independently manage daily tasks, such as setting reminders for personal appointments and using Siri for operational tasks like setting timers. He maintains a structured routine for medication (allergy pill), embedded into his nightly rituals, thereby minimizing the necessity for external reminders for this aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Social Engagement and Routine Activities**:\n",
      "   - Active engagement in social activities indicates a stable routine, though shared responsibilities with his spouse highlights family support in personal activity management. His concern for potential cognitive decline suggests a future need for monitoring and possible intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Technology Training and Support**:\n",
      "   - Recommend initiating targeted training sessions focused on integrating Alexa into F.W.'s existing technological routine. This includes tutorials on setting reminders and alarms through voice commands, use in cooking assistance for timers, and transitioning Siri functions to Alexa.\n",
      "   - Schedule follow-up sessions to assess progress and address any additional support required to enhance F.W.’s comfort and familiarity with Alexa's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cognitive Maintenance Strategies**:\n",
      "   - Encourage continued use of structured routines to support cognitive stability. Provide educational resources focusing on cognitive exercises, possibly integrating with Alexa's interactive features.\n",
      "\n",

      "Yeah. Oh, there we go. Cool. OK. OK. And I also noticed for the volume up volume down, there's also a physical button too, if you prefer physically pressing the button. You can also ask Speaker 4 to put the volume up or down.\n",
      "00:01:30 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:01:32 Speaker 1\n",

      "00:01:40 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:01:40 Speaker 1\n",
      "So yeah, if you don't like Despicable Me. If you like something else. It could. We could just replace.\n",
      "00:01:47 Speaker 2\n",
      "So OK, so. Should I? I mean. The volume. This on my Speaker 4. Is that is mine. See is it coming out from yours or mine?\n",
      "00:02:27 Speaker 1\n",
      "I don't have my. I think it's called from yours.\n",
      "00:02:31 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. So Speaker 4, play trailer for Despicable Me 4.\n",
      "00:02:43 Speaker 1\n",

      "Yeah. Now we can try this.\n",
      "00:02:52 Speaker 2\n",
      "So. What's good, Speaker 4? Volume up two times. There you go, Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:03:04 Speaker 1\n",
      "Good job.\n",
      "00:03:06 Speaker 2\n",
      "Volume down 2 times. OK.\n",
      "00:03:11 Speaker 5\n",
      "Good. You’re getting the hang of it.\n",
      "00:03:13 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah, you're a fast learner.\n",
      "00:03:17 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 4, pause the video. It stopped Speaker 4 play the video.\n",
      "00:03:30 Speaker 4\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "00:03:35 Speaker 2\n",

      "OK. Mine went on to something else. I wonder why.\n",
      "00:03:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "What did it?\n",
      "00:03:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 4, go back to. Despicable Me 4. Well. It didn't. It didn't say anything, OK?\n",
      "00:04:18 Speaker 1\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "00:04:19 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 4. Play the trailer for Despicable Me 4. There it goes, OK. Speaker 4, pause the video. Speaker 4, play the video. It's not they they they didn't. Oh, play the video. Speaker 4. Is there something? See, this is when I say play the video instead of pause. This is what's on my.\n",
      "00:05:19 Speaker 5\n",
      "So maybe instead of saying play the video, we can try to replace the word with resume.\n",
      "00:05:27 Speaker 2\n",
      "Resume OK.\n",
      "00:05:29 Speaker 5\n",
      "You can try that and see. Sometimes there's some glitches here and there. So we just kind of gotta play with play with the wording.\n",
      "00:05:39 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK so. Speaker 4. Wait a minute. Could you go?\n",
      "00:05:49 Speaker 4\n",

      "00:06:34 Speaker 6\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "00:06:36 Speaker 3\n",
      "And having our sentences well, like paced. So I sent Ziona some information. If she want to help you set it up. Actually making Speaker 4 to talk slower because I think you are trying really hard to keep up with him, so feel free to play with that or read the information, yeah.\n",
      "00:06:58 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:07:03 Speaker 1\n",

      "00:10:55 Speaker 1\n",
      "Awesome. Awesome. Do you wanna practice? Maybe having her play music? Or do you wanna practice again with, like a different video?\n",
      "00:11:04 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. No, I I let's do music.\n",
      "00:11:13 Speaker 1\n",

      "00:12:46 Speaker 4\n",
      "Are there any candidates?\n",
      "00:12:48 Speaker 2\n",

      "00:12:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you have Amazon Music?\n",
      "00:12:51 Speaker 2\n",
      "Uh. My wife has. Yeah. That Amazon Music.\n",
      "00:13:09 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, 'cause, I think it connects. Automatically to that, so that would have to be something to.\n",
      "00:13:17 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah. Oh, but it doesn't do it with. Oh, that's Neil Diamond. OK so. Can do.\n",

      "00:14:18 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:14:20 Speaker 1\n",
      "OK, I see you see it's because we can help you, like set it up. 'cause. I know we're running out of time next week, but it's because. It links to Amazon Music, which is a specific app to listen to music.\n",
      "00:14:34 Speaker 2\n",
      "Right. OK, alright.\n",
      "00:14:36 Speaker 1\n",
      "But we. Yeah, but we can practice. Maybe asking Speaker 4 for a different. Movie.\n",
      "00:14:41 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:14:42 Speaker 6\n",
      "Maybe you can look up the music like the lyrics on YouTube. On Speaker 4. I don't know if that'll do that.\n",
      "00:14:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "Oh yeah, it's a good idea.\n",
      "00:14:52 Speaker 3\n",
      "Videos see maybe you can call YouTube. Frank, I have a. Do you watch these music videos on your phone or on the computer often? You normally are more radio person. 'Cause, we're showing all these new technology at you. So I'm trying to make sure you are familiar with some of these things and you're comfortable using them.\n",
      "00:15:15 Speaker 2\n",
      "Well, I.\n",
      "00:15:20 Speaker 4\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "00:15:21 Speaker 2\n",
      "I usually don't play. On the. Music. But. I like to play well, my son. Speaker 4. Stop. There go.\n",
      "00:16:00 Speaker 3\n",
      "Eddie, I shut up.\n",
      "00:16:02 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, really. Yeah. So when we bought my cards. My son has about 15. 1000. Records. And. We play dominoes and so he is. The he gets the. Music. And Spotify? So I don't know that that probably won't won't work right.\n",
      "00:16:46 Speaker 3\n",
      "We can stream Spotify. And connect it to your Speaker 4 'cause I do that all the time.\n",
      "00:16:52 Speaker 2\n",
      "Cool.\n",
      "00:16:53 Speaker 3\n",
      "Except I don't know if you like his genre of music so. You make music. His genre of music, but I just wanna show you. It does allow you to play a specific genre. Like if you call Speaker 4, play smooth jazz, it will play just some random. Like you know, or you can say like pop songs. It'll play just so you can have it in the background. It doesn't hurt to try, it's pretty easy. So you don't have to shuffle because I know normally you will have to do a lot of shuffling and looking and reading. Which may be challenging for you. Yeah, just some ideas to play with. So spend some time talking to it. And it does frustrate you and leave it alone for a second. Back and you won't break it. It's it's artificial intelligence, so it's very patient, but sometimes very dumb so.\n",
      "00:17:49 Speaker 2\n",
      "Alright. Well, that's good.\n",
      "00:17:52 Speaker 3\n",
      "Play with it, mess it, mess it up. Totally fine, yeah.\n",
      "00:17:55 Speaker 2\n",
      "All right. Well, I'm getting. Some some progress I guess.\n",
      "00:18:03 Speaker 3\n",
      "You. You're making great progress. OK, I'm gonna close all the rooms. I know other people are still doing. You need more time. Oh, do you get to try the? Do you need extra time to maybe set up like? Google or Apple Calendar we can we can give you more time here in this room. Don't have to go back to the main room if you needed more time.\n",
      "00:18:30 Speaker 5\n",
      "I think we wanted to see if we could set up the speaking rate for Speaker 4.\n",
      "00:18:36 Speaker 3\n",
      "Let's do that.\n",
      "00:18:37 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah. So we can do that and then we can head to the to the main room.\n",
      "00:18:42 Speaker 3\n",
      "OK, sounds good. Take your time.\n",
      "00:18:44 Speaker 1\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "00:18:45 Speaker 3\n",
      "Nice work. We're so proud of your progress.\n",
      "00:18:49 Speaker 1\n",
      "You're doing great.\n",
      "00:18:50 Speaker 2\n",
      "I don't feel so good, but. I'm getting better.\n",
      "00:18:55 Speaker 3\n",
      "You are getting. It forces you to first of all be articulate with your words like the Despicable Me is hard. English is my second. That's not a easy word for me. And also you have to really pace your rate of speech 'cause it does get very. It cuts you off in the middle, so a good exercise is like how we were putting the words in front of the screen. So think about what you wanna say and then just execute it. Will also help you just communicate. General people work, yeah.\n",
      "00:19:28 Speaker 2\n",
      "All right, I'll try, man.\n",
      "00:19:36 Speaker 5\n",
      "All righty. So.\n",
      "00:19:38 Speaker 2\n",
      "What? What were we gonna do?\n",
      "00:19:41 Speaker 5\n",
      "So we were gonna try to see if we could slow. Speaker 4's speaking. Speaking rate. So we're just gonna try it out and see if you feel comfortable with it. If it's speaking too slow, then we can go back. If it's still kind of speaking too fast. If you feel like you kinda have to try to play catch up with Speaker 4, we can. As needed.\n",
      "00:20:11 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "00:20:12 Speaker 5\n",
      "So it's a pretty simple. Fix all we have to do is just ask it to speak slower. So all that build up just to say a simple command, but.\n",
      "00:20:39 Speaker 2\n",
      "So what am I supposed to do? Just say that.\n",
      "00:20:43 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yes, so.\n",
      "00:20:46 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 4, speak slower.\n",
      "00:20:50 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK, I will speak at this speed.\n",
      "00:20:52 Speaker 4\n",
      "From now on.\n",
      "00:20:54 Speaker 2\n",
      "That's that's good.\n",
      "00:20:57 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah. Is that still a little fast for your preference? Is that just right?\n",
      "00:21:04 Speaker 2\n",
      "I think it's pretty. Let's let me do it again.\n",
      "00:21:08 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:21:09 Speaker 2\n",
      "Speaker 4 speak. Slower.\n",
      "00:21:14 Speaker 4\n",
      "OK, I will speak.\n",
      "00:21:16 Speaker 4\n",
      "I will speak from now on.\n",
      "00:21:19 Speaker 2\n",
      "OK. I'll try that and it's too slow. I'll speak.\n",
      "00:21:25 Speaker 5\n",
      "Yeah, you can ask to speak. Faster. OK, so from now on it's going to speak at that. So if you want, we can try maybe a command and see if. Maybe we can try to see if we can play a trailer for maybe not. We can maybe try. A different movie title that you've been wanting to see.\n",
      "00:22:05 Speaker 2\n",
      "What movie? Ted lasso.\n",
      "00:22:18 Speaker 5\n",
      "Ted Lasso, OK. Can ask. You can ask Speaker 4 to play the trailer for that movie and see if you like the rate that. That it speaks to you.\n",
      "00:22:32 Speaker 2\n",
      "Oh, OK, Speaker 4. But. I have. OK. I've got a I've got OK Speaker 4. Want to. Play. Ted lasso.\n",
      "00:22:58 Speaker 4\n",
      "To watch the video, right?\n",
      "00:23:00 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yes. And I want you to play Ted Lasso.\n",
      "00:23:05 Speaker 4\n",
      "I can't find the video Ted Lasso.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

So we essentially, Speaker 5 is kind of similar to to Siri where we just kinda wanna keep all of our commands short and sweet. So kind of like how you said that you do the same with Siri. Kinda wanna translate that over to Speaker 5 and it's gonna take some practice, but you already got the hang of it, so you'll be fine.\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.

That's not really a good calendar because that calendar. Has. The date when it you know it. Yeah it. Shows when do you want to stop? When did? So that's what a a calendar is. And the and the.

      "Speaker 4, stop. OK, Speaker 4, how do I do my laundry? Well. They said according to if you need. Do he has a paragraph that says? If you need to do laundry, separate your clothes according to the type of fabric, then buy color once. You're gathering enough clothes to wash, place them in the washing machine. Along with the detergent. Select the appropriate load on the fabric type, such as a gentle wash for delicate fabrics or hot water cycle for dirty. Very dirty clothes. That's how you do it.\n",

      "I think this is a great tool to. To just maybe get started or maybe even teach other people how to do their laundry. Maybe if people are more. Auditory listeners or visual learners. I think Speaker 4 does a really good job at quite literally giving you step by step on how to do. So we kind of just wanted to show you everything that Speaker 4 can do because honestly, even before this, I was like, Oh my gosh, that's such a good idea. Can definitely ask Speaker 4 to do all these little things that I didn't really think.\n",

      "Right, right.\n",
      "00:13:00 Speaker 3\n",

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \n",

      "00:07:04 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, I guess. I'm too tired.\n",
      "00:07:10 Speaker 1\n",
      "Next question, Speaker 2 is what type of self-care or health related needs do you have difficulties?\n",
      "00:07:30 Speaker 2\n",
      "Say that again.\n",
      "00:07:33 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. Do you have any difficulties with self-care? Believe you said you didn't, but I just. Make sure.\n",
      "00:07:39 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. I mean, I shave every. Every. Morning. Like you say. I always shower and because I go out and in the weather and I go and do a lot of gardening. And it's when. 85°. I have to put. You can't go out there and not get sweaty so.\n",
      "00:08:24 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "00:08:26 Speaker 2\n",

      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "00:08:39 Speaker 1\n",
      "Do you usually need help with that, or do you use any any technology to help you remind you to do these things?\n",
      "00:08:58 Speaker 2\n",
      "Well. If I had a pill I needed to do. From a doctor. They know my. Prescription. For my Walgreens, let's say. And. I just. And they send it. The prescription to Walgreens and they called me actually because when it's so, but I don't I haven't had. A prescription. Yet this year? Yeah.\n",
      "00:09:49 Speaker 1\n",

There's one or two or three, but I didn't get 1 yet.\n",
      "00:11:32 Speaker 1\n",
      "Yeah. Thank you for the example. So when you get injured you you remember, you remember to go to the doctor, right?\n",
      "00:11:39 Speaker 2\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "00:11:40 Speaker 1\n",

The calendar. At the top. And. I can't find out. How to do that? Split screen. It's just the left side of the screen. If you look at. There that. That would help me.\n",

And. Add on a day or whatever and then that would go. I'm I'm sure on the left side in a list. So I don't know. I'm I'm trying to find out how to do that but I didn't know if any of you.

      "OK. Yes, I'm looking back at the point and they're basically the left side is like A1 command and then the right side is a different command. So for example, they're like 2 examples, like one could be Alexa. Me to. Blank and then Alexa, delete that reminder. So it's kind of like showing your.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.

      "Ensure the SOAP note includes all relevant details from the conversation while adhering to the structure and style of the provided demo: SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa.

      "\n",
      "1. **Articulation error**: The patient mentioned experiencing difficulty with speech recognition, which implies that there might have been instances where the patient mispronounced words or phrases, leading to issues with Alexa understanding the commands. This is supported by the statement, \"I have gone downhill precipitously in my speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alexa error**: The patient experienced difficulty with speech recognition, which discouraged her from using the device more consistently. This suggests that there were instances where the verbal commands were clear, but Alexa did not respond correctly due to speech recognition errors.\n",

      "3. **Other (@Review_Communication Breakdown)**: The patient referred to learning how to change her wake-up word from “Speaker 4” to “Ziggy” because it was more feasible for her to articulate.

      "Based on the provided conversation summary and the categories of communication breakdown, the following instances of communication breakdown can be identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Articulation error**: The patient mentioned experiencing difficulty with speech recognition, which implies that there might have been instances where the patient mispronounced words or phrases, leading to issues with Alexa understanding the commands. This is supported by the statement, \"I have gone downhill precipitously in my speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alexa error**: The patient experienced difficulty with speech recognition, which discouraged her from using the device more consistently. This suggests that there were instances where the verbal commands were clear, but Alexa did not respond correctly due to speech recognition errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Other (@Review_Communication Breakdown)**: The patient referred to learning how to change her wake-up word from “Speaker 4” to “Ziggy” because it was more feasible for her to articulate. This indicates a potential issue with the wake-up command, which is not explicitly covered by the other categories.\n",

      "These are the identified communication breakdowns based on the conversation summary provided.\n",
      "Based on the provided summary of the conversation, there is one instance of communication breakdown that can be identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lack of Auditory Description**: The conversation mentions a challenge with Speaker 4 (Alexa) not providing auditory descriptions when displaying choices on the screen. This issue highlights a gap in accessibility for blind users, as they rely on auditory feedback to interact with the device. This situation does not fit into any of the predefined categories such as No response, Articulation error, Semantic error, Syntactic error, Timing error, or Alexa error. Therefore, it falls under the category of **@Review_Communication Breakdown** due to the lack of auditory feedback for visually impaired users.\n",
      "\n",
      "No other specific instances of communication breakdown between the patient and Alexa are mentioned in the summary.\n",
      "Based on the provided conversation transcript and the guidelines for identifying communication breakdowns, the following instances can be classified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Articulation error**: The patient mentions, \"sometimes when I try to say a reminder at this time and I say well, how I pronounce it, maybe she does not understand like I want it 10:30 or 10:40, 10-40.\" This indicates a potential mispronunciation issue where Alexa does not understand the intended time due to how the patient pronounces it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alexa error**: The patient states, \"the accuracy of speech recognition may require further investigation as P4’s device sometimes misinterpreted her command.\" This suggests that the verbal commands from the patient were clear, but Alexa did not respond correctly due to a speech recognition error.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the identified communication breakdowns within the conversation between the patient and Alexa.\n",
      "I'm sorry, but I cannot access or analyze audio files directly. However, if you provide a transcript of the conversation between the patient and Alexa, I can help identify any communication breakdowns based on the categories provided.\n",
      "Based on the provided transcript, there are no direct or indirect conversations between the patient (Speaker 2) and Alexa (Speaker 4) that fit the categories of communication breakdown as described. The conversation primarily involves the clinician and the patient discussing the patient's use of technology and potential uses for Alexa, but there are no instances of actual interaction with Alexa that result in a communication breakdown.

       "[\"SOAP  Notes  #1:  M.A.  Week  1  (30-40  minutes)  Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI causing blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. M.A. was pleasant and cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. The mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.  Objective  (O):   User  needs  assessment:  Interview  style  Q  and  A  to  know  about  the  participant’s  needs related to scheduling and reminders was completed.  -  Technology  used  for  scheduling  and  reminders:  Siri  on  iWatch  and  iPhone.  Mother helps with scheduling appointments -  Caregiver  dependent  for  setting  up  appointments  and  reminders   -  Needs  reminders  for  regular  therapy  appointments  at  BRAIN  and  Loma  Linda.  Also needs reminders to set up or schedule medical/dental appointments   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  scheduling  and  reminders:   1)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  am  every  day   2)  I  want  to  set  up  an  alarm  for  taking  medications  at  7.45  pm  every  day   3)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  mom's  birthday  for  August  25th,  2024.   4)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  pop's  birthday  for  September  14th.   5)  I  want  to  set  up  a  reminder  for  my  neurology  appointment  on  July  24th,  2024  at  10  am.  6)  I  want  to  set  an  alarm  for  6.30  am  on  Mondays.   7)  I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment  on  August  5th  at  9  am.   8)  I  want  to  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes.   9)  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  VAT  training  for  every  thursday  at  5.30  pm.   Group  Training/Alexa  command  practice:    The  participant  practised  3  voice  commands  related  to  scheduling  and  reminders  topic. These commands included: 1) starting timer for 20 sec, 2) stopping timer and 3) setting up a reminder to play video games. M.A followed the verbal modeling provided by the clinician. For command 1, MA was able to execute the command: “Start timer for 20 sec” in 1 out of 3 attempts needing verbal cueing to increase the loudness of his voice to accurately execute this voice command. He was able to execute the command “stop timer” in the first attempt needing no cues or prompting. For command 3, MA was able to set the reminder in 1 out of 2 attempts using the utterances like “Can you remind me to play video games?” and “ Do you want to remind me to play video games?”  He needs verbal prompts to increase the loudness.  He  also  did  not  provide  details  related  to  time  and  day  for  the  reminder  having Alexa ask follow up questions for those details.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Max verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness clubbed with his TBI. MA had not received his Echo Show device during this session and used the Alexa app on his iPad and sometimes also needed to use the presenting clinician’s device to execute the commands.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  receive  the  device  soon  which  will  enable  him  to  possibly  be more independent with certain tasks involving Alexa. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:   Alarms   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  an  alarm  for  medications  at  7.45  am  everyday”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  set  an  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  cancel  the  Alarm  for  6.30  am  on  mondays”  /  “Alexa  cancel  the  alarm (* Alexa will ask follow up questions if there are more than one alarms)  Task  2:  Reminders   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  reminder  for  an  neurology  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  the  date  and  time   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  play  video  games”  *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time   Command  3:  “Alexa  cancel  the  reminder  for  video  games”    Command  4:  “Alexa,  I  want  to  set  a  reminder  for  mom’s  birthday  on  Aug  25”   Open  task:  Set  2  reminders  for  task  of  your  choice.   Task  3:  Appointments   Command  1:  “I  want  to  set  up  a  neurosurgery  appointment”   *Alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions.   Task  4:  Timers   Command  1:  “Alexa,  set  a  timer  for  2  minutes”    \",\n",
       " \"SOAP  Notes  #2:  M.A.  Week  2  (30-40  minutes)   Subjective  (S):   The  participant  attended  the  virtual  session  with  his  mother.  M.A.’s  parents  are  his  primary caregivers who have been helping with his ADLs since his TBI caused blindness along with cognitive communication deficits. The participant was engaged, and eager to participate in the session. HIs mother had assisted him with setting up the Amazon Echo device by helping him mute/un-mute the device as needed during the session, expanding his responses to follow questions about his experience with Alexa, and prompting him to repeat a command if Alexa did not pick up his command on the first try.  Objective  (O):   Review  of  week  1  content:  Had  M.A.  practice  one  command  to  schedule  appointments for an upcoming event.  -  Practiced:  I  want  to  set  an  appointment  for  class  at  5:45  pm  today.  I  want  to  set a reminder for the beach tomorrow at 9:30am. -  His  mother  had  mentioned  that  M.A.  had  set  a  timer  and  shut  off  his  timer  independently prior to this session. -  M.A.  was  asked  a  follow  up  question  on  whether  he  was  able  to  execute  commands from week 1 independently- he responded “I’m pretty happy”.  Introduction  to  week  2  content:  M.A.  was  asked  what  kind  of  leisure  activities  he  engaged in, how these activities were made accessible to him, and what other technology tools he used to engage in activities. -  M.A.  had  mentioned  listening  to  updates  on  ice  hockey  and  playing  video  games -  When  asked  if  he  listened  to  updates  or  had  someone  sitting  next  to  him  sharing details of the event, M.A. said that there would be someone sitting next to him sharing details of the event. -  M.A.’s  mother  had  mentioned  that  when  they  go  to  the  movies,  M.A.  will wear headphones that provide verbal captions that describe the visual scene of the movie -  M.A.  also  mentioned  that  he  plays  an  auditory  game  called  “Shadow  of  Veil”  that he plays on his Xbox that was specifically made for blind users -  M.A.  's  mother  mentioned  other  auditory  games  that  were  found  on  Alexa including song quizzes, “who wants to be a millionaire?” and “deal or no deal”. -  Expressed  wanting  more  cognitive  activities  on  Alexa  including  like  luminosity -  Technology  tools  used:  TV,  phone,  ipad,  Xbox  -  Music  listened  to:  Nipsey  Hustle  and  Kendrick  Lamar   Scenarios  using  Alexa  for  the  purpose  of  entertainment:  1)  I  want  to  ask  Alexa  about  the  channel  ice  hockey  is  on  so  that  I  can  watch  the  game 2)  I  want  to  listen  to  music  from  particular  artists  so  that  I  can  enjoy  the  songs  I  like  3)  I  want  to  play  games  using  auditory  stimuli  and  feedback  so  that  I  can  engage  in  activity/video games  4)  I  want  to  listen  to  a  Netflix  series  so  that  I  can  enjoy  the  shows  I  like     Alexa  command  practice:    M.A.  practiced  10  voice  commands  related  to  entertainment  topic.  These  commands  included: 1) telling an interesting science fact, 2) looking for Despicable Me 4 trailer, 3) playing the trailer, 4) telling a joke, 5) finding Nipsey Hustle clean song, 6) playing “livin’ on a prayer” by Bon Jovi, 7) playing “sweet caroline”, 8) fastwording 10 seconds, 9) increasing volume three times, decreasing volume two times, and 10) playing song from the beginning. For the first command, M.A. executed command in 1/2 opportunities given moderate verbal cues from clinician and mother. When asking for a Despicable 4 movie trailer, Alexa provided M.A. with visual options but did not read aloud options which posed a challenge for M.A.. Other challenges that were encountered included limitations in playing certain songs as the device required a monthly Amazon Music subscription. Even though M.A. mother provided M.A. With a verbal model of command to play the first two songs, Alexa did not play them. Instead, M.A. was prompted to play “sweet caroline” which did not require a subscription. In addition to limited songs, some music functions such as “fast forwarding”. M.A. did execute this command in 1/1 opportunities but Alexa could not perform this command. M.A. finished his session by practicing other functions such as increasing a decreasing volume. He was prompted to provide a specific number (e.g. increase times three) in order to provide Alexa with a range.   Assessment  (A):   User  Needs  Assessment:  The  participant  and  his  mother  both  contributed  to  the  responses. M.A’s mother elaborated on his responses and guided him in completing the scenario question. Maximum verbal cues and scaffolding was provided to the participant to participate in this assessment.  Training:   The  participant  was  able  to  execute  the  commands  after  verbal  modelling.  Verbal  modelling is crucial for MA because he is unable to read to the commands on the screen/presentation. The participant also used different sentence structure and words than the command that was modelled to complete the task related to the reminder. This indicates the participant is able to formulate novel utterances yet able to fulfil the desired outcome from Alexa.   Caregiver  assistance  and  scaffolding  remains  crucial  for  this  participant  considering  blindness coupled with his TBI. M.A.’s mother had also mentioned assistive tools such as audio captioning as well as offered design insights in regards to how Alexa could be accessible for blind users.   Plan  (P):   The  participant  expected  to  practice  learned  content  from  week  2  and  prepare  any  thoughts or insights for the next week. M.A and his mother continue to be motivated to participate in the training.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  entertainment.  Please  practice  these five commands with your Alexa. Record each command you practice and then submit it to researchers  Task  1:  Playing  Music  1.  “Alexa,  play  Kendrick  Lamar”  2.  “Alexa,  play  Nipsey  Hustle”   Task  2:  Playing  Videos  3.  “Alexa,  play  clip  from  Ice  Hockey  game”   Task  3:  Playing  Games  4.  “Alexa,  play  Are  you  smarter  than  a  fourth  grader”   Controlling  Video  and  Music  Functions  5.  “Alexa,  increase/decrease  volume”  6.  “Alexa,  play  next”  \",\n",
       " \"Subjective  (S):    M.A.  logged  onto  the  session  on  time  and  was  accompanied  by  mom.  He  was  prompted  by  mom throughout the session when Alexa didn't pick up command.M.A. was cooperative with the interview questions for the user needs assessment and willing to participate in the tasks for training session. His mother elaborated on M.A’s responses to provide more details for each of the interview questions.   Objective  (O):    Review  of  week  2  content  related  to  entertainment  was  completed  first.  M.A.  was  asked  to  play any music or video of his choice using his Echo device.  Practiced  commands:  “Alexa,  play  a  video  from  January  3rd.”  accurately  in  1/1  attempts.   -  His  mother  mentioned  syncing  his  Apple  music  account  to  the  Amazon  Echo  Device/Alexa account which made it possible for Alexa to access the content from his phone and in turn, was able to play a video from a specific date.  -  He  also  practiced  a  command  to  stop  the  video  or  music  (“Alexa,  Stop”)   that  was  playing in 1 out of 2 attempts needing mod cueing to unmute the device before executing this command.  His  mother  mentioned  that  MA  has  been  able  to  use  Alexa  for  playing  Bon  Jovi  songs  that  he likes to listen. His mother asked questions related to syncing a radio station to his Echo device and similarly was also interested in using the BARD library for blind app on his Echo device to improve his accessibility to the entertainment/books without assistance from his caregivers.   User  Needs  Assessment:   Interview  style  Q  and  A  completed  to  learn  about  the  participant’s  needs  related  to  self  care  and medical needs.  -  MA  needs  assistance  with  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  such  as  washing  hair,  brushing teeth, trimming nails and eating breakfast -  He  depends  entirely  on  his  parents  for  all  self  care  and  medical  needs  except  for  sometimes setting reminders for various needs  Scenarios  for  using  Alexa  for  self-care  and  medical  needs:   Dosage  of  medication,  reminder  to  refill/reorder  medication,  reminders  to  have  breakfast  on  certain time, brushing teeth at a certain time, reading the medication list for morning routine/evening, checking off the medications that have been taken for that particular day.  MA  was  introduced  to  tactically  feel  the  button  for  mute  and  unmute  on  top  of  the  Echo  device for him to be able to improve his ability to use the device more independently.   Command  training/practice:   MA  practiced  17  commands  related  to  self-care  and  medical  needs.  He  executed  verbal  commands for creating a medication list, adding a medication (tylenol) to the created list, read the medication list back  (“Alexa, read me my medication list”), reminder for taking a specific medication (depocope) at a given time (“Alexa, remind me to take decocope tomorrow at 7.30 am”), reminder for doing laundry, steps on how to do the laundry in 1/1 attempts  using  the  verbal  prompts  and  modeling  provided  by  the  clinician  and  his  mother  both. He was also able to ask questions including where he could find tylenol, how to get stains out clothes, how to use a fabric softener, how to treat a migraine, what to take for stomach ache, and asking on how to find a physical therapist.    Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:   With  the  Q  and  A  style  interview  questions,  the  participant  continues  to  need  mod  to  max  cueing and scaffolding from his mother and clinicians to participate and elaborate on his subjective responses. For self care and medical needs, the participant is caregiver dependent and the use of Alexa would assist the participant in being independent with reminders for medications, asking questions regarding tasks related to this topic  The  participant  continued  to  demonstrate  progress  with  his  ability  to  execute  the  commands  this week given min to mod verbal prompting and cueing to be a louder and over articulate to ensure the ASR would recognize the command Given  MA  that  is  blind,  the  command  related  to  steps  or  instructions  to  do  laundry  was  the  one that was the most challenging. The Echo Show presented the written steps or instructions to complete laundry on the screen; however it wouldn’t provide verbal output for the same. This required the clinician and his mother to prompt MA to execute different reworded commands to determine that the device was reading one step at a time to complete this task (laundry). The command that produced the desired results was “Alexa, read me the instructions to do laundry one step at a time”. Although, this command still yielded verbal output of all the steps at once instead of proving one step at a time. With the command “what do I take for stomach pain?”, the command was not processed and needed to be reworded to “stomach ache”   Plan  (P):   Participant  encouraged  to  talk  slower  and  over  articulate  with  complex  words  like  names  of  the medications etc to improve the ASR of the system. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.    Home  exercise  program:    Task  1:  Medications  (dosage,  reminders,  creating  medication  lists-adding,  deleting,  reading to the medication list)  Command  1:  “Alexa,  what  dosage  of  tylenol  can  I  take  at  once”   Command  2:  “Alexa,  remind  me  to  refill  my  prescription  for  depakote”  *alexa  will  ask  follow  up  questions  re:  date  and  time.

       " \"Subjective  (S):   M.A.  logged  onto  his  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  M.A.  required  moderate  verbal cues (e.g. asking follow up questions) and intermittent redirection by his mother and the clinician while executing voice commands. His mother helped M.A. in expanding his responses to questions asked by the clinician.  Objective  (O):   M.A.  spent  the  beginning  of  the  session  going  over  commands  from  week  3.  Some  of  the  commands included: -  “Hey  Alexa,  can  you  add  Trazodone  to  my  medicine  list?”  -  Added  medication  to  list  after  Alexa  asked  if  he  wanted  “Trazadone”  on  his  list  Once  he  finished  practicing  commands  from  week  3,  he  was  introduced  to  this  week’s  commands which included commands for news and facts. The clinician went over commands M.A. will practice by asking him questions of what he would use them for (e.g. “Is there a fact you would like to know?”) M.A. practice the following commands: -  “Hey  Alexa,  How  many  medals  has  Russia  won?”  -  “ Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature?”  -  “Hey,  Alexa,  what's  the  temperature  in  North  Carolina?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  Can  you  start  the  flax,  the  flash  debriefing?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  stop”  -  “Hey,  Alexa,  what's  on  my  calendar?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  Tomorrow  at  2:00  PM  can  you  create  an  appointment  for  me?”  -  “For  the  gym”  -  “Hey,  Alexa,  who's  running  for  president?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  where  is  Nairobi?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  stop”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  what's  interesting  now  in  Kenya?”  -  “Hey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like?”  -  “Alexa,  what's  the  traffic  like  going  to  Cypress,  CA?”  -  “Hey,  Alexa,  what's  traffic  like  to  EJ  Marshall  Elementary?”  -  “Hey,  Alexa,  is  acupuncture  a  good  thing  for  me?”  -  “Hey  Alexa,  What  is  the  history  of  the  Olympic  Games?”   M.A.  practiced  commands  related  to  news  and  facts,  setting  an  appointment,  and  searching  for traffic information.  Assessment  (A):   During  his  user  needs  assessment,  M.A.  required  a  lot  of  verbal  prompting  from  his  mother  when asked to give examples about using commands from week 3. For instance, when asked about the homework, he asked Alexa for the homework before his mother redirected his attention back to the clinician. His mother also helped him elaborate on some of his responses when saying “such as___” to elicit specific examples.   When  introducing  content  for  week  4,  M.A.  was  asked  various  questions  to  gather  specific  use cases. M.A. was asked what kind of music he listens to, what time of information he listens to, and any facts he would like to know. M.A.’s mother prompted M.A. to specify some of his responses by asking him some follow up questions such as “Who do you listen to every  morning  with  your  father?”  and  “Is  there  anything  in  history  that  you'd  like  a  fact  about?  OK, what would be an example of something in history?”.  When  M.A.  produced  commands  for  the  weather,  a  news  flash  briefing  and  information  about current events. (1/1 opportunities for each command). When prompted to ask for traffic updates, M.A. required some support in that the device wanted a specific address for the location he was asking for. M.A. was prompted to give the name of a place to avoid giving a specific address. Throughout the session, M.A. was verbally prompted by his mother to mute and unmute his device x2 when giving a command.  Plan  (P):   Work  on  expansion  on  utterances  and  to  slow  down  speech  rate  in  order  for  Alexa  to  pick  up  commands. The clinicians told all the participants about receiving and submitting the weekly homework assignment.   Homework  Assignment:  This  week,  we  learned  about  commands  related  to  news  and  facts.  Please  practice  these  five commands with your Alexa.

       " '  Subjective  (S):  MA  logged  in  for  the  session  on  time  accompanied  by  his  mother.  MA  was  cooperative and motivated by his mother and the clinicians to elaborate on his responses and complete the training related to VAT use during meal preparation   Objective  (O):  Before  beginning  the  assessment,  mother  reported  that  MA  was  able  to  connect his calendar on ICloud to the Echo Show.   User  Needs  Assessment:  During  the  assessment,  MA  answered  questions  about  his  involvement in preparing the meal, dietary restrictions and 10 user scenarios. MA reported that his parents mostly do the cooking. He sometimes helps with slicing vegetables and stirring the pot. He reported being allergic to coconut but no other dietary restrictions.   Scenarios  where  VAT  use  would  be  beneficial  to  MA  included  the  following:   Using  skill  to  set  timer,  finding  substitutions  for  coconut,  Finding  recipes  to  make  mac  and  cheese, how to use certain kitchen tools and searching for more information on ingredients making shopping lists for Costco.   Alexa  training/command  practice:  MA  practiced  the  following  commands  related  to  meal  preparation and dietary restrictions:   “Hey  Alexa,  can  you  tell  me  substitutions  for  coconut?”  “Alexa  read  (show)  me  the  most  popular  recipes”   “Alexa,  Can  you  show  me  a  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese?”  “Alexa,  can  you  go  to  the  next  step?”  “Alexa  can  you  repeat?”  “Alexa,  can  you  repeat  the  step?”  “Alexa,  can  you  find  an  read  me  the  options  for  mac  and  cheese  recipes”  Hey,  Alexa,  add  shampoo  to  my  shopping  list.”  “Hey  Alexa  read  me  the  shopping  list”  “Hey  Alexa  clear  me  shopping  list”  “Hey  Alexa,  check  off  gum”  “Hey  Alexa,  find  me  a  gluten  free  recipe  for  mac  and  cheese”   “Read  me  option  one”  “Alexa,  read  me  option  two”  “Alexa  find  me  a  substitution  for  coconut  milk”  Alexa,  what  a  vegan  or  vegetarian  recipes”  “Hey  Alexa,  what’s  a  vegetarian  pizza  made  out  of?”  “Alexa,  read  me  the  next  recipe”  “Hey  alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie?”  “Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  peanut  butter  cookie?”  Hey  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  Ritz  crackers?”   MA  completed  the  training  part  of  the  session  by  producing  most  of  the  commands  accurately in a single attempt. However, he needed min to mod cues to speak louder and slowing down his rate of speech. On one instance, MA forgot to add the wake word where he needed prompting. Assessment  (A):    User  Needs  Assessment:  MA  required  several  verbal  prompts  from  his  mother  to  think  about  the user scenarios. Blindness makes it a lot more challenging to participate in a complex activity like cooking and meal preparations. However, with assistance of his mother, he was able to come up with few appropriate scenarios where Alexa would be beneficial for assisting MA with respect to meal preparation related questions and recipe finding.   Alexa  Training  /Command  practice:  MA  produced  almost  all  commands  independently  but  he  needed assistance from his mom when engaging in multi-step commands such as requiring follow up answers to questions during the cooking instructions. Mother prompted MA to talk louder. Echo  show  did  not  provide  verbal  output  for  recipes  and  selection  of  a  particular  mac  and  cheese recipe was challenging for MA secondary to his blindness. Even with the utterance “Alexa, find and read me the recipe for mac and cheese” led to visual output only. Therefore, picking up a recipe from the options was difficult. The same problem was experienced with finding gluten free mac and cheese recipes and picking an option with command “ Alexa, read me option one” led to Alexa opening up Audible.com as it processed this command as MA wanting to read a book. Using an Echo dot with one of the clinicians prompted MA to ask if he wanted to hear the recipe and made it easier with provision of verbal output.   Plan  (P):  MA’s  mother  voiced  concerns  about  lack  of  verbal  output  and  inability  to  use  the  device without accessibility modifications. Accessibility mods are possible however this will require further training with an AT/accessibility specialist which they didn’t necessarily have access to. MA may want to use a device without a screen such as an Echo Dot to allow for more verbal output. Hence making it more accessible without extra training and therefore, increasing his involvement with complex ADLs like cooking  Home  exercise  program:  :    Task  1:  Finding  substitutions  (dietary  restrictions)  Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  substitute  for  coconut  milk  in  vegan  mac  and  cheese   Task  2:  Finding  recipes  (*  use  echo  dot  or  a  device  without  screens  to  get  verbal  output  for  this command to work for MA) Command  1:  Alexa,  find  me  a  recipe  for  Mac  and  cheese  Command  2:  Alexa,  find  me  gluten  free  mac  and  cheese  recipe   Command  3:  Alexa,  read  me  option  1   Task  3:  Getting  ingredients  for  a  particular  recipe  Command  1:  Alexa,  tell  me  the  ingredients  to  make  mac  and  cheese  *Alexa  might  ask  follow  up  questions  if  a  particular  recipe  is  not  picked  yet  Command  2:  “Alexa,  add  the  ingredients  to  the  shopping  list”   Task  4:  Steps  to  follow  a  recipe   Command  1:  Alexa,  read  me  the  steps  to  make  mac  and  cheese  one  at  a  time  Command  2:  Alexa,  repeat  step  2  Command  3:  Alexa  pause  the  recipe    Task  3:  Shopping  list:   Command  1:  “Alexa,  add  gum  to  my  shopping  list”  Command  2:  “Alexa,  read  me  my  shopping  list”   Command  3:  “Alexa,  check  off  gum  from  my  shopping  list  Command  4:  “Alexa,  clear  my  shopping  list”   Task  4:  Finding  caloric  intake/grams  of  sodium/sugar  etc   Command  1:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sugar  are  in  a  chocolate  chip  cookie  Command  2:  Alexa,  how  many  grams  of  sodium  are  in  a  Ritz  crackers”   ']"
